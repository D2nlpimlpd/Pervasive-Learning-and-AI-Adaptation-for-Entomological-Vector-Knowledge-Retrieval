Found in Guangdong, Yunnan, Tibet (Medog), and internationally in the Philippines (Luzon Island, the type locality), Indonesia, and India.\",9\n3015,MEDOG,\"\n\nMedog is a county located in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, recognized as a significant ecological and geographical entity within the region. It is particularly notable for its associations with various species of flies, including *Isomyia viridiscutellata*, which is documented to inhabit the area. The county also serves as a domestic distribution site for *Dichaetomyia* species, indicating their presence and ecological relevance in the local environment. Furthermore, Medog is linked to the distribution of *Helina hirtifemorata*, another fly species that contributes to the region's biodiversity. These three species—*Isomyia viridiscutellata*, *Dichaetomyia*, and *Helina hirtifemorata*—are all associated with Medog, underscoring its role as a key location for studying the geographic range and ecological dynamics of these insects. The descriptions collectively emphasize Medog's importance in entomological research, particularly for understanding the habitats and distribution patterns of fly species in the Tibetan region. While the provided data does not specify the exact ecological interactions or conservation status of these species in Medog, their documented presence highlights the area's contribution to the broader biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau. The county's unique environmental conditions, likely influenced by its high-altitude terrain and regional climate, may support the specific ecological niches required by these species. Medog thus stands as a focal point for scientific studies on insect distribution, offering insights into the adaptability and survival of these species in challenging alpine ecosystems. The consistency across the descriptions reinforces the reliability of Medog's association with all three species, with no contradictory information to resolve. In summary, Medog is a Tibetan county of ecological interest, known for its documented connections to *Isomyia viridiscutellata*, *Dichaetomyia* species, and *Helina hirtifemorata*, making it a valuable site for entomological and environmental research.

It serves as a type locality for multiple species, including the genus *Dichaetomyia* and the specific species *Helina hirtifemorata*. A type locality is the geographic location where a species is first identified, described, and formally named, making Luzon Island an important site in entomological taxonomy. The island’s diverse ecosystems, ranging from tropical forests to coastal habitats, likely contribute to its role as a biodiversity hotspot where new species are documented. While the descriptions provided highlight its association with these two distinct species, they do not conflict, as both references align with Luzon Island’s status as a key location for scientific classification.
