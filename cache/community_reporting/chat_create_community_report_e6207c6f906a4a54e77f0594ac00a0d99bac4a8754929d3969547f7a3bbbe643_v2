Among these, QUO is credited with the formal description of *毛腹绿蝇* (a species of greenbottle fly, likely *Lucilia* or *Sarcophaga* genus, though the exact scientific name is not provided in the data). Additionally, QUO authored the species description for *1339上海细麻蝇* (Shanghai Fine Tachinid Fly, scientific name unspecified), as well as *Sarcophaga parva* (Small Flesh Fly). The entity also described *1355 Small Gray Pierretia Fly* (scientific name *Pierretia* sp. 1355) and *PIERRETIACRINITULA* (a species within the *Pierretia* genus, likely *Pierretia crinitula*). QUO is further associated with the 1952 description of *Lucilia laoshanensis*, a species commonly referred to as the Laoshan Ampullacea Greenbottle Fly.  \n\nThe data indicates that QUO’s work in 1952 focused on dipteran (true fly) species, particularly within the families Sarcophagidae (flesh flies) and Calliphoridae (blow flies). The species *Sarcophaga parva* and *Lucilia laoshanensis* are explicitly linked to QUO, while the others (*1339上海细麻蝇*, *1355 Small Gray Pierretia Fly*, *PIERRETIACRINITULA*, and *毛腹绿蝇*) are also attributed to them, though some require clarification. For instance, *PIERRETIACRINITULA* and *1355 Small Gray Pierretia Fly* may refer to the same species, as both are described in 1952 and share the genus *Pierretia*. Similarly, *毛腹绿蝇* and *Lucilia laoshanensis* are both associated with QUO, but the former’s scientific name is not fully specified. The term \"\"1339上海细麻蝇\"\" appears to be a catalog or regional identifier for a species, possibly a tachinid fly, though its full taxonomic classification is unclear.  \n\nQUO’s contributions highlight their role in entomological taxonomy, particularly in documenting Chinese fly species during the mid-20th century. The repeated mention of 1952 suggests this was a significant year for their research output. While some species names are presented in Chinese or with numerical prefixes (e.g., 1339, 1355), the scientific names provided (*Sarcophaga parva*, *Lucilia laoshanensis*, and *Pierretia* sp.) align with standard taxonomic practices. The lack of full binomial nomenclature for certain entries (e.g., *毛腹绿蝇*, *1339上海细麻蝇*) may reflect incomplete data or alternative naming conventions in historical records.  \n\nIn summary, QUO is a 1952 author of several fly species, including *Sarcophaga parva*, *Lucilia laoshanensis*, and at least three *Pierretia* species (1355 Small Gray Pierretia Fly, *PIERRETIACRINITULA*, and an unspecified *毛腹绿蝇*). Their work also includes the Shanghai Fine Tachinid Fly (1339上海细麻蝇), though its scientific name remains unlisted. These contributions underscore QUO’s expertise in dipteran taxonomy and their impact on classifying regional insect biodiversity. The descriptions are consistent in attributing all species to QUO in 1952, with minor ambiguities in nomenclature resolved by contextualizing the likely relationships between common and scientific names.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",7\n5122,1355 SMALL GRAY PIERRETIAS,,4\n5126,PIERRETIACRINITULA,\"A species of fly described by Quo in 1952, distributed in Jiangsu, Shanghai (type locality), Zhejiang in China, and Hokkaido, Honshu, Okinawa, and other Japanese islands, as well as Korea\",4\n3619,LUCILIA LAOSHANENSIS,Species name with authorship by Quo (1952),2\n4886,SARCOPHAGA PARVA,\"Previously named species (Quo, 1952) later renamed to Heteronychia quoi.\",2\n3626,LUCILIA (CAESARICEPS) AMPULLACEA LAOSHANENSIS,\"A species of greenbottle fly described by Quo in 1952, associated with Laoshan as its type locality\",3\n3615,LAOSHAN,\"\n\nLaoshan is a geographical location in Shandong, China, recognized as the type locality for two distinct species: the Laoshan Ampullacea Greenbottle Fly and *Lucilia laoshanensis*.

The Laoshan Ampullacea Greenbottle Fly, a member of the blow fly family (Calliphoridae), is specifically associated with this area, which likely provided the environmental or ecological context necessary for its identification. Similarly, *Lucilia laoshanensis*, a species within the genus *Lucilia* (commonly known for blow flies), is also tied to Laoshan as its type locality, indicating that the species was first documented there. While the descriptions emphasize Laoshan’s role in entomology, the entity is broadly identified as a location in Shandong, China, underscoring its regional significance.

This entity is also linked to **Chongqing City**, which serves as the type locality for the \"\"1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly,\"\" a species likely classified under the genus *Pierretia* (family Tephritidae, true flies). The apparent contradiction between Sichuan and Chongqing is resolved by recognizing that GELESHAN may refer to a broader ecological or administrative region encompassing both areas, or the descriptions could reflect separate, localized references. In either case, the entity is tied to two distinct species: *Graciliforceps sarcophaga*, a sarcophagid fly (family Sarcophagidae) known for its slender morphology, and the Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly, a tephritid species whose name suggests a preference for slender-leaved host plants. Both regions—Sichuan and Chongqing—are significant in entomological studies, with GELESHAN acting as a key locality for these species. The data highlights the ecological diversity of the area, supporting the presence of specialized insect fauna.
