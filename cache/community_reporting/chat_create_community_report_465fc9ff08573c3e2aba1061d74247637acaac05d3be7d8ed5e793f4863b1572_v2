The area is notable for its association with several species of flies, particularly within the families Muscidae and Calliphoridae. Specifically, the Qilian Mountains are the location in Qinghai where *Pegomya prominens* is documented, a species often linked to specific environmental conditions found in alpine or high-altitude ecosystems. Additionally, the mountain range is reported to be the habitat of *Calliphora rohdendorfi*, a blow fly species that may play a role in decomposition processes or forensic studies in the region. The distribution of *Lispe cinifera*, a member of the family Muscidae, is also noted in the Qilian Mountains, further highlighting the area's biodiversity. Importantly, the Qilian Mountains in Qinghai serve as the type locality for *Drymeia tibetana*, a species whose classification and ecological role are tied to this specific geographic origin. \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize the presence of these insect species, they collectively underscore the Qilian Mountains' role as a critical ecological zone in Qinghai, supporting diverse arthropod populations. The mountain range's high-altitude environment likely contributes to the unique adaptations and distributions of these species, which are studied for their taxonomic significance and ecological functions. No contradictions exist among the provided data, as all descriptions consistently identify the Qilian Mountains as a location in Qinghai, China, associated with these specific fly species. The summary integrates all entities and their relationships, presenting a unified account of the region's biological relevance. \n\n(Word count: 150)\",2\n1883,NOVA ACTA ACADEMIA CAESAR LEOPOLD CAROLIN,A journal publishing Drymeia tibetana in 1911.>,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3157,DRYMEIA TIBETANA,SCHNABL,Schnabl co-described Drymeia tibetana with Dziedzicki in 1911,43\n3159,DRYMEIA TIBETANA,QILIAN MOUNTAINS,\"The species Drymeia tibetana was first collected in Qilian Mountains, Qinghai\",7\n3161,DRYMEIA TIBETANA,NOVA ACTA ACADEMIA CAESAR LEOPOLD CAROLIN,Drymeia tibetana was published in Nova Acta Academia Caesar Leopold Carolin,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
