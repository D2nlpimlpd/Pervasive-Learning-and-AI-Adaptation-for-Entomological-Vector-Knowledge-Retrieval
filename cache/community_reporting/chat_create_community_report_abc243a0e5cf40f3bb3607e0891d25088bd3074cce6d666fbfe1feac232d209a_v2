Additionally, the province has a documented history of introducing the **Lixophaga parva** species multiple times between 1955 and 1957 as part of biological control efforts targeting the sugarcane borer, an agricultural pest. This introduction of *L. parva* reflects a strategic approach to managing pest populations in the region’s sugarcane crops, a critical component of Taiwan Province’s agricultural economy. The presence of both native and introduced species highlights the area’s ecological diversity and its role in applied entomology practices. While the Pegoplata species are part of the local biodiversity, the repeated introductions of *L. parva* underscore human intervention in ecological management. The descriptions provided align in identifying Taiwan Province as a Chinese region with specific biological characteristics, though they focus on distinct species and their associated contexts. No contradictions exist between the two statements, as they address different aspects of the province’s ecological profile.
