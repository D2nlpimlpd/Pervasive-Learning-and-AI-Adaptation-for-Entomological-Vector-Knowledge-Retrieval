This genus is distinguished by specific morphological traits, particularly in its wing venation and bristle patterns, which are key characteristics used to classify and identify its members. As part of the Tachinidae family, Austrophorocera species are parasitoid flies, typically playing a role in regulating populations of their host insects. The placement of the genus within the Exoristini tribe further situates it among a group of tachinids known for their ecological and taxonomic diversity. The original description by Townsend established the foundational taxonomy, while subsequent studies have emphasized the diagnostic features of wing structure and bristle arrangement as critical for differentiating Austrophorocera from related genera. These traits contribute to the broader understanding of tachinid fly evolution and systematics, highlighting the genus’s significance in entomological research. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the taxonomic classification, the describer, and the defining morphological attributes.
