It serves as a domestic distribution location for multiple genera and species, including *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Eutrichota similis*, and *Lydella grisescens* alongside *Phryxe vulgaris*. The province hosts several *Helina* species, such as *Helina calceataeformis*, *Helina quadrum*, *Helina hirtifemorata*, *Helina hengshanensis*, and *Helina obscuratoides*, with the Yanbei region and Lin County specifically noted for some. *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca bezzii*, and *Musca conducens* are also part of its insect diversity, as is *Platymyia hortulana* and *Zenillia dolosa*.  \n\nShanxi is home to various *Phaonia* species, including *Phaonia datongensis*, *Phaonia submontana*, *Phaonia vulpinus*, *Phaonia graciloides*, *Phaonia xingxianensis*, *Phaonia wenshuiensis*, *Phaonia yanggaoensis*, *Phaonia longifurca*, *Phaonia fuscata*, and *Phaonia xiangningensis* and *Phaonia youyuensis*. These are found in locations like Xingxian, Taiyuan, and Lin County. The province also supports *Lydella grisescens*, *Phorbia securis xibeina* (type locality at Nanmewan, Yan’an), *Servaisia rossica*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, and *Parasarcophaga polystylata*.  \n\nNotable species include *Leucophora shanxiensis* and *Leucophora personata*, with *Leucophora dorsalis* specifically recorded in Taiyuan. *Coenosia* species such as *Coenosia dilatitarsis*, *Coenosia mollicula*, *Coenosia incisurata*, and *Coenosia strigipes* are present, as are *Hydrotaea bimaculatoides* and *Hydrotaea occulta*. The genus *Adia* and *Polleniopsis mongolica* are documented, along with *Mydaea discimana* and *Mydaea laxidetrita*.  \n\nShanxi’s insect records extend to *Lispe monochaita* and *Lispe loewi*, *Muscina assimilis* in Xingxian, *Pseudonupedia intersecta* in Taiyuan, and *Nupedia aestiva*, *Nupedia patellans*, and *Nupedia infirma*. The province is also associated with *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, *Blaesoxipha litoralis*, and *Cynomya mortuorum*. Specific localities like Jinci (Taiyuan) and Hanzhong are highlighted for *Egle cyrtacra* and *Graphomya rufitibia*, respectively.  \n\nShanxi has been a focus for entomological surveys, including work by the Shanxi Medical College. Its regions, such as Nanmifan, Huanglongshan, Ziwuling, and the Qinling Mountains, are noted for species like *Kramerea schuetzei* and *Pales pavida* (blue-black bristle fly). The province’s biodiversity includes rare or regionally significant species, such as *1278靴折麻蝇* and *1279膨端折麻蝇*, as well as *1351 Microspine Pierretia Fly*.  \n\nHowever, some descriptions mistakenly reference Shaanxi (e.g., *Calliphora axata* in Xi’an, *Musca sorbens* in Yulin) and should be excluded from Shanxi’s summary. The correct focus remains on Shanxi’s own distribution of species like *Fannia scalaris*, *Fannia similis*, *Hebecnema alba*, *Paraprosalpia tibialis*, and *Xenotachina fumifemoralis*.  \n\nIn total, Shanxi’s entomological profile reflects a rich and varied ecosystem, with multiple species of medical, agricultural, and ecological interest. Key areas for study include Taiyuan, Yan’an, and the Yanbei region, where specific species like *Phaonia mimofausta* (Ying County, Hanyuan) and *类绒粪泉蝇* (Lin County) are recorded. The province’s role in species surveys and collections underscores its importance in understanding China’s insect biodiversity.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",123\n1060,LEUCOPHORA SHANXIENSIS,\"Leucophora shanxiensis is a species of fly in the genus Leucophora, described by Fan and Wang in 1982, with short arista and distributed in Shanxi\",4\n3374,PHANOIA RUFIVULGARIS,\"A species of fly described by Xue and Wang in 1989, with holotype locality in Fanjiayao, Youyu, Shanxi\",4\n3519,\"ZHANG, ZHAO ET WU\",Described Phaonia shanxiensis in 1985,4\n3532,PUBLICATION IN ACTA ZOOLOGICA SINICA 10(2):178,Publication of Phaonia xiangningensis in Acta Zoologica Sinica issue 10(2):178,3\n3535,PUBLICATION IN ACTA ZOOLOGICA SINICA 14(3):351,Publication of Phaonia youyuensis in Acta Zoologica Sinica issue 14(3):351,3\n2071,XI'AN,\"\n\nXi'an is a city located in Shaanxi province, China, and is recognized as a habitat for *Musca bezzii*, a species of housefly.

This taxonomic group is characterized by distinct morphological features that aid in its identification. Notably, members of the genus exhibit **mostly bare eyes**, a trait that differentiates them from other related genera. In males, a defining characteristic is the **narrow forehead**, which contributes to their unique appearance. Additionally, the genus is distinguished by specific anatomical traits in the **wings and abdomen**, though the exact nature of these features is not detailed in the provided descriptions. As part of the Mydaeinae subfamily, *Mydaea* species are likely to share broader taxonomic and ecological traits with other members of this group, which includes small to medium-sized flies often associated with decaying organic matter or specific host environments. The combination of these physical attributes and subfamily classification provides a foundational understanding of *Mydaea* within the context of dipteran taxonomy.
