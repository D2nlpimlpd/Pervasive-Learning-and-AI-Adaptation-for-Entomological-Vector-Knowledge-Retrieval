He described numerous species across multiple genera, with his work spanning from 1825 to 1860. In 1825, Walker first documented *Hylemya detracta*, marking an early milestone in his career. By 1849, he had described several species, including *Mikia tepens*, *Halydaia luteicornis*, *Dexia aurinia*, and *Sisyropa prominens*. His 1857 publications were particularly prolific, featuring the description of *Idia bivittata*, *Myospila argentata*, *Borbororhinia bivittata*, *Musca exempta*, and *Cynomya fortis*. \n\nIn 1858, Walker contributed to the taxonomy of blowflies by describing *Chrysomya pinguis* (later reclassified as *Chrysomya (Compsomyia) pinguis*), a species commonly known as the Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly. The same year, he also documented the host species *Leucania separata*. By 1859, Walker’s work expanded to include the establishment of the genus *Neomyia* and the description of its type species *Musca (Neomyia) gavisa*. That year, he also described *Sisyropa prominens*, *Pygophora respondens*, and *Seniorwhitea reciproca*. In 1860, he added *Sarcorohdendorfia inextricata* to the scientific record. \n\nWalker’s 1856 contributions included *Sarcophaga reciproca* (now *Sarcophaga sericea*), *Sarcophaga misera*, and *Anthomyia illocata*. Additionally, he described the genus *Cosmina* and the species *Isomyia delectans* in entomological taxonomy. His work on *Musca conducens* and *Neomyia gavisa* further solidified his role in defining key taxa within the Diptera order. \n\nDespite some inconsistencies in the data (e.g., conflicting years for *Myospila argentata* and *Pygophora respondens*), the majority of sources align on Walker’s primary role as a taxonomist who described these species between 1849 and 1860. His legacy is preserved in the naming of genera and species, reflecting his systematic approach to classifying flies and their ecological relationships. Walker’s descriptions remain foundational in entomology, particularly for the genera *Neomyia*, *Sarcophaga*, and *Chrysomya*, as well as species like *Anthomyia illocata* and *Borbororhinia bivittata*.
