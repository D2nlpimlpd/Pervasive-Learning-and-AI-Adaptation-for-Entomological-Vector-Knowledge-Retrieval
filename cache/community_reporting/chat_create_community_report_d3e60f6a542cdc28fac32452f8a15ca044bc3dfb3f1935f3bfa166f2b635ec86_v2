It serves as a key distribution zone for several fly genera and species, including *Paradichosia*, *Gymnadichosia*, *Pollenomyia*, *Melinda*, *Harpagophalla*, and *Gasterophilus*. The region is characterized by its biodiversity, with certain genera like *Harpagophalla* and *Gasterophilus* having specific distribution patterns within it. For instance, *Harpagophalla kempi* is explicitly noted as being distributed in the Oriental Region, while *Gasterophilus* species are found in eastern Asia, a part of the broader 东洋区. \n\nThe descriptions highlight that the Oriental Region is not a monolithic area but includes sub-regions such as the \"\"Eastern Oriental region,\"\" where some genera, like *Harpagophalla*, are marginally distributed in highland areas. This suggests a gradient of ecological specialization, with certain species confined to higher elevations or more restricted habitats within the region. Additionally, the 东洋区 is described as a primary distribution area for the mentioned fly genera, indicating its significance in their evolutionary and ecological contexts. \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to the Oriental Region as a general biogeographic framework for fly species, others emphasize its role as a specific zone for particular genera. For example, *Paradichosia*, *Gymnadichosia*, *Pollenomyia*, and *Melinda* are primarily associated with the 东洋区, underscoring its importance in their geographic ranges. The term \"\"Oriental Region\"\" is also used in broader taxonomic literature to describe the distribution of fly genera, aligning with the 东洋区’s definition. \n\nThe apparent contradiction between the \"\"Eastern Oriental region\"\" and the general \"\"Oriental Region\"\" is resolved by recognizing the former as a sub-region within the latter. The marginal distribution of *Harpagophalla* in highland areas of the Eastern Oriental region reflects localized adaptations, whereas the core 东洋区 supports a wider array of species. Similarly, the mention of the Oriental Region as a \"\"biogeographic region where certain Gasterophilus species are distributed\"\" and \"\"a part of Asia\"\" harmonizes with the Chinese description of its tropical and subtropical focus. \n\nIn summary, the **东洋区** is a biogeographic region in tropical and subtropical Asia, serving as a primary or marginal habitat for multiple fly genera and species. It includes sub-regions like the Eastern Oriental region, where highland distributions are observed, and overlaps with eastern Asia for *Gasterophilus*. The region’s ecological diversity supports the primary ranges of *Paradichosia*, *Gymnadichosia*, *Pollenomyia*, and *Melinda*, while *Harpagophalla kempi* is specifically tied to the broader Oriental Region. This synthesis integrates all provided data, clarifying hierarchical relationships and resolving minor discrepancies in terminology.
