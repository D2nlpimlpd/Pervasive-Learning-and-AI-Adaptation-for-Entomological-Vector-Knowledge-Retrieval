Additionally, Gansu is home to *Helina* species, including *Helina calceataeformis* (type locality in Huashan), *Helina quadrum*, *Helina confinis*, and *Helina qilianshanensis* (specifically in the Qilian Mountains, its type locality). The province also supports the distribution of *Musca* species like *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca larvipara*, *Musca bezzii*, *Musca conducens*, and *Musca sorbens*, as well as *Protophormia terraenovae* and *Phormia regina* (noted in Sunan and Lanzhou). \n\nGansu is a key location for the genus *Parasarcophaga*, with *Parasarcophaga aegyptica* and *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata* recorded there. The region is also associated with *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, *Drymeia vicana*, *Pegomya crinilamella*, *Hylemya probilis*, *Megophyra simpliceps*, and *Lasiomma curtigena* (found in Lanzhou, Xinglongshan, and Qingshui). Specific localities within Gansu, such as Wen County (type locality for *Delia sphaerobasis* and *Pseudonupedia intersecta*), Qingyang, Tianshui, and Qingshui, are highlighted for their unique species assemblages, including *Delia coarctata* and *Bellardia menechmoides* (Tianshui). \n\nThe province is noted for its pastoral areas, which support species like *Haematobia* and *Wohlfahrtia bella*. Chinese names for species found in Gansu include 紫翠蝇 (*Zicui fly*), 孟氏翠蝇 (*Meng’s翠蝇*), 棕尾别麻蝇 (*Saddleback fine fly*), and 秉氏亚麻蝇 (*Bing’s subfine fly*), alongside the 1338 Zhouqu fine fly and 1352 Lingulate Pierretia Fly. Gansu’s biodiversity is further enriched by the presence of *Dasyphora gansuensis*, *Delia gansuensis*, *Eutrichota* species (type locality in Yuzhong), *Egle anthomyioides* (type locality in Gansu), and *Paregle audacula*. The city of Lanzhou, a major urban center in Gansu, is linked to the distribution of *Phormia regina* and *Gonia bimaculata*. \n\nGansu’s ecological significance is underscored by its role as a domestic distribution hub for genera like *Adia*, *SPALLANZANIA*, and *ARGYOPHYLAX*, as well as species such as *Lasiomma graciliapicum* (type locality in Diebu) and *Sanchan Tan* as a noted site for species diversity.

As a major urban center in the region, Lanzhou is situated along the Yellow River and is known for its historical, cultural, and economic importance in northwestern China. The city’s association with these species highlights its ecological relevance in entomological studies. *Parasarcophaga aegyptica*, a parasitoid fly, is documented to inhabit areas within Lanzhou, contributing to local biodiversity and potentially playing a role in pest control or ecosystem dynamics. Similarly, *Lasiomma curtigena*, a species of cicada, is also reported to be distributed in the city, indicating the presence of suitable habitats for its life cycle, such as forests or shrublands. The repeated mention of Lanzhou’s connection to these species across the descriptions underscores its status as a key location for their study and conservation. While the descriptions do not provide specific details about the ecological interactions or population trends of these species, they collectively affirm Lanzhou’s role in their geographic range. The city’s climate, characterized by cold winters and hot summers, and its semi-arid environment may influence the distribution patterns of both organisms. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions consistently identify Lanzhou as a city in Gansu Province, China, and link it to the presence of these species.
