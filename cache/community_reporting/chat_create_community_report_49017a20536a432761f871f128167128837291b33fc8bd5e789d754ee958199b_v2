Its presence in Kagoshima aligns with its broader ecological adaptability across temperate and tropical regions. Meanwhile, *Musca sorbens*, or the stable fly, is a blood-feeding pest typically found in agricultural and livestock areas, known for its impact on animal health and productivity. The stable fly’s distribution in Kagoshima suggests the region may have environments conducive to its lifecycle, such as proximity to grazing lands or organic waste sources. \n\nWhile both descriptions highlight Kagoshima’s role in the geographic spread of these species, they refer to separate biological contexts. *Musca conducens* is more generalist in habitat selection, whereas *Musca sorbens* thrives in specific conditions tied to animal husbandry. The coexistence of these species in Kagoshima underscores the city’s ecological diversity and potential as a hub for entomological study. No contradictions exist between the provided data, as the two species are distinct in their biology and habitat preferences.
