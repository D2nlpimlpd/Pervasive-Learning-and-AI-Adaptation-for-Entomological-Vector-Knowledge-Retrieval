His work in 1978 also documented the distribution of *Chirosia similata* in the same region, specifically in Benxi Nandian.  \n\nIn 1973, Xue Wanqi authored a report on fly species in the *Entomological Journal* and a more detailed study on *Chionomyia vetula* in *Acta Entomologica Sinica*. The latter study, conducted while affiliated with Shenyang Normal University, provided critical insights into the third-instar larval morphology and breeding habits of *Chionomyia vetula*, advancing understanding of its life cycle. Additionally, he collected specimens of *Limnophora purgata* in Benxi, Liaoning, further demonstrating his role in documenting regional dipteran biodiversity.  \n\nXue Wanqi’s research spans both fieldwork and academic publication, with a particular emphasis on the taxonomy, ecology, and distribution of flies in northeastern China. His affiliation with Shenyang Normal University during the 1970s and 1980s underscores his institutional role in entomological studies, and his contributions to a book (specific title unspecified) highlight his collaborative efforts in compiling scientific knowledge.
