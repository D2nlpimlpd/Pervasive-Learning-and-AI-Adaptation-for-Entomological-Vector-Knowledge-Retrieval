This area is ecologically significant as it is associated with the **Oestromyia** genus, a group of flies within the family Oestridae, which are known for their parasitic larvae. The Sayan Mountains serve as a habitat for species within this genus, contributing to the biodiversity of the region. Additionally, the **Oestroderma schubini**, a specific species of fly, is documented to be distributed within the Sayan Mountains. While **Oestromyia** and **Oestroderma** are distinct genera, their presence in the same geographical area highlights the ecological richness and potential for diverse parasitic and host interactions in the region. The Sayan Mountains, spanning parts of southern Siberia and northern Mongolia, are characterized by their temperate and alpine ecosystems, which likely support the life cycles of these insects. Together, these descriptions underscore the importance of the Sayan Mountains as a location where both the **Oestromyia** genus and the **Oestroderma schubini** species are found, reflecting the area’s role in the broader context of entomological and ecological studies.\",1\n6072,ALTAY MOUNTAINS,A mountain range in Siberia linked to Oestroderma schubini's distribution,1\n6073,TIANSHAN MOUNTAINS,\"\n\nThe Tianshan Mountains, a prominent mountain range in Central Asia, are notable for their ecological and geographical significance. Spanning across regions including China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, the Tianshan range is characterized by its high-altitude terrain, diverse ecosystems, and role as a biodiversity hotspot. The mountains are associated with the **Oestromyia** genus, a group of flies within the family Oestridiidae, which are known to inhabit alpine and subalpine environments. Additionally, the Tianshan Mountains serve as a key distribution area for **Oestroderma schubini**, a species within the Oestroderma genus, further highlighting the region’s importance as a habitat for specialized myiasis-causing flies. These organisms are linked to the unique climatic and ecological conditions of the Tianshan, such as its cold, arid environments and the presence of suitable host species. The coexistence of both the Oestromyia genus and Oestroderma schubini in the region underscores the Tianshan Mountains’ role in supporting a range of insect life adapted to high-altitude ecosystems. While the specific ecological interactions or host preferences of these species remain under study, their presence in the Tianshan aligns with the broader pattern of the mountain range acting as a refuge for endemic and specialized fauna. The Tianshan’s biodiversity is further enriched by its varied topography, which includes glaciers, alpine meadows, and coniferous forests, creating distinct microhabitats for such species. Conservation efforts in the region are critical to preserving these ecological niches, as climate change and human activity pose potential threats to the delicate balance of high-altitude ecosystems. Overall, the Tianshan Mountains are a vital area for understanding the distribution and adaptation of myiasis-related insects, with both the Oestromyia genus and Oestroderma schubini contributing to the region’s biological uniqueness.\",1\n6074,TEBA RIVER,\"\n\nThe **Teba River** is a geographical location in Central Asia that holds significance in entomological taxonomy. It is associated with the **Oestromyia** genus, a group of flies within the family Oestridae, and is specifically recognized as the **type locality** (模式产地) for the species **Oestroderma schubini**. The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the geographic site where a species is first discovered and described, serving as a critical reference for its classification. While the first description links the Teba River to the broader Oestromyia genus, the second highlights its role as the specific origin point for *Oestroderma schubini*, a species within the same family. This dual association underscores the river's importance in the study of oestrid flies, particularly for defining the distribution and ecological context of these taxa. The Teba River’s designation as a type locality for *Oestroderma schubini* implies that it is the primary site used to characterize the species, ensuring its scientific name is tied to this Central Asian location. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they collectively emphasize the river’s entomological relevance at both the generic and specific levels. The Teba River thus serves as a key reference in Central Asian biodiversity research, particularly for understanding the taxonomy and habitat of oestrid flies. Its role in documenting *Oestroderma schubini* highlights the region’s contribution to the global inventory of insect species, while its connection to the Oestromyia genus reinforces its ecological and scientific value. Researchers studying these flies may use the Teba River as a baseline for comparative analyses, given its established status in taxonomic literature. The river’s Central Asian location situates it within a broader biogeographical framework, potentially linking it to other arid or semi-arid ecosystems where oestrids are commonly found. Overall, the Teba River is a pivotal site for entomologists, bridging the study of a genus and a specific species within the Oestridae family. Its dual role as both a habitat for Oestromyia and the type locality for *Oestroderma schubini* ensures its prominence in scientific records, facilitating accurate identification and conservation efforts for these insects. The inclusion of the Chinese term \"\"模式产地\"\" (type locality) in the second description aligns with the standard practice of designating such sites in taxonomic work, further clarifying the Teba River’s role in the formal description of *Oestroderma schubini*. This synthesis of information provides a cohesive understanding of the entity’s relevance in both general and species-specific contexts.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11765,OESTRODERMA SCHUBINI,XINJIANG,Oestroderma schubini is distributed in Xinjiang,185\n11766,OESTRODERMA SCHUBINI,SAYAN MOUNTAINS,Oestroderma schubini is distributed in the Sayan Mountains,6\n11767,OESTRODERMA SCHUBINI,ALTAY MOUNTAINS,Oestroderma schubini is distributed in the Altay Mountains,6\n11768,OESTRODERMA SCHUBINI,TIANSHAN MOUNTAINS,Oestroderma schubini is distributed in the Tianshan Mountains,6\n11769,OESTRODERMA SCHUBINI,TEBA RIVER,Teba River is the type locality for Oestroderma schubini,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
