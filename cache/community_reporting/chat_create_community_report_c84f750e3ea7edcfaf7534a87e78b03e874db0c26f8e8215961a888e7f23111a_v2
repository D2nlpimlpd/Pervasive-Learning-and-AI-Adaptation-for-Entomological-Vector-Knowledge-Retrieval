It belongs to the family Stratiomyidae, commonly known as soldier flies, and is distinguished by specific morphological traits. Notably, species within this genus are characterized by yellow wing shoulder scales, a feature that contributes to their visual identification, and a unique abdominal bristle pattern, which is critical for taxonomic classification. These physical attributes help differentiate *Spallanzania* from other genera within the same family.  \n\nThe genus includes multiple species, one of which is *Spallanzania hebes*, a well-documented example. Members of *Spallanzania* are distributed across diverse geographical regions, with records indicating their presence in Beijing and Heilongjiang in China, as well as in Southern Europe. This distribution suggests a broad ecological adaptability, though specific habitat preferences or life cycle details are not provided in the descriptions. The inclusion of both Eastern Asian and European locations highlights the genus’s potential for wide-ranging biodiversity and ecological significance in these areas.  \n\nAs a group, *Spallanzania* flies are part of the larger order Diptera, which encompasses true flies. Their classification under the Stratiomyidae family aligns with other soldier flies, which are typically associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic environments during their larval stages. However, the descriptions do not elaborate on the ecological roles, behaviors, or larval habitats of *Spallanzania* species. The genus’s defining features—yellow wing shoulder scales and abdominal bristle patterns—are emphasized as key diagnostic markers, underscoring the importance of morphological analysis in entomological studies.  \n\nNo contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the genus’s taxonomic origin, physical traits, and regional distribution. The summary integrates all details to present a cohesive overview of *Spallanzania Genus*, emphasizing its historical classification, morphological uniqueness, and geographic presence. Further research into the genus’s ecological functions, species diversity, and conservation status could enhance understanding of its role in ecosystems and evolutionary biology.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",15\n343,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,\"\n\nROBINEAU-DESVOIDY was a 19th-century French entomologist and taxonomist renowned for his extensive contributions to the classification of flies, particularly parasitic species. Active primarily in the 1830s and 1860s, he described numerous genera and species, many of which remain foundational in modern entomology. In 1830, he established or described key genera such as *Aplomyia*, *Adia*, *Spallanzania*, *Mydaea*, *Myospila*, *Egenia*, *Hydrotaea*, *Nemoraea*, *Caricea*, *Limosia*, *Agria*, *Carcelia*, *Helina*, *Morellia*, *Amobia*, *Norellia*, *Pegomya*, *Hylemya*, *Fannia*, *Lucilia*, *Melinda*, *Pyrellia*, and *Phormia*. Notable species from this period include *Calliphora vicina* (Red-headed Calliphora), *Delia floricola*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Lydella maesta*, *Lydella cursoria*, *Hydrotaea cinerea*, *Leucophora cinerea*, *Leucophora sericea*, *Craspedochoeta liturata*, *Cynomya* species, and *Pollenia* in 1830. He also described *Dexia cincta* and *Dexia gracilis*, as well as *Blondelia*, *Meigenia*, and *Zaira* genera.  \n\nBy 1863, Robineau-Desvoidy expanded his work to include genera like *Phryxe* (e.g., *Phryxe praefixa*, *Phryxe fugitiva*, *Phryxe vernalis*), *Eurysthaea* (including *Eurysthaea scutellaris* in 1848 and *Eurysthaea* species in 1863), *Servaisia*, *Pierretia*, *Ravinia*, *Bercaea*, and *Bengalia*. He also described species such as *Macquartia laeta* (1863), *Macquartia villica* (1836), *Blaesoxipha campestris*, *Buquetia musca*, and *Emmesomyia grisea*. His 1863 contributions further solidified his role in tachinid fly taxonomy, with genera like *Lydella*, *Platymyia*, *Zenillia*, and *Buquetia* being highlighted as part of his broader work on parasitic flies.  \n\nRobineau-Desvoidy’s research spanned both morphological and ecological classifications, with a focus on the Palearctic region. He is credited with describing *Egle parva* (1830) and the genus *Egle*, as well as *Delia floricola* and *Myxexoristops blondeli*. His work on *Phorbia* (1830) and *Linnaemya* (1830) added to the understanding of fly diversity. Additionally, he described species such as *Peletieria rubescens* (1830) and *Calythea nigricans* (1830), and contributed to the subgenus *Pierretia (s.str.)* in 1863.  \n\nDespite some inconsistencies in the data (e.g., conflicting years for *Bercaea* and *Eurysthaea*), his legacy is marked by a prolific output in the 1830s and 1860s, with over 30 genera and dozens of species attributed to him. His efforts in organizing parasitic fly taxonomy, including *Aplomyia*, *Phryxe*, and *Lydella*, remain significant. Robineau-Desvoidy’s work on species like *蓝翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis* and *四鬃翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens* (translated as *Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis* and *Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens*) and the *朔粪泉蝇* (likely *Sphingomyia* or a related species) further underscores his global impact.  \n\nAs a French scientist, he was instrumental in advancing 19th-century entomology, with his descriptions of genera like *Drino*, *Cosmina*, and *Bellardia* reflecting his methodical approach to taxonomy. His work on *Chrysomya* (1830) and *Limnophora nigripes* also highlights his role in defining key fly lineages. Overall, Robineau-Desvoidy’s contributions to the classification of Diptera, particularly parasitic and blow flies, remain a cornerstone of entomological science.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",112\n2735,LIMNOPHORA NIGRIPES,\"A fly species with a black abdominal stripe and gray facial markings, described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830, found in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Europe, and North America\",9\n1069,LEUCOPHORA SERICEA,\"\n\nLeucophora sericea is a species of fly (Diptera) first described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. It is characterized by a body length ranging between 6.0–7.5 mm, with some sources specifying a more precise range of 6.5–7.5 mm and others noting a typical length of 6 mm. The species exhibits distinct morphological features, including specific bristle patterns that aid in its identification. Geographically, Leucophora sericea is distributed across several regions: domestically in China, it has been recorded in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hebei, and Qinghai. Internationally, its range extends to Japan and France, the latter of which is noted as the type locality—the original location where the species was first described. The combination of its bristle patterns and body size measurements provides key diagnostic traits for distinguishing it from related species within the genus *Leucophora*. Despite minor discrepancies in reported body lengths, the consensus places it within the 6–7.5 mm range, reflecting natural variation or potential differences in measurement methods. This species is part of the broader ecological and taxonomic context of flies, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitats.\",7\n1317,CALYTHEA NIGRICANS,\"\n\n**Calythea nigricans** is a species of fly belonging to the family Anthomyiidae, which includes root flies rather than flower flies. It was first described by the entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830, though an earlier source erroneously attributes its description to \"\"R.-D.\"\" in 1825. The species is characterized by a distinct morphological feature in males: a single row of lower orbital bristles, and adults typically measure 3.5 mm in body length. \n\nLarvae of *Calythea nigricans* are known to breed in the dung of domestic animals, specifically pigs and cows, as noted in the first description. This ecological trait aligns with the general habits of Anthomyiidae, which often utilize decaying organic matter for larval development. \n\nIn terms of distribution, *Calythea nigricans* is found in several regions. Domestically, it occurs in China, with records from the cities of Beijing, Sichuan, and Shanghai. Internationally, its range extends to Southwest Asia, Europe (including France), North Africa, and both North and South America. This broad geographic presence suggests the species is well-adapted to temperate and subtropical climates, though specific ecological preferences or host associations beyond dung-breeding remain unmentioned in the provided data. \n\nThe discrepancy in the description’s authorship and year (1825 vs. 1830) has been resolved by prioritizing the full name \"\"Robineau-Desvoidy\"\" and the later, more precise date of 1830, which is consistent with historical taxonomic records. The family classification as Anthomyiidae is retained, as the initial reference to \"\"flower fly\"\" appears to be an error, given that flower flies belong to the family Syrphidae. \n\nIn summary, *Calythea nigricans* is a small, bristle-marked root fly with a global distribution spanning multiple continents and a larval ecology tied to livestock dung. Its taxonomic history and morphological traits highlight its role within the Anthomyiidae family, while its widespread occurrence underscores its adaptability to diverse environments.\",6\n2808,CARICEA,\"\n\n**CARICEA** is a genus of flies distinguished by unique morphological characteristics and a broad geographic distribution. It is primarily found in the Palaearctic, Oriental, Afrotropical, and Australian regions, indicating its presence across diverse ecosystems spanning these biogeographic zones. Taxonomically, CARICEA is notable for its distinct bristle patterns, particularly the strong basal scutellum bristles, which are a defining feature of the genus. Additionally, the lower arista (a sensory appendage on the head) is longer than the upper arista, further contributing to its identification. In terms of sexual dimorphism, male CARICEA flies are characterized by the absence of long setae (hairs) on the fifth tergite, a trait that differentiates them from other related genera. These morphological traits—strong scutellum bristles, asymmetrical arista length, and the lack of long setae in males—collectively provide a framework for distinguishing CARICEA from similar fly genera. The genus’s wing features, though not explicitly detailed in the descriptions, are also highlighted as distinctive, suggesting adaptations or structural traits relevant to its ecological niche. Overall, CARICEA represents a taxonomically coherent group within the fly family, with a combination of physical markers and distribution patterns that support its classification and study in entomological research.\",4\n5762,EURYSTHAEAE SCUTELLARIS,\"A species within the Eurysthaea genus, characterized by a black abdomen with white powder bands and a curved anal vein.

This genus is part of the Palaearctic region’s biodiversity, which encompasses a wide geographic range including Europe, Asia north of the Himalayas, and North Africa. Members of the Cynomya genus are characterized by their metallic blue or green coloration, a common trait among many blow flies and hover flies, which often serves as a form of aposematic or mimetic adaptation. Morphologically, they exhibit features typical of the Calliphoridae family, such as robust bodies, prominent eyes, and a distinct pattern of wing venation. These flies are primarily known for their role in forensic entomology, as certain species are early colonizers of decaying organic matter, aiding in the estimation of postmortem intervals. Additionally, their ecological significance extends to decomposition processes and nutrient cycling in various habitats. The genus is taxonomically distinct, with species often identified by specific anatomical traits, including the structure of the proboscis and the arrangement of setae on the thorax and abdomen. While the descriptions provided align on the family classification and physical attributes, the Palaearctic distribution emphasizes their prevalence in temperate and subtropical zones, though some species may extend into adjacent regions. Overall, Cynomya represents a well-defined group within the Calliphoridae family, notable for its metallic coloration, morphological specialization, and ecological roles in decomposition and forensic science.\",3\n5755,EURYSTHAEAE,\"\n\n**Eurysthaea** is a genus of flies within the family Tachinidae, first described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1848. The genus is characterized by a small body size, red-yellow antennae, and distinct morphological features such as bare compound eyes and a black abdomen marked with white powder bands. Wing venation patterns also serve as a key diagnostic trait for members of this group. Eurysthaea species exhibit host-specific ecological traits, though the exact nature of these relationships remains less detailed in the provided data. The type species of the genus is **Eurysthaea scutellaris**, which anchors its taxonomic classification. Geographically, the genus is distributed across China and Europe, indicating a transcontinental range. These flies are notable for their specialized adaptations, which may include parasitic or predatory behaviors linked to their host specificity. The combination of their unique coloration, antennal pigmentation, and wing structure distinguishes them within the broader fly taxonomy.

Additionally, they exhibit a specific 2:2 pattern of abdominal bristles, which refers to the arrangement of bristles on the abdominal segments. Another defining characteristic is the presence of a row of black bristles located behind the postocular bristles on the occiput, the posterior region of the head. These traits, including the wing bristle counts mentioned in the first description, collectively contribute to the taxonomic identification of Lydella within the Tachinidae family. The genus is part of the Eryciini tribe, a group of tachinid flies known for their parasitoid lifestyles, often targeting lepidopteran larvae. The combination of these morphological features—crossed scutellar bristles, abdominal bristle configuration, and occipital black bristles—provides a cohesive framework for classifying Lydella species and understanding their ecological and evolutionary roles. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they complement each other in detailing the genus’s diagnostic characteristics.\",2\n5746,PHRYXE,\"\n\nPHRYXE is a genus of parasitic tachinid flies within the family Tachinidae, first described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. The genus is characterized by its ovoviviparous reproductive strategy, a trait common among tachinid flies where eggs develop inside the mother until they are ready to be laid. Members of PHRYXE, such as the species *Phryxe vulgaris*, exhibit a distinct black body coloration, which is a prominent morphological feature. Additionally, they possess a red-yellowish tip on the scutellum, a triangular plate on the thorax, that serves as a key identifier for the genus. \n\nPHRYXE species are further distinguished by specific bristle arrangements on their mesotibia, the middle segment of the hind leg. These include two frontal bristles and three anterior dorsal bristles, which are critical for taxonomic classification within the genus. The combination of these traits—black bodies, red-yellowish scutellum tips, and the defined bristle patterns—help differentiate PHRYXE from other tachinid genera. As parasitic flies, they play a role in regulating populations of their host insects, though specific host preferences are not detailed in the provided data. The genus remains a subject of entomological study due to its ecological significance and morphological distinctiveness. \n\nBy integrating the descriptions, PHRYXE is confirmed as a tachinid fly genus with a historical taxonomic foundation, unique coloration, and specialized bristle structures, all contributing to its classification and biological role.\",2\n5846,NEMORAEA,\"\n\n**NEMORAEA** is a genus of flies within the tribe Nemoraeini, first described by the entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. The genus is characterized by a suite of morphological features that distinguish it from other members of its tribe. These include the presence of three abdominal bristles, a specific bristle arrangement on the thorax, and a hairy lower surstylus, which is a structure located on the male genitalia. Additionally, species in the genus exhibit a face ridge, a unique facial feature, and specialized abdominal and wing structures that contribute to their taxonomic identification. The combination of these traits—such as the thoracic bristle pattern, the hairy surstylus, and the face ridge—provides a comprehensive framework for classifying and differentiating *Nemoraea* species.  \n\nOne well-documented example within the genus is *Nemoraea pellucida*, which exemplifies the defining characteristics of the group. This species, like others in the genus, is likely to display the three abdominal bristles, the specific thoracic bristle arrangement, and the hairy lower surstylus. The wing and abdominal structures, though not explicitly detailed in the descriptions, are noted as key diagnostic elements, suggesting that these features may vary in form or venation patterns among species but remain consistent within the genus. The face ridge, a prominent trait, further aids in distinguishing *Nemoraea* from closely related genera.  \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in their attribution of the genus to Robineau-Desvoidy (1830) and its placement within the Nemoraeini tribe. While the first description emphasizes abdominal and thoracic bristle arrangements, the second adds details about the surstylus, face ridge, and wing/abdominal structures, all of which are integrated into the summary to reflect the full range of diagnostic traits. The inclusion of *Nemoraea pellucida* as a representative species ensures clarity about the genus's diversity and provides a concrete reference for its morphological features.  \n\nIn summary, *Nemoraea* is a taxonomically distinct genus of flies within the Nemoraeini tribe, defined by its unique combination of bristle patterns, a hairy lower surstylus, a face ridge, and specialized wing and abdominal structures. These characteristics, along with the historical context of its description, underscore its classification and help identify species such as *Nemoraea pellucida* within the group. The synthesis of the provided data resolves any implicit redundancy while maintaining a cohesive and detailed overview of the genus.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",2\n347,NORELLIA PSEUDONARCISI,,1\n648,EGLE PARVA,,1\n1543,EMMESOMYIA GRISEA,,1\n1796,HYDROTAEA CINEREA,A species of fly described by Robineau-Desvoidy,1\n1811,ESSAI MYOD.,Journal where Hydrotaea velutina was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830,1\n1817,ESS.MYOD.511.,A journal or publication where Hydrotaea cinerea was described by Robineau-Desvoidy,1\n2052,FAR EAST SIBERIA,,1\n2380,蓝翠蝇NEOMYIA (ORTHELLIA) TIMORENSIS,,1\n2583,MYOSPIRA,\"A genus of flies described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830, with features including bare wings and distinct abdominal patterns\",1\n2810,LIMOSIA,\"A genus of flies with antennae inserted at the upper third of the eye, a narrow frons (about 1/3 of head width), and parallel lateral margins\",1\n2820,短角秽蝇属LIMOSIA,\"Limosia is a genus described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830.
