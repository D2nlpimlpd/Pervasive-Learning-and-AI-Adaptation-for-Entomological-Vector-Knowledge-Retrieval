As a major urban center in eastern China, Hefei is part of the broader ecological and geographical range where this species is known to occur. The city itself is a significant hub in Anhui province, contributing to regional biodiversity studies and ecological monitoring efforts. The inclusion of Hefei in *Calliphora axata*'s distribution highlights its role in the species' habitat, which may be influenced by local climate, vegetation, or human activity patterns. This information is critical for entomological research, forensic science, and environmental management in the region. Hefei's status as a distribution point for *Calliphora axata* underscores the interconnectedness of urban environments and wildlife ecosystems, particularly in rapidly developing areas of China. Further studies may explore how urbanization in Hefei impacts the population dynamics or behavior of this species.
