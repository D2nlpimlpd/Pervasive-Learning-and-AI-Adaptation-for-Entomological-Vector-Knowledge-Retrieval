It serves as the **type locality** for *Huangshan guest night fly* (黄山客夜蝇), a species first described and documented in this region, highlighting its significance in entomological research. Additionally, the area is linked to *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, a species within the genus *Isomyia*, which is part of the family Muscidae. This connection underscores Huangshan’s role as a habitat for diverse fly populations, including those with specific ecological or taxonomic relevance.  \n\nFurther, the Huangshan region in Anhui Province is identified as a **distribution site** for two other fly species: *Zhejiang Meng Fly* (浙江孟蝇) and *Ring-spotted Meng Fly* (环斑孟蝇). These species, likely belonging to the same or related genera, contribute to the area’s biodiversity and ecological importance. The presence of these flies in the region suggests a complex interplay of environmental factors, such as altitude, climate, and vegetation, that support specialized insect communities.  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize different species, they collectively position Huangshan Mountain as a critical location for studying fly taxonomy and distribution in eastern China. The mountain’s unique ecosystem, characterized by its scenic landscapes and varied microhabitats, appears to foster the presence of both endemic and regionally significant species. The mention of \"\"type locality\"\" for *Huangshan guest night fly* and the distribution of *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Zhejiang Meng Fly*, and *Ring-spotted Meng Fly* in the area aligns with its reputation as a biodiversity hotspot.  \n\nNo contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as all consistently reference Anhui Province and associate the entity \"\"Huangshan\"\" with specific fly species.
