He is credited with describing numerous species, including *Mesembrina mystacea*, *Calliphora vomitoria* (commonly known as the Regurgitating Calliphora), *Stomoxys calcitrans*, *Haematobia irritans*, *Oestrus ovis*, *Hypoderma bovis*, *Oedemagena tarandi* (now *O. tarandi*), *Exorista larvarum*, *Tachina grossa*, *Hydrotaea meteorica*, *Delia radicum*, and *Fannia canicularis*. Linnaeus also established the *Musca* genus in 1758, designating *Musca pluvialis* (now *Fannia canicularis*) and *Musca caesar* (later renamed *Musca carnaria*, though the species *Sarcophaga carnaria* is not the original Linnaean one) as type species. Additionally, he described *Scathophaga stercoraria* and *Scathophaga scybalaria*, as well as *Musca domestica* (the common housefly). His work on domestic animal larvae in the USSR is highlighted, referencing species like *Hypoderma bovis* and *Oedemagena tarandi*. While some descriptions note his role in naming *叉叶绿蝇* (a species now classified under a different genus), the majority emphasize his 1758 publications as pivotal in formalizing taxonomic systems. Linnaeus’s legacy includes the binomial nomenclature framework, which remains central to modern taxonomy. The contradictions in the data—such as the distinction between *Musca carnaria* and *Sarcophaga carnaria*—are resolved by clarifying that Linnaeus originally described *Musca carnaria* in 1758, but the species *Sarcophaga carnaria* was later reclassified, retaining his nomenclature in some contexts.

This fly is notable for its ecological association with human-altered environments, particularly garbage and human food sources, which it frequents for feeding and breeding. The type locality for *Calliphora vomitoria* is Sweden, where it was originally identified and classified. Despite its specific origin, the species exhibits a widespread distribution, occurring across various regions beyond its native range. As a member of the Calliphoridae family, *Calliphora vomitoria* is part of a group of flies often recognized for their role in decomposition and forensic entomology. Its common name, \"\"Regurgitating Calliphora,\"\" may allude to behaviors such as regurgitating food to soften it, a trait observed in some blowfly species.

It serves as a key distribution area for several insect species, highlighting its biodiversity and ecological importance. Specifically, DEQIN is noted as the **mode locality** (the type locality where a species is first described) for the species *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, a taxonomic designation that underscores its role in entomological research. The county is also associated with the presence of *Mesembrina mystacea*, a species documented within its territory, and *Drymeia* species, which are found in the area as part of their broader distribution range. Additionally, DEQIN is linked to *Miltogramma bimaculatum*, further emphasizing its role as a habitat for diverse insect life. \n\nOne of the most specific ecological details about DEQIN is its high-altitude site at **3700 meters elevation**, where the species *Metopia yunnanica* has been recorded. This elevation data provides critical context for understanding the environmental conditions that support the species’ survival. While the descriptions do not specify whether the other species (*Mesembrina mystacea*, *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, *Drymeia*, and *Miltogramma bimaculatum*) are found at similar altitudes, they collectively establish DEQIN as a region of interest for studying insect biodiversity in Yunnan. \n\nThe repeated mention of DEQIN in relation to multiple species across different genera suggests it is a focal point for entomological studies in the province. Its inclusion as a distribution site for *Drymeia* species and the mode locality for *Polleniopsis deqingensis* indicates that the area may harbor unique microhabitats or ecological niches conducive to specialized insect populations. The presence of *Metopia yunnanica* at 3700 meters further highlights the county’s varied topography, which likely supports a range of ecosystems from lower to higher elevations. \n\nIn summary, DEQIN is a county in Yunnan, China, distinguished by its role as a habitat for several insect species, including *Mesembrina mystacea*, *Drymeia* species, *Miltogramma bimaculatum*, and *Metopia yunnanica* (specifically at 3700 meters elevation).

Additionally, YIBIN is home to *Yibin Fannia*, another species found in the region.

The city’s ecological or geographical features likely contribute to the presence and study of these species, though further details about their habitats or conservation status are not provided in the data. Both *Mesembrina mystacea* and *Yibin Fannia* are linked to YIBIN in scientific literature, with the former being definitively tied to the city as its type locality and the latter being documented as occurring there.
