While the specific details of these wing patterns are not elaborated in the provided data, they are highlighted as a defining trait of the species. \n\n**Musca tempestiva** is documented to inhabit multiple Chinese provinces, indicating a relatively broad distribution within the region. Its habitat preferences, though not explicitly detailed, are implied to be specialized, as the species is noted for its distinct ecological adaptations. The combination of its physical attributes and habitat specificity likely plays a role in its survival and behavior in diverse environments. \n\nThe species’ taxonomy and morphology have been studied since its initial description, with emphasis on the sexual dimorphism observed in its population. Such features are critical for accurate identification and classification within the family Muscidae. Despite its historical documentation, further research may be required to fully understand its ecological role, life cycle, and interactions within its range. \n\nIn summary, **Musca tempestiva** is a well-established fly species with a documented presence in China, distinguished by its dark bronze coloration, unique wing patterns, and morphological differences between sexes. Its adaptability to multiple provinces suggests a degree of environmental resilience, though its specific habitat requirements remain an area for potential investigation. The species serves as an example of the biodiversity and taxonomic richness of flies in East Asia. \n\n(Word count: 150)\",2\n2184,SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,Publication source for Musca tempestiva,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11650,NORTHEAST REGION,LIAONING,Liaoning province is located in the Northeast region of China,228\n3464,CHINESE HANDBOOK OF IMPORTANT MEDICAL ANIMALS,HEILONGJIANG,The handbook documents species distribution in Heilongjiang province,209\n3966,YUNNAN,NEOMYIA BRISTOCERCUS,Neomyia bristocercus is distributed in Yunnan,162\n3352,MESAMBRIANA INTERMEDIA,ZETTERSTEDT,Zetterstedt described Mesembrina intermedia in 1849,65\n7042,VILLENUEVE,NORTHERN CHINA,\"Tricycleopsis, established by Villeneuve, is reported in Northern China\",41\n7765,\"PROTACALLIPHORA AZUREA (FALLEN, 1816)\",CHINA,The species is distributed in China,38\n2,CHINA,SECOND EDITION,The second edition focuses on documenting fly species native to China,34\n59,CHINA,HEBEI MEDICAL COLLEGE,College is located in China,32\n3817,DASYPHORA APICOTAENIATA,NI,Ni described the species Dasyphora apicotaeniata in 1982,18\n3821,DASYPHORA TIANSHANENSIS,NI,Ni described the species Dasyphora tianshanensis in 1982,18\n3440,HAINAN MO YING,NI,Ni described the species Morellia hainanensis in 1982,17\n3829,DASYPHORA GANSUENSIS,NI,Ni described the species Dasyphora gansuensis in 1982,17\n3443,NI,MORELLIA SUIFENHENSIS,Ni described the species Morellia suifenhensis in 1982,16\n3420,绥芬河莫蝇,NI,Ni described the species 绥芬河莫蝇,15\n3459,NI,SUIFEN RIVER,\"Ni described the species Morellia suifenhensis, which has its type locality in Suifen River\",15\n3875,DASYPHORA QINGHAIENSIS,NI,Ni described the species Dasyphora qinghaiensis in 1982,15\n4061,NI,绯颜翠蝇NEOMYIA (ORTHELLIA) RUFIFACIES,Ni described the species 绯颜翠蝇 in 1982,15\n65,SHANGHAI INSTITUTE OF ENTOMOLOGY,PUBLICATION OF SECOND EDITION,Institute published and partially funded the second edition,8\n3357,MESAMBRIANA INTERMEDIA,MANAS,Mesembrina intermedia is distributed in Manas,8\n9358,SARCOPHAGA OSTINDICAE,SOUTHERN CHINA,Sarcophaga ostindicae is distributed in Southern China,8\n3353,MESAMBRIANA INTERMEDIA,DAIXIAN,Mesembrina intermedia is distributed in Daixian,7\n3354,MESAMBRIANA INTERMEDIA,HULUN RIVER,Mesembrina intermedia is distributed in Hulun River,7\n3356,MESAMBRIANA INTERMEDIA,CHABUCHAR,Mesembrina intermedia is distributed in Chabuchar,7\n3647,MUSCA TEMPESTIVA,SWEDISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,Musca tempestiva is documented in the Swedish Academy of Sciences publication,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
