Their work spans multiple decades, with notable publications from 1962 to 1988. Chao first described *Servillia planiforceps* in 1962 and *Chaetexorista palpis* in 1965, establishing an early focus on parasitoid fly taxonomy. In 1978, they co-described the subspecies *Leucomyia cinerea dukoica*, indicating collaboration in early taxonomic efforts.  \n\nBy 1986, Chao expanded their research to include *Carcelia lymantriae*, a species associated with the genus *Carcelia*. The 1988 period marks a significant output, with Chao co-authoring or describing numerous species. These include *Metopia pollenia* and *Metopia auripulvera*, as well as *Miltogramma bimaculatum* and *Miltogramma tibitum* in the *Zoological Journal*. They also described *Metopia yunnanica* and co-described *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus*, *Protomiltogramma yunnanicum*, and *Sarcophila mongolica* (with Agria *xiangchengensis* also co-described in 1988). Additionally, Chao contributed to the 1988 description of *Brachicoma nigra* and co-authored the classification of *Eumetopiella (Arabiopsis) mesomelaenae* and *Eumetopiella (Intermedia) luridimacula*.  \n\nChao’s work in 1988 further highlights their role in describing multiple species of *Senotainia*, including *Senotainia (Sphixapata) sinerea*, and co-describing *Crosskeya gigas* alongside Shima, as referenced in a figure (A44). Their expertise in Tachinidae is underscored by the diversity of genera they addressed, such as *Metopia*, *Miltogramma*, *Eumetopiella*, and *Crosskeya*. Collaborative efforts are evident in several entries, including co-authorship of *Sarcophila mongolica* and *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus*, as well as contributions to the *Zoological Journal* for *Miltogramma* and *Protomiltogramma* species.  \n\nChao’s career reflects a specialization in parasitoid flies, with a particular emphasis on morphological and taxonomic studies. Their descriptions often appear in scientific journals and are frequently co-authored, suggesting active participation in collaborative research. The breadth of their work, spanning genera like *Servillia*, *Chaetexorista*, *Carcelia*, *Metopia*, *Miltogramma*, *Eumetopiella*, *Crosskeya*, *Wohlfahrtiodes*, *Protomiltogramma*, and *Agria*, demonstrates a comprehensive engagement with Tachinidae systematics. Notably, their 1988 publications alone include over a dozen species, underscoring a pivotal year in their taxonomic contributions.  \n\nWhile some descriptions lack specific journal details (e.g., *Crosskeya gigas* in figure A44), the majority are tied to formal taxonomic works, including the *Zoological Journal*. Chao’s legacy is marked by meticulous documentation of species, often in partnership with other researchers, and their efforts have provided foundational classifications for parasitoid flies in regions such as China. Their work remains a critical reference in entomological literature, particularly for species within the genera and subspecies mentioned above.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",20\n4603,1971年在内蒙古农牧区土牧尔台的调查,\"Survey conducted in 1971 in Tumerte, Inner Mongolia, to study Sarcophila rasnitzyni\",2\n360,动物学集刊,\"\n\n动物学集刊 (Sinozoologia) 是一份中国动物学领域的学术期刊，自创刊以来持续发表昆虫分类与生态研究的重要成果。该期刊记录了多个新物种的首次描述，包括甲虫类的 *Metopia pollenia* 和 *Metopia auripulvera*，以及蝇类的 *Agria xiangchengensis* 和 *Sarcophila mongolica*。此外，期刊还详细报道了 *Miltogramma bimaculatum*、*Miltogramma rutilans*、*Miltogramma tibitum* 等物种，并首次提出其亚种 *Miltogramma ibericum brachygonitum* 的分类信息。在1991年，该期刊发表了关于长腹鬃粪蝇 (*Sepsis longicaudata*) 和角板鬃粪蝇 (*Sepsis corniculata*) 的研究，进一步丰富了中国双翅目昆虫的分类学资料。同时，渡口白麻蝇 (*Chrysomya putuoensis*) 的描述文献收录于第6卷289-290页，成为该期刊早期具有代表性的研究成果之一。这些发表的物种涵盖不同昆虫目类，体现了期刊在动物多样性研究中的广泛覆盖与学术价值。通过整合多篇文献，动物学集刊为昆虫学界提供了系统性的分类依据和生态数据，成为相关领域的重要参考资料。\",13\n4548,XIANGCHENG,\"\n\nXIANGCHENG is a high-altitude location in Sichuan Province, China, situated between 3,000 and 3,200 meters above sea level.

Additionally, XIANGCHENG is part of the distribution range for another species, *Metopia suifenhoensis*, indicating that the area supports the natural habitat of this species as well. The region’s elevation and ecological characteristics likely contribute to its role as a significant site for the study and documentation of these two *Metopia* species, which may share or differ in their adaptations to the local environment. While the descriptions highlight distinct taxonomic associations—*Metopia pollenia* being specifically tied to XIANGCHENG as its type locality and *Metopia suifenhoensis* as part of its broader distribution—the information collectively underscores the area’s importance in entomological research. No contradictions exist between the provided data, as the two species are distinct and their relationships to XIANGCHENG are complementary rather than conflicting.
