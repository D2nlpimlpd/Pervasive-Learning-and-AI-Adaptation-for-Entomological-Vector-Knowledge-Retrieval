The nation serves as a key distribution site for **Neomyia species**, a group of blowflies, and is specifically recognized as the **type locality** for the **Indian greenbottle fly** (*Neomyia vittina*), a species first described in this region. Additionally, **Sturmiopsis inferens**, a species of blowfly, is documented as being distributed in Bangladesh, further highlighting its ecological role in the area. The country also hosts **Myospila bina**, another fly species, as part of its broader biodiversity. These species, collectively, underscore Bangladesh’s significance in the study of dipteran fauna, particularly in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. The descriptions provided align in emphasizing Bangladesh’s role as a geographic hub for these species, with no contradictions noted in their distribution claims. The mention of \"\"type locality\"\" for the Indian greenbottle fly adds specificity, indicating that this species was first identified and classified in Bangladesh. Overall, the data collectively portray Bangladesh as a critical location for the presence and scientific documentation of these fly species, contributing to regional and global entomological research.\",4\n2312,FAUNA OF INDIA,\"\n\nThe **Fauna of India** is a comprehensive taxonomic reference series dedicated to documenting the biodiversity of animal species native to the Indian subcontinent. Initiated as a collaborative scientific endeavor, this publication series serves as a foundational resource for zoological research, conservation, and ecological studies in India. It systematically catalogs species through detailed descriptions, classifications, and illustrations, often incorporating contributions from entomologists, ichthyologists, and other specialists. The series is notable for its rigorous scientific approach, providing authoritative data on morphology, distribution, habitat, and taxonomy of Indian fauna.  \n\nAmong the species documented in the **Fauna of India** is *Dasyphora cyanicolor subsp.*, a subspecies included in the taxonomic framework to reflect its distinct characteristics within the broader *Dasyphora cyanicolor* species. The series also features *Myospila lasiophthalma*, a species described and formally recognized within its pages, highlighting the publication’s role in introducing new taxa to the scientific community. Additionally, the **Fauna of India** includes the Indian greenbottle fly (*Neomyia indica*), a common blowfly species, with detailed entries on its biology, ecological significance, and taxonomic placement. These examples underscore the series’ scope, which spans both well-known and less-studied organisms, from insects to vertebrates.  \n\nThe **Fauna of India** is organized into volumes, each focusing on specific taxonomic groups or regions, ensuring a structured and accessible format for researchers. It integrates historical records with contemporary findings, often revising classifications as new genetic or morphological data emerge. The inclusion of species like *Neomyia indica* and *Myospila lasiophthalma* demonstrates its utility in addressing both applied and theoretical aspects of zoology, such as forensic entomology (for blowflies) or ecological niche studies (for rare subspecies like *Dasyphora cyanicolor subsp.*).  \n\nWhile the descriptions provided emphasize different aspects—taxonomic documentation, publication of new species, and specific case studies—the **Fauna of India** functions as a unified, authoritative compendium. It bridges gaps in knowledge by consolidating regional biodiversity data, supporting conservation efforts, and serving as a baseline for future research. The series remains a critical tool for scientists, policymakers, and educators, ensuring the preservation and understanding of India’s rich faunal heritage.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",3\n2311,DASYPHORA CYANICOLOR,\"Dasyphora cyanicolor is a subspecies mentioned in the Fauna of India, Dipt.7, Muscidac(1): 144\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4081,JAPAN,NEOMYIA INDICA,The Indian greenbottle fly is distributed in Japan,237\n4087,BANGLADESH,NEOMYIA INDICA,The Indian greenbottle fly is distributed in Bangladesh (type locality),19\n4104,FAUNA OF INDIA,NEOMYIA INDICA,Fauna of India documents the Indian greenbottle fly,18\n3873,DASYPHORA CYANICOLOR,FAUNA OF INDIA,Fauna of India documents the subspecies Dasyphora cyanicolor,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
