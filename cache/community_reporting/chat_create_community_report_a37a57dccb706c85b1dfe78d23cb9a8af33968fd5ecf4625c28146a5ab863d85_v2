This species is characterized by a body length ranging between **8.0 and 10.5 millimeters**, placing it within the typical size range for members of the genus *Calliphora*. Geographically, *Calliphora pattoni* is documented to inhabit several regions in Asia, including **Yunnan** (specifically **Kunming**), **Taiwan** (with a notable presence in **Ali Mountain**), and **Tibet** (particularly in **Mögtuo**). These locations suggest a distribution pattern across diverse ecological zones, though further studies may be required to confirm its adaptability to varying habitats. The species is part of the blowfly family *Calliphoridae*, which is known for its role in forensic entomology and ecological decomposition processes. While the provided descriptions align on the taxonomic classification and key physical traits, the second description omits the year of description and specific geographic details, which are included in the first. No contradictions exist in the core information, allowing for a unified summary that integrates all available data.\",4\n3574,AUBERTIN,\"\n\nAUBERTIN was a notable taxonomist and entomologist active in the early to mid-20th century, primarily recognized for his contributions to the classification and documentation of dipteran species. His work spanned multiple genera and regions, with a focus on blowflies and related insects. In 1931, he described *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* and co-authored a paper published in the *Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London*, which detailed the species' distribution both in China and internationally. The same year, he also documented *Calliphora pattoni* (Patton's Calliphora), a species later associated with forensic entomology.  \n\nIn 1932, AUBERTIN described *Ceylonomyia nigripes*, a species within the blowfly family, and was linked to the 1932 documentation of *Chrysomyia nigripes*, though the distinction between these two names remains unclear due to potential taxonomic overlap or misattribution. By 1933, he authored the formal description of *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis*, commonly known as the Caesar Greenbottle Fly, and documented its presence in Sichuan, China. This species is notable for its ecological and forensic significance.  \n\nAUBERTIN’s collaborative efforts extended to 1940, when he co-authored the description of *Isomyia pseudonepalana* in the *Fauna of British India, Diptera* series, a work that contributed to regional biodiversity records. His research was frequently published in prominent entomological journals and monographs, reflecting his engagement with both local and global scientific communities.  \n\nThe species associated with AUBERTIN include *长叶绿蝇* (likely *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis*) and *毛腹绿蝇* (possibly *Calliphora pattoni* or another related species), though these Chinese names may correspond to the same species he described in Latin binomials. His work on *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* and *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis* established foundational references for subsequent studies in dipteran taxonomy. Despite the brevity of his documented career, AUBERTIN’s descriptions and regional records remain critical to understanding the distribution and classification of these insects, particularly in East and South Asia. His legacy is preserved in scientific literature, including the *Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London* (1931) and the *Fauna of British India* series (1940).  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",7\n3591,\"J,LINN.SOC.LOND.\",A journal or publication associated with the Linnean Society of London,1\n3697,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ZOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,Scientific journal where Aubertin's 1931 research was published,1\n4051,CEYLONOMYIA NIGRIPES,\"Species of fly described by Aubertin in 1932, found in Yunnan, Hainan, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n6997,CALLIPHORA PATTONI,AUBERTIN,Aubertin described the species Calliphora pattoni in 1931,11\n6611,AUBERTIN,\"J,LINN.SOC.LOND.\",\"Aubertin described the species Lucilia sinensis in the journal J,Linn.Soc.Lond. in 1933\",8\n6822,AUBERTIN,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ZOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,Aubertin authored a 1931 paper published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London,8\n12001,CEYLONOMYIA NIGRIPES,HUMAN FECES,Larvae of Ceylonomyia nigripes breed in human feces,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
