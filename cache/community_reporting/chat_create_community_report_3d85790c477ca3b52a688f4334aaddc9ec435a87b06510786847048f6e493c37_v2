Zool.*) is a Swedish scientific journal that has served as a platform for the description and documentation of various zoological species. Established as a key publication in the field of zoology, it has been referenced in the taxonomic work of entomologists and other researchers. Notably, the journal was used by Swedish entomologist **Sven Ringdahl** in 1930 to describe the species *Coenosia griseiventris*, a fly within the family Muscidae. Additionally, *Arkiv för Zoologi* is cited in the description of another species, *Acklandia subgrisea*, further underscoring its role in the formal classification of zoological taxa. The journal’s Swedish origin and its historical use in species descriptions highlight its significance in the scientific community, particularly for studies related to invertebrates and biodiversity. Its full title and abbreviation are consistently associated with contributions to zoological taxonomy, ensuring clarity in academic references. The journal remains a reliable source for zoological research, with its publications contributing to the understanding of species morphology, distribution, and ecological roles. By consolidating these details, *Arkiv för Zoologi* is recognized as a foundational resource in Swedish zoological studies, with documented examples of its use in describing both *Coenosia griseiventris* and *Acklandia subgrisea*. \n\n(Word count: 150)\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n653,RINGDAHL,ACKLANDIA SUBGRISEA,Ringdahl described Acklandia subgrisea,55\n663,ARKIV FÖR ZOLOGI,ACKLANDIA SUBGRISEA,Acklandia subgrisea was described in Arkiv för Zoologi,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
