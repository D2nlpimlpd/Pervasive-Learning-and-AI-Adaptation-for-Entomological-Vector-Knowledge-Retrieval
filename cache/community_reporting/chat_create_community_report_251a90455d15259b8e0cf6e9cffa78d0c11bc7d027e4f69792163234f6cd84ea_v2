In 1912, he described several species, including *Sarcophaga calicifera*, which was later synonymized with *Pierretia (s.str.) villeneuvei*. The same year, he also documented the species *1340杯细麻蝇* (likely a Chinese name for a fly species) and *台南细麻蝇* (another Chinese name, possibly for a distinct species). Additionally, in 1912, he described *PIERRETIACAUDAGALLI* and the *1354 Tail Pierretia Fly*, both of which appear to belong to the genus *Pierretia* or a related group. Notably, *Sarcophaga calicifera* was later reclassified as the type species of the genus *Ascelotella*, indicating its foundational role in defining that taxonomic group.  \n\nIn 1913, BOETCHER expanded his work by describing *Sarcophaga orchidea* and *Seniorwhitea phoenicoptera*, further demonstrating his expertise in the Sarcophagidae family (flesh flies). His 1912 descriptions of *Pierretia* species, including *PIERRETIACAUDAGALLI* and the *1354 Tail Pierretia Fly*, suggest a focus on morphological or ecological distinctions within this genus, though the exact relationships between these species remain unclear due to limited contextual details. The Chinese names *1340杯细麻蝇* and *台南细麻蝇* likely correspond to additional species he identified, though their formal Latin binomials are not explicitly provided in the data.  \n\nBOETCHER’s work reflects a broader effort to catalog and systematize fly species during a period of active taxonomic research. The reclassification of *Sarcophaga calicifera* as the type species of *Ascelotella* highlights the dynamic nature of taxonomic science, where initial classifications may be revised as new data emerges. While some of his described species, such as *Sarcophaga orchidea* and *Seniorwhitea phoenicoptera*, remain in their original genera, others, like *Sarcophaga calicifera*, have undergone nomenclatural changes. The inclusion of Chinese names in the data underscores the regional focus of his studies, particularly in areas where local terminology was used to identify species.  \n\nDespite the lack of explicit resolution for all taxonomic relationships, the synthesis of these descriptions establishes BOETCHER as a key figure in early 20th-century entomology, with a particular emphasis on the Sarcophagidae family and the genus *Pierretia*. His contributions laid groundwork for subsequent revisions and classifications, illustrating the collaborative and evolving nature of biological taxonomy. The contradictions in the data—such as the dual reclassification of *Sarcophaga calicifera* as both a *Pierretia* synonym and the type species of *Ascelotella*—are resolved by acknowledging the chronological progression of taxonomic decisions, where initial placements may later be adjusted based on phylogenetic or morphological evidence.  \n\nIn summary, BOETCHER described multiple fly species between 1912 and 1913, including *Sarcophaga calicifera* (1912, later *Ascelotella calicifera*), *Sarcophaga orchidea* (1913), *Seniorwhitea phoenicoptera* (1913), and several others with Chinese names (*1340杯细麻蝇*, *台南细麻蝇*). His work on *Pierretia* species, such as *PIERRETIACAUDAGALLI* and the *1354 Tail Pierretia Fly*, further solidifies his role in advancing the understanding of this group. These contributions, though subject to later revisions, remain a critical part of entomological history.\",6\n5061,PIERRETIA (S.STR.)
