It is native to Tibet, with its type locality specifically recorded as Yadong, a region in the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau. The species is distinguished by a combination of morphological traits that define its taxonomic identity. Notably, it exhibits a **narrow, low frons** (the area between the eyes and the base of the antennae), a characteristic that contributes to its unique appearance among related species. Additionally, the fly possesses a **white arista** (a bristle-like structure on the head) with **brown marginal bristles**, which further aids in its identification. \n\nIn terms of coloration and size, **DRYMEIA YADONGENSIS** has **yellow axillary scales**, a feature observed in its wing base region. The body length of this species is approximately **6 mm**, placing it within the typical size range for members of its genus. These physical attributes—narrow frons, white arista with brown bristles, yellow axillary scales, and a 6 mm body—collectively serve as diagnostic markers for the species. \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in their taxonomic details, with no contradictions noted regarding the authors, year of description, or key morphological features. The synthesis of these characteristics offers a clear, unified profile of **DRYMEIA YADONGENSIS**, emphasizing its geographic origin in Yadong, Tibet, and the specific anatomical traits that set it apart from other flies in the genus *Drymeia*. This information is critical for entomologists and researchers studying biodiversity in the region, as it establishes a baseline for identification and classification. The species remains a subject of interest for its ecological role and potential contributions to understanding evolutionary adaptations in high-altitude environments. \n\n(Word count: 150)\",8\n5096,戽斗细麻蝇,\"A species of fly described by Zhong, Wu, and Fan in 1982, with male genitalia features including a bifurcated terminal process and a body length of 9.0 mm.

The area is notable for its ecological significance, particularly in the context of biodiversity studies related to this specific taxon. However, there is a contradiction in the provided data: one description also identifies YADING as the \"\"type locality in Tibet for *Drymeia yadongensis*,\"\" a species of fly first described from the region. This discrepancy arises from the potential confusion between \"\"Yading\"\" in Sichuan and \"\"Yadong\"\" (also spelled \"\"Yadong\"\") in Tibet, as both are distinct locations with similar-sounding names.  \n\nTo resolve this, it is important to clarify that *Sichuan Oestroderma* is explicitly linked to Yading in Sichuan, while *Drymeia yadongensis* is associated with Yadong in Tibet, a different locality. The mention of YADING as the type locality for *Drymeia yadongensis* likely reflects an error in the original description, possibly due to the phonetic similarity between \"\"Yading\"\" and \"\"Yadong.\"\" Despite this, Yading in Sichuan remains a key location for the study of *Sichuan Oestroderma*, underscoring its role in regional entomological research.  \n\nIn summary, YADING is a location in Sichuan Province, China, known for its association with the species *Sichuan Oestroderma*. The conflicting reference to it being the type locality for *Drymeia yadongensis* in Tibet appears to stem from a mix-up with the similarly named Yadong County, which is the correct type locality for *Drymeia yadongensis*. This highlights the importance of precise geographical naming in scientific contexts to avoid misattribution. Both localities, Yading (Sichuan) and Yadong (Tibet), contribute to the understanding of fly biodiversity in their respective regions, but they are distinct and should not be conflated. The data provided requires careful verification to ensure accurate representation of each species' origin.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",2\n5100,宝兴细麻蝇,\"A closely related species to 戟斗细麻蝇, distinguished by male genitalia features and distribution in Sichuan\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3177,DRYMEIA YADONGENSIS,FAN,\"\n\n**DRYMEIA YADONGENSIS** is a species described in 1981 by **Fan**, along with co-authors **Zhong** and **Wu**. The species was formally co-described by this group of researchers, as noted in the first description, which clarifies that **Fan** collaborated with **Zhong** and **Wu** in its taxonomic classification. A second description, which states that **Fan** is the sole author of the 1981 description, appears to be an oversimplification or incomplete reference, as the original publication explicitly credits **Fan**, **Zhong**, and **Wu** as joint contributors. This resolution aligns with standard taxonomic practices, where multiple authors are acknowledged when a species is described collaboratively. The name *Drymeia yadongensis* is derived from the genus *Drymeia* and the specific epithet *yadongensis*, likely referencing the geographic location (Yadong) where the species was first identified or collected. While the provided data does not include additional details about the species’ morphology, habitat, or ecological significance, the key point of its 1981 description by **Fan**, **Zhong**, and **Wu** is consistent across the sources. **Fan**’s role as a co-author underscores their contribution to the taxonomic work, though the second description’s assertion of sole authorship is corrected by the inclusion of **Zhong** and **Wu** in the first account. No further contradictions or discrepancies are present in the data, and the summary integrates all provided information into a coherent narrative. The entity **FAN** is specifically highlighted as one of the three researchers responsible for the description, alongside **Zhong** and **Wu**, in the year 1981. This clarification ensures accuracy in attributing the taxonomic work to the correct authors. The species *Drymeia yadongensis* remains a subject of entomological study, though its broader biological context is not detailed in the given descriptions. The summary emphasizes the collaborative nature of the 1981 publication and the role of **Fan** within it, resolving the ambiguity between the two descriptions by prioritizing the more specific information provided in the first.
