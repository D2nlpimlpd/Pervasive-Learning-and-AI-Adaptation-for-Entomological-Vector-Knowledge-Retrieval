It serves as the **type locality** for two distinct species: *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum* and *Paraprosalpia billbergi shanghaina*. A type locality is the specific location where a species is first identified, described, and formally named, making SONGJIANG SHESHAN a critical reference point for these taxa in scientific classification. \n\nThe first description highlights SONGJIANG SHESHAN as the designated type locality for *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum*, a species within the genus *Lucilia*, which is part of the blowfly family (Calliphoridae). The inclusion of the subgenus *Bufolucilia* in the species name suggests a taxonomic classification that may reflect morphological or genetic distinctions within the broader *Lucilia* group. The second description identifies the same area as the type locality for *Paraprosalpia billbergi shanghaina*, a subspecies of *Paraprosalpia billbergi*, a species of fly in the family Tachinidae. This dual designation underscores the region’s ecological or geographical relevance to the study and documentation of these insect species. \n\nWhile the two descriptions reference different species, they are not contradictory but complementary, as SONGJIANG SHESHAN appears to have been a site of multiple taxonomic discoveries. The area’s role in defining these species likely stems from its biodiversity or specific environmental conditions that facilitated their initial observation and classification. The use of the same locality for both a blowfly and a tachinid fly indicates that the region has been a focal point for entomologists studying various insect groups. \n\nSONGJIANG SHESHAN’s importance in scientific literature is tied to its association with these type localities, which provide foundational data for understanding the distribution, ecology, and evolutionary history of the species. As a type locality, it is permanently linked to the formal descriptions of *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum* and *Paraprosalpia billbergi shanghaina*, ensuring its role in future taxonomic comparisons and revisions. The area’s designation reflects the historical context of entomological research in Shanghai, a region known for its diverse ecosystems and ongoing contributions to the study of arthropod biodiversity. \n\nIn summary, SONGJIANG SHESHAN is a key location in Shanghai, China, where two insect species—*Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum* and *Paraprosalpia billbergi shanghaina*—were first described. Its dual status as a type locality for these species highlights its significance in entomology and serves as a permanent anchor for their scientific classification.
