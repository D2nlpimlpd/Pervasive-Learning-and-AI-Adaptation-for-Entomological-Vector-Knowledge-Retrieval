First described by the French entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863, the genus is characterized by a distinctive flat occiput (the posterior part of the head) adorned with black bristles, a key morphological trait used for identification. BESSA species are primarily native to China, where they are most commonly encountered, but their distribution extends to other regions, including Europe, Siberia, and Japan. This geographic range suggests a degree of adaptability to diverse temperate and boreal climates. As members of the Exoristini tribe, BESSA flies likely exhibit ecological roles typical of tachinids, such as regulating populations of insect hosts through parasitism. The combination of their unique anatomical features and broad distribution highlights their significance in both taxonomic studies and ecological contexts. The genus remains a subject of interest for entomologists due to its morphological distinctiveness and the potential for further research into its life history, host interactions, and biogeographic patterns.

It serves as a domestic distribution location for numerous insect species, including both flies and parasitic wasps. Among the notable species recorded in Guangxi are *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca convexifrons* (found in Guilin and Yushan), and *Musca crassirostris* (with records in Guilin Yanshan and Yangshuo). The region is also home to *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Argyrophylax phoeda*, *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*, and *Carcelia matsukarehae*, *Carcelia ambigua*, *Carcelia lymantriae*, as well as *Carcelia kockiana*. \n\nGuangxi hosts several species of the genus *Parasarcophaga*, including *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Parasarcophaga idmais*, *Parasarcophaga hui*, and *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*. Additionally, the region is a habitat for *Servillia planiforceps*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Heteronychia quoi*, *Bengalia* species, *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, *Dichaetomyia* species, *Lispe loewi*, *Stomorhina obsoleta*, *Austrophorocera*, *Caiusa coomani*, *Nemoraea pellucida*, *Cuphocera varia*, *Miltogramma iberium*, *Dolichocolon klapperichi*, and *Anthomyia illocata*. Specific localities within Guangxi, such as Nanning and Wuzhou, are highlighted for the presence of *Chrysomya pinguis*, *Chrysomya megacephala*, and *Chrysomya bezziana*. \n\nThe region is further associated with the distribution of *Stomoxys sitiens*, *Medina collaris*, *Gonia chinensis*, *Neomyia* species, *Vibrissina Rondani* genus, *Bessa* genus, *Achoetandrus rufifacies* (at Guilin Yanshan), *Hemipyrellia liguriens* (in Yangshuo), and *Actia nigroscutellata*. Chinese names for species include 紫翠蝇 (a species of fly), 翼阳细麻蝇, 1430筒须新怯寄蝇, and 1393义乌亚麻蝇, 1399胡氏亚麻蝇, alongside the genus *Hengda Jiewei Jiying* (recorded in Longsheng) and *Sisyropa prominens* (also found with *Drino inconspicua*). \n\nGuangxi’s biodiversity is underscored by its inclusion of *Lydella grisescens*, *I. euidielloides*, and *Lydella* species, as well as the genus *Lydella* and *Miltogramma iberium*. The region’s cities, such as Baise, Chongzuo, and Lingye, are noted for their ecological significance in supporting these species. While some descriptions refer to Guangxi as a \"\"province,\"\" it is technically an autonomous region within China, a distinction that aligns with its administrative classification.
