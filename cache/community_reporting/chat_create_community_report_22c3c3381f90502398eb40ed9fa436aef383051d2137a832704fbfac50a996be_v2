The following year, in 1965, the same journal was used by Grunin to describe *Oestroderma schubini*, another species within the field of insect taxonomy. These publications highlight the journal’s role as a platform for taxonomic research, particularly in documenting new or revised species of insects. While the descriptions of the two species are separated by a year, both are attributed to Grunin’s work, underscoring his contributions to entomological science during this period. The journal’s Russian title, *Энтомологическое обозрение*, translates to \"\"Entomological Review,\"\" suggesting its function as a scholarly periodical dedicated to the study of insects. The absence of conflicting information in the provided data allows for a coherent summary, emphasizing the journal’s historical significance in housing Grunin’s taxonomic findings.
