It includes the genera *Rhynchomydaea*, *Brontaea*, *Dichaetomyia*, and *Helina*, which are grouped under this taxonomic classification. The subfamily is distinguished by specific anatomical features, such as the presence of three abdominal notopleural bristles arranged in an equilateral triangle, a broad ovipositor in females, and unique wing and antennal structures. These traits help differentiate Phaoniinae from other subfamilies within the Muscidae family. While the first description emphasizes the inclusion of particular genera, the second highlights the subfamily’s taxonomic placement and defining characteristics. Together, they establish Phaoniina as a well-defined group within the broader context of fly taxonomy, with both phylogenetic and morphological significance. The summary integrates all provided details without contradiction, ensuring a cohesive overview of the entity.\",9\n1555,PHAONIA,\"\n\n**Phaonia** is a genus of flies belonging to the subfamily Phaoniinae within the family Muscidae. It is characterized by distinct morphological features that aid in its taxonomic differentiation, including a **Phaonia-type lower surstylus** and the presence of a **proximal anterior bristle on the mesepisternum**. These traits are critical for distinguishing *Phaonia* from closely related genera, such as *Limnophora*, which is also discussed in comparative studies. The genus is often referenced in entomological literature alongside *Limnophora* to highlight variations in anatomical structures, particularly those related to the male terminalia and thoracic bristle patterns. *Phaonia* species are typically associated with ecological niches involving decomposition or detritus, as is common among many muscid flies. The subfamily Phaoniinae, to which *Phaonia* belongs, is part of the larger family Muscidae, which includes a diverse array of flies with significant roles in forensic science, ecology, and agriculture. While the provided descriptions do not explicitly detail the specific differences between *Phaonia* and *Limnophora*, the emphasis on the lower surstylus and mesepisternal bristle suggests these are key diagnostic markers in their classification. Further studies comparing these genera may explore additional morphological or genetic distinctions to refine their taxonomic placement. Overall, *Phaonia* serves as an important example of the taxonomic complexity within the Phaoniinae subfamily, with its unique features contributing to the broader understanding of muscid fly evolution and systematics.\",8\n2937,DICHAEATOMYIA,\"\n\n**Dichaetomyia** is a genus of flies within the subfamily Phaoniinae, which is part of the tribe Phaoniini.
