The Hengduan Mountains, a mountain range in southwestern China spanning Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces, host a rich array of insect species, many of which are endemic or understudied. Two notable studies have contributed to the documentation of this fauna. The first, published in a journal, describes two species of the genus *Phaonia*—*Phaonia mimobasiseta* and *Phaonia caudilata*—in volume 2, page 1237. These species, likely blowflies (family Calliphoridae), are part of the broader research into the region's dipteran diversity, which plays critical roles in ecosystems as decomposers, pollinators, and food sources. The second study focuses on *Drymeia* species, a genus within the family Muscidae, and documents their presence in the same provinces (Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai). This publication highlights the taxonomic and ecological significance of *Drymeia* in the Hengduan Mountains, emphasizing the area's role as a hotspot for muscid fly diversity. Together, these works underscore the importance of the Hengduan Mountains as a key region for entomological research, where both *Phaonia* and *Drymeia* species contribute to the understanding of local insect communities. The studies also reflect the fragmented yet growing body of knowledge about the area's insects, with each publication addressing distinct genera and geographic subsets. While the first study provides specific taxonomic details for *Phaonia* species, the second expands the scope to *Drymeia*, illustrating the range of dipteran adaptations in the region's varied habitats. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they reference separate species and publications. Collectively, they reinforce the Hengduan Mountains' status as a vital area for conserving and studying insect biodiversity, with ongoing research continuing to uncover new species and ecological relationships. These findings are essential for informing conservation strategies and understanding the impacts of environmental changes on fragile alpine and subtropical ecosystems.\",5\n704,YUNNAN,\"\n\nYunnan, a Chinese province (云南) renowned for its rich biodiversity, is a key region for the distribution of numerous fly species and genera. The province hosts documented populations of **Mesembrina** species, as well as **Argyrophylax laticornis**, **Atherigona reversura**, **Atherigona oryzae**, and **Atherigona yiwulushan**. It is also home to **Iranihindia spinosa**, **Metopia auripulvera**, **Musca convexifrons** (found in Kunming and Xishuangbanna), **Musca malaisei**, **Musca craggi**, **Musca seniorwhitei**, **Phryxe vulgaris**, and **Pogonomyia** species in areas like Deqin and Weixi. Specific localities such as Lijiang Dayanzhen serve as the type locality for **FAN'S SARCOPHAGA**, while **Kanomyia bangkokensis** and **Meliniella spatuliforceps** (type locality in Ruili Mengxiu) are also recorded there.  \n\nYunnan’s diverse ecosystems support multiple **Isomyia** species, including **I. divisa**, **I. mandarina**, and **I. tripartita**, as well as **Servillia planiforceps** and **Periscepsia carbonaria**. The province is notable for its **Chrysomya** species, such as **Chrysomya pinguis**, **Chrysomya megacephala**, and **Chrysomya bezziana**, distributed across cities like Lufeng, Shiping, Dali, Kunming, and Xishuangbanna. **Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis** and **Sarcorohdendorfia seniorwhitei** are also present, with the latter’s type locality in Yongshan.  \n\nAdditional species documented in Yunnan include **Calliphora axata** (Zhongxun), **Calliphora rohdendorfi**, **Calliphora chinghaiensis** (Zhongdian), **Graphomya rufitibia** (Xishuangbanna), **Paradichosia scutellata**, **Polietes orientalis** (Deqin), **Sturmiopsis inferens**, **Syngamoptera jirisanensis**, and **Xenotachina pulchellifrons**. The province is a domestic distribution site for **Adia**, **Metoposisyrops scirpophagae**, **Muscina** (specifically in Kunming), **Vibrissina Rondani**, **Haematobia**, **Neomyia** species (Mengding, Gengma, Dushu Jiao, Mengla), and **Sarcosolomonia** species.  \n\nYunnan’s southern regions, such as the Nujiang River Valley, are associated with **Metopia suifenhoensis** and **Metopia yunnanica**, while **Drymeia midtibia** and **Drymeia grapsopoda** are found in the province. The genus **Periscepsia** is present in Yunnan, alongside **Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri** (Xishuangbanna) and **Bercaea cruentata**. **Bellardia curviloba**, **Bellardia micromenechma**, and **Bellardia notomenechma** are documented in Kunming and other areas.  \n\nNotable localities within Yunnan include **Lugu Hu** (Kunming) for **Bellardia** species, **Jianshui** for **Brontaea hirtifemorata** (Jizushan in Bichuan), and **Lancang** and **Xishuangbanna** for **Achoetandrus rufifacies**. The province is also home to **Kangding Variant Beauty Fly Paradichosia kangdingensis**, **Xanthotryxus uniapicalis**, **Delia bracata**, **Drino facialis**, and **Phaonia dianierrans** (type locality).  \n\nYunnan’s ecological significance is further underscored by its role as a domestic distribution site for **Carcelia matsukarehae**, **Carcelia ambigua**, **Carcelia kockiana** (hosting *Heliothis armigera*), **Parasarcophaga brevicornis**, **Parasarcophaga macroauriculata**, and **Gymnadichosia pusilla**.

The region is also associated with **Musca malaisei** and **Musca seniorwhitei**, as well as the Chinese species **611扁蹠芒蝇** (likely *Atherigona sp.*) and **612黄髭芒蝇** (*Atherigona sp.*). Additionally, Xishuangbanna is the type locality for three *Isomyia* species: **Isomyia sagittalis**, **Isomyia quadrina**, and **Isomyia verirecta**, and it hosts **Isomyia isomyia** and **Isomyia viridaurea** as part of their broader distribution.  \n\nThe area is notable for the presence of **Achoetandrus rufifacies**, a species linked to its ecological context in Yunnan. Xishuangbanna is also a distribution site for **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly** (*Pierretia caudagalli*), **1340杯细麻蝇** (*Musca sp.*), and **Ceylonomyia nigripes**. It is explicitly mentioned as the domestic and foreign distribution site for **云南亚麻蝇** (Yunnan Atherigona fly), with the Chinese name **中国云南西双版纳** (Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China) cited as its type locality. The region further supports **Sarcorohdendorfia inextricata** and **Hypopygiopsis infumata**, the latter of which is specifically noted to include the sub-region **Daminglong** within Xishuangbanna.  \n\nXishuangbanna’s ecological importance is underscored by its role as a habitat for these diverse species, many of which are endemic or have limited geographic ranges. The descriptions consistently identify it as part of Yunnan Province, with some specifying it as a \"\"sublocation\"\" in broader distribution contexts. While terms like \"\"location,\"\" \"\"region,\"\" and \"\"city\"\" are used interchangeably in the data, Xishuangbanna is officially a prefecture-level city in Yunnan, encompassing both urban and rural areas. Its tropical and subtropical climate, along with rich ecosystems, likely contribute to the presence of such a wide array of fly species, including those with scientific names in both Latin and Chinese. The region’s status as a type locality for several species highlights its significance in entomological research.  \n\nIn summary, XISHUANGBANNA is a biodiverse hub in Yunnan, China, where multiple fly species—spanning genera like *Atherigona*, *Musca*, *Isomyia*, and others—are documented, with some having their type localities or primary distributions there. Key species include *Atherigona reversura*, *Musca malaisei*, *Isomyia sagittalis*, *Achoetandrus rufifacies*, and *Hypopygiopsis infumata*, among others, with sub-regions like Daminglong playing a role in specific distributions.
