His work spanned multiple taxonomic groups, including the genera *Emmesomyia* (established in 1917), *Dichaetomyia* (1921), *Xenotachina* (1921), *Rypellia* (1931), *Cephalispa* (1935), and *Lasiopelta* (1928). Malloch’s research was published in prominent entomological journals such as *Annals and Magazine of Natural History*, *Zoologische Anzeiger (Leipzig)*, and *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica*.  \n\nHe described numerous species across his career, including *Atherigona oryzae* (1925), *Atherigona tridens* (1928), *Atherigona simplex* (1925), *Atherigona atripalpis*, *Atherigona confusa*, and the Chinese-named species 黄足璃蝇 (*Isomyia cupreoviridis*) and 半透璃蝇 (*Isomyia pseudolucilia*). Malloch also documented *Haematostoma austeni* (1932), *Neomyia fletcheri* (1932), *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri* (1919), *Helina hirtifemorata* (1926), and *Dichaetomyia flavocaudata* (1928). His work on *Musca formosana*, the first description of the species in 1925, earned him recognition as the initial describer of the \"\"Taiwan housefly.\"\" Additionally, he contributed to the taxonomy of *Isomyia* with *Isomyia cupreoviridis* (1928) and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, as well as *Myospila flavibasis* (1925) and *Myospila femorata* (1935).  \n\nMalloch’s studies extended to ecological observations, including research on fly larvae ecology in 1923 and 1929, and a 1927 study on the distribution of *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* in Sulawesi, Indonesia. He also authored a 1927 study on fly species and a 1930 study (specific details unspecified). Among his notable works are the descriptions of *Eutrichota labradorensis* (1920) and *Eutrichota magna* (year unspecified), as well as *Xenosia tarsalia* and *Xenosia scutellaris* (both 1935). He was cited for documenting *Thricops coquilletti* (1920) and *Haematobia australis* (1932), and for the species *Tainanina sarcophagoides* (1931) and *Bengalia (Eubengalia) emarginata* (1927).  \n\nHis publications included species such as *Chaetolispa* (1922) and *Xenolispa* (1923), and he described *Neohelina* in 1924. Malloch’s work on *Nupedia fulva* (1934) and *Hebecnema affinis* (1921) further highlights his focus on dipteran taxonomy. The Chinese-named species 毛股阳蝇 and 黑瓣莫蝇 were also attributed to him, though specific years for these are not provided.  \n\nMalloch’s legacy is marked by his meticulous documentation of fly species, genera, and ecological studies, with his research appearing in both Western and Chinese entomological literature. His contributions to the classification of *Scathophaga* species in 1935 and the establishment of *Emmesomyia* in 1917 underscore his influence in the field. Despite some entries listing overlapping or ambiguous details (e.g., multiple descriptions of *Atherigona* species or the genus *Cephalispa*), the core of his work remains a foundational resource for dipteran taxonomy. His career, spanning at least 1917 to 1935, reflects a dedicated effort to catalog and understand the diversity of flies, particularly in regions like Sulawesi and North America.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",53\n2314,RYPELLIA,\"A closely related genus to Pyrellia, described by Malloch, with distinct morphological features\",2\n2532,三齿芒蝇,\"A species of fly (Atherigona tridens Malloch, 1928) with H-shaped tail segments.

Morphologically, species in this genus are distinguished by a **slightly forward-projecting frons triangle**, a feature that contributes to their unique head structure. The **frons width** is approximately **1/5 of the head width**, emphasizing a relatively narrow central region of the head. Their **eyes** are notable for having a **height significantly greater than their length**, creating a vertically elongated appearance. Additionally, the **lower half of the eye is distinctly concave**, a characteristic that differentiates them from closely related genera. Beyond head features, CEPHALISPA is also recognized for **distinct wing features**, though specific details about these traits are not elaborated in the provided data. The combination of these head and wing characteristics solidifies their classification within the Coenosiini tribe, which is known for diverse and specialized morphological adaptations among fruit flies. This genus exemplifies the taxonomic complexity of the tribe, with its unique anatomical traits aiding in identification and ecological studies. The emphasis on eye and frons morphology aligns with broader patterns in tephritid flies, where such features often play roles in species recognition and behavior. While the descriptions focus on structural attributes, further research into their biology, distribution, or ecological interactions could enhance understanding of their evolutionary significance within the tribe.
