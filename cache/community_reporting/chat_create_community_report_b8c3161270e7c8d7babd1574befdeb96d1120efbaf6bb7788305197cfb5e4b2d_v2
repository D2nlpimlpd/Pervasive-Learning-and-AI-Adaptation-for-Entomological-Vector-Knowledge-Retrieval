The area is associated with the presence of **Lucilia hainanensis**, a blow fly species documented in the region. Additionally, **Guling** has been identified as a habitat for **Pyrellia cyanicolor** (环斑孟蝇), a species of the family Calliphoridae, which was recorded in the locality. The Chinese term \"\"环斑孟蝇\"\" directly corresponds to *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, emphasizing its ecological relevance in the Guling area. These findings highlight Guling's role in supporting diverse dipteran populations, particularly within the context of forensic entomology or biodiversity studies, where such species distributions are critical for understanding local ecosystems. The region’s inclusion in scientific records for both *Lucilia hainanensis* and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* underscores its importance as a reference point for entomological research in Jiangxi. No contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as all consistently identify Guling as part of Jiangxi Province and link it to the distribution of these two fly species.\",1\n4038,噶洛山,印度噶洛山（Garo Hills），环斑孟蝇的分布地,1\n4039,卡西山,印度卡西山（Khasi Hills），环斑孟蝇的分布地,1\n2031,天目山,\"\n\nTianmu Mountain (天目山) is a prominent geographical entity located in Zhejiang Province, China, renowned for its ecological significance and role as a biodiversity hotspot for various fly species. The mountain is explicitly associated with the distribution of multiple fly species, including *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, *疏斑纹蝇* (a species likely translated as \"\"sparse-spotted fly\"\"), and *浙江孟蝇* (Zhejiang *Musca* species, though the exact taxonomic classification may require further verification). These associations highlight Tianmu Mountain as a critical area for entomological research and conservation.  \n\nSpecifically, Tianmu Mountain serves as the **type locality** (模式产地) for *疏斑纹蝇* and *浙江孟蝇*, meaning these species were first identified and described based on specimens collected from this region. The presence of *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* further underscores the mountain’s ecological diversity, as these species are documented within its distribution range. The mention of \"\"multiple fly species distributions\"\" in the data suggests that Tianmu Mountain supports a broader array of fly populations, potentially due to its unique environmental conditions, such as altitude, climate, or vegetation.  \n\nZhejiang Province, where Tianmu Mountain is situated, is known for its rich biodiversity, and the mountain’s role in harboring these specific fly species contributes to its scientific importance. The combination of type localities and distribution records indicates that Tianmu Mountain is not only a site of origin for certain species but also a habitat where they thrive. This dual role may make it a focal point for studies on species evolution, ecological adaptation, and regional entomology.  \n\nNo contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions consistently identify Tianmu Mountain as a location in Zhejiang Province linked to fly species. The summary integrates the entity’s role as both a type locality and a distribution area, emphasizing its multifaceted significance in the context of these species. The mountain’s association with *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, *疏斑纹蝇*, and *浙江孟蝇* collectively establishes it as a key site for understanding fly biodiversity in the region.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",4\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n7591,环斑孟蝇,黄山,环斑孟蝇分布于安徽省黄山地区,17\n7595,环斑孟蝇,牯岭,环斑孟蝇分布于江西省牯岭地区,15\n7600,环斑孟蝇,噶洛山,环斑孟蝇分布于印度噶洛山,15\n7601,环斑孟蝇,卡西山,环斑孟蝇分布于印度卡西山,15\n3428,PYRELLIA CYANICOLOR,天目山,天目山 is a distribution area for Pyrellia cyanicolor,14\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
