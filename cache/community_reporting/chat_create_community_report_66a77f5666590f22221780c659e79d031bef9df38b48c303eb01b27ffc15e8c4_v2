It is associated with the distribution and biodiversity of various fly species, serving as a critical reference point in entomological studies. Specifically, Emei Mountain is the type locality for the Broad-angled Yang Fly (*宽角阳蝇*), *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Pan Ye Quan Zhong Ting* (盘叶泉种蝇), and *E Ze Ju Quan Zhong Ting* (峨泽菊泉种蝇), meaning these species were first described based on specimens collected there. The mountain is also linked to the presence of *Phorbia hypandrium* and *Pyrrellia cyanicolor*, which have been recorded in the region. Additionally, the species *Polietes hirticrura* is mentioned in the text as being associated with Emei Mountain, further underscoring its role as a hub for fly diversity. These associations highlight Emei Mountain’s ecological richness and its value as a site for scientific research on dipteran fauna. The mountain’s unique environment supports a range of species, some of which are endemic or have limited geographic distributions, making it a focal area for understanding regional biodiversity patterns. By consolidating these references, Emei Mountain emerges as a key location in Sichuan for both general fly species distribution studies and the specific typification of several notable fly species. Its prominence in entomological literature reflects the broader significance of Sichuan’s ecosystems in harboring diverse and specialized insect populations.\",5\n1235,盘叶泉种蝇,,4\n1234,峨泽菊泉种蝇,,5\n1236,泽菊泉种蝇,,3\n1226,金顶,金顶是峨眉山的地点，峨泽菊泉种蝇的模式产地。,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5551,宽角阳蝇,FANG,Fang is the author who described the species 宽角阳蝇,43\n1741,峨眉山,盘叶泉种蝇,峨眉山是盘叶泉种蝇的模式产地,9\n1749,峨泽菊泉种蝇,泽菊泉种蝇,峨泽菊泉种蝇与泽菊泉种蝇 (P. seneciella) 极近缘，但存在形态差异,8\n1748,青泽菊泉种蝇,泽菊泉种蝇,青泽菊泉种蝇与泽菊泉种蝇 (P. seneciella) 极近缘，但存在形态差异,7\n1751,盘叶泉种蝇,泽菊泉种蝇,盘叶泉种蝇与泽菊泉种蝇 (P. seneciella) 极近缘，但存在形态差异,7\n1743,金顶,峨泽菊泉种蝇,金顶是峨泽菊泉种蝇的模式产地,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
