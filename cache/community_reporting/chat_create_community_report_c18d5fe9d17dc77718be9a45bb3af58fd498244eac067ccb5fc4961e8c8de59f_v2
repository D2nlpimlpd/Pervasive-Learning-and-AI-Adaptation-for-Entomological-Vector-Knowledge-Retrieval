It serves as the **type locality** for the species *Syngamoptera chekiangensis*, a designation that appears in multiple descriptions, underscoring its role as the original location where this species was first identified and described. Additionally, the mountain is associated with two other species: **东方粪泉蝇** (*Chrysomya orientalis*) and **朔粪泉蝇** (*Chrysomya shuoana*), though the exact nature of this association (e.g., type locality, habitat, or distribution) is not explicitly clarified in the provided data. However, the repeated emphasis on \"\"type locality\"\" for *Syngamoptera chekiangensis* confirms its foundational importance in the taxonomic history of this species.  \n\nTianmu Mountain is also noted as a **distribution site** for *Silbomyia hoeneana*, a species of fly, indicating that it is one of the regions where this organism is naturally found. The mountain’s ecological significance is further highlighted by its role as a type locality for an unnamed \"\"new species\"\" referenced in the text, though the specific identity of this species remains unspecified. This suggests that Tianmu Mountain has been a focal point for the discovery and classification of multiple insect species, particularly within the genera *Syngamoptera* and *Chrysomya*.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Tianmu Mountain’s importance in entomology, particularly for species with Chinese geographic ties. While some details, such as the precise relationship between the mountain and *Chrysomya orientalis*/*Chrysomya shuoana*, are not fully elaborated, the mountain is consistently identified as a key location in Zhejiang Province for both the type locality of *Syngamoptera chekiangensis* and the habitat of *Silbomyia hoeneana*. Its role in supporting diverse fly populations and serving as a reference point for taxonomic studies positions it as a critical site for scientific research in the region.  \n\nIn summary, TIANMU MOUNTAIN is a biologically significant location in Zhejiang, China, linked to the type locality of *Syngamoptera chekiangensis*, the distribution of *Silbomyia hoeneana*, and the presence of *Chrysomya orientalis* and *Chrysomya shuoana*. It also hosts an unnamed new species, as noted in the text, further cementing its status as a hub for entomological discoveries. The mountain’s ecological and scientific relevance is reinforced by its repeated mention across descriptions, though additional context would clarify the full extent of its role in the life cycles or habitats of the associated species.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",4\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2426,朔粪泉蝇,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy originally described 朔粪泉蝇 in 1830,121\n2419,东方粪泉蝇,SUWA,Suwa described 东方粪泉蝇 in 1974,42\n2718,OUCHI,\"J, SHANGHAI SCI.
