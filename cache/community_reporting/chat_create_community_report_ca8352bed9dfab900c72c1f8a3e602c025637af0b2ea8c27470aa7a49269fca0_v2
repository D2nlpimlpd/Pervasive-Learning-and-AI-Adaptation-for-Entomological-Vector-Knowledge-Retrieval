It is characterized by distinct T-shaped black median stripes on the abdominal tergites, a feature that distinguishes it from other members of its genus. The fly also possesses a white alula, a small lobe on the hind leg, which further aids in identification. Morphologically, it has a body length of approximately 4 mm, as noted in taxonomic records. \n\nThe species is distributed in two primary regions: domestically in Shanxi Province, China, specifically in the city of Taiyuan, and internationally in the Alps of Europe, where it was first identified as the type locality. These geographic ranges suggest a possible adaptation to temperate and alpine environments, though specific ecological preferences remain undocumented in the provided data. \n\nBoth descriptions confirm the T-shaped black stripes on abdominal segments (tergites) and the presence of a white alula as defining traits. The first description adds the body length of 4 mm, while the second emphasizes the distribution in Shanxi and the Alps. No contradictions exist between the two sources, as they align on key morphological and geographic details. The summary integrates all provided information to present a cohesive overview of Leucophora dorsalis, highlighting its taxonomic history, physical features, and known habitats.\",8\n1627,FANNIA SIMILIS,\"A species of fly with a single pre-costal bristle, one pre-dorsal and post-dorsal bristle on the mesotibia, and a body length of 5.0 mm.

Characterized by features like a bare postoccipital area and forked anal lobe. Distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.\",4\n926,DELIA GRACILIS,\"\n\n**DELIA GRACILIS** is a species of fly within the genus *Delia*, first described by Stein in 1907. It is characterized by a slender rostrum, a morphological feature that distinguishes it from other members of the genus. The species also exhibits a non-forked terminal segment of the lateral tail plate, a key taxonomic trait noted in its classification. Delia gracilis has a body length of approximately 7.5 mm, placing it within the typical size range for flies in this genus. Geographically, it is known to inhabit Qinghai, China, specifically in the regions of Huangyuan and Bulhanbuda Mountain. These habitats likely reflect its ecological preferences, though further details on its behavior or life cycle are not provided in the descriptions. The combination of its slender rostrum, non-forked tail plate structure, and specific geographic distribution in Qinghai underscores its unique identification within the *Delia* genus. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, allowing for a unified summary that integrates all details.\",4\n1106,ENGYNEURA SETIGERA,\"Type species of the genus Engyneura, described by Stein in 1907\",4\n1241,扁狭泉种蝇,\"\n\n**扁狭泉种蝇** (Pegohylemyia depressa) is a species of fly within the genus *Pegohylemyia*, first described by Stein in 1907. It is characterized by a body length ranging from 4.5 to 6 mm, with a distinct morphological feature being a short and blunt anal plate terminal process, which differentiates it from the closely related *尖扁泉种蝇*. Additionally, *扁狭泉种蝇* lacks small projections on the lateral lobes of the anal plate, a trait that further distinguishes it from other species in the group. The type locality for this species is Qinghai, China, where it was originally identified. While one source notes its distribution as extending to Japan, Europe, and North America, another description emphasizes its primary association with Qinghai. This discrepancy may reflect regional records or taxonomic updates, but the species is definitively documented in Qinghai as its origin and core habitat. *扁狭泉种蝇* is part of the broader *Pegohylemyia* genus, which includes other species with similar ecological or morphological traits. Its classification and distinguishing features are critical for accurate identification within the group, particularly in differentiating it from *尖扁泉种蝇*. The species’ presence in multiple continents suggests a potential for wider dispersal, though further research may clarify its full geographic range. Morphologically, the combination of a short, blunt anal plate and the absence of lateral lobe projections provides a reliable diagnostic marker for entomologists. As a member of the *Pegohylemyia* genus, it contributes to the study of dipteran biodiversity and ecological adaptations in its habitats.\",4\n1250,三齿泉种蝇,,4\n1575,毛胫厕蝇,\"毛胫厕蝇 (Fannia ciliata Stein, 1895) is a species of fly described by Stein in 1895.

There is some discrepancy in the recorded date of its description, with sources citing either 1915 or 1928. This variation may arise from differing references to either the initial description or a subsequent revision of the species by Stein. Regardless of the specific year, Stein's work remains foundational in the classification of *Lasiopelta longicornis*, contributing to the understanding of its taxonomy and ecological characteristics. The species is notable for its elongated antennae, a feature reflected in its scientific name, which combines the genus *Lasiopelta* with the species epithet *longicornis*, meaning \"\"long-horned\"\" in Latin.
