Males are notable for their narrow foreheads and the presence of interfrontal bristles, while females exhibit distinct abdominal structures. A key diagnostic feature of the genus is the male fifth abdominal segment, which bears a single bristle on its anterior margin and plates with inner flaps, as described by Landia Hennig (1973) and Suwa (1974). Additionally, the anal tail leaf in Meliniella species often ends with an inward curl, further differentiating them from related genera. The genus is also characterized by the absence of certain bristles, such as those found in *Shakshainia* (Suwa) and *Craspedochoeta* (Macq.), and by narrower postabdominal side lobes compared to these genera. \n\nSpecies within *Meliniella* include *Meliniella sikisima* and *Meliniella griseifrons*, which exemplify the genus’s defining traits. The body length of these flies typically ranges from 4.5 to 9.0 mm, as noted in comparative studies. The male abdominal morphology is particularly critical for identification, with the fifth abdominal plates featuring inner flaps and side tail leaf inner branches, which are absent in the genera used for differentiation. These structural details, combined with the narrow postabdominal side lobes, provide a clear taxonomic basis for separating *Meliniella* from *Shakshainia* and *Craspedochoeta*. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize the importance of abdominal and bristle-related features in distinguishing *Meliniella* from closely related taxa. While the first description highlights the absence of specific bristles and narrower side lobes, the second and third descriptions elaborate on the male-specific traits, such as the single bristle on the fifth abdominal segment and the inward curling anal tail leaf. These features are consistent across the provided sources, with no direct contradictions. The references to Landia Hennig (1973) and Suwa (1974) underscore the historical context of the genus’s taxonomic classification. \n\nIn summary, *Meliniella* is a fly genus defined by male morphological traits including a narrow forehead, interfrontal bristles, a single bristle on the fifth abdominal segment, and abdominal plates with inner flaps and side tail leaf inner branches. The inward curling of the anal tail leaf and narrower postabdominal side lobes further distinguish it from *Shakshainia* and *Craspedochoeta*. With species like *M. sikisima* and *M. griseifrons*, the genus is well-characterized by its unique anatomical features and size range, making it a distinct group within the fly family.\",10\n695,MELINIELLA SIKISIMA,\"The type species of the genus Meliniella, described by Suwa in 1974.

MATS.** (short for *Insecta Mats*) is an entomological journal recognized for its contributions to the study of insect taxonomy and systematics. The publication has served as a platform for describing and documenting new genera and species within the insect order Diptera (true flies). Notably, it is the journal where Japanese entomologist **Takumi Suwa** formally described the genus *Meliniella* in 1974, marking a significant addition to the classification of flies within the family Stratiomyidae (soldier flies). Additionally, *Insecta Mats* has featured detailed taxonomic work on the genus *Pegohylemyia*, a group of aquatic or semi-aquatic flies in the family Hylemyiidae, further establishing its role in advancing knowledge of lesser-known dipteran taxa. The journal’s focus on specialized entomological research highlights its importance in the scientific community for publishing rigorous, peer-reviewed studies on insect morphology, ecology, and evolutionary relationships. By consolidating descriptions of both *Meliniella* and *Pegohylemyia*, *Insecta Mats* underscores its commitment to documenting biodiversity and supporting taxonomic revisions in entomology. Its historical contributions, particularly Suwa’s 1974 work, remain foundational for subsequent research on these genera. The journal’s abbreviated form, **INS. MATS.**, is commonly used in citations and references to streamline academic discourse while maintaining clarity about its identity as a dedicated entomological publication. Through its publications, *Insecta Mats* has contributed to the broader understanding of insect classification, providing critical insights into the phylogeny and distribution of species within the Diptera order.\",2\n469,LANDIA HENNIG,\"Landia Hennig is a person associated with the genus Meliniella, described in 1973\",1\n470,MELINIELLA SUWA,Meliniella Suwa is a person who described the genus Meliniella in 1974,1\n706,SHAKSHAINIA SUWA,,1\n707,CRASPEDECHOETA MACQ,,1\n703,PYRENEES,\"\n\nThe **Pyrenees** is a prominent mountain range in Europe, forming a natural border between France and Spain, and extending into Andorra. It is recognized as a significant geographical and ecological region, serving as a type locality for several species. Specifically, the Pyrenees is the type locality for **Meliniella griseifrons**, a species first described in this area, and for **Delia interflua**, which is also associated with the region as its type locality. Additionally, the Pyrenees is linked to **Delia karasawana**, though the exact nature of this association (e.g., habitat, distribution) is not explicitly detailed in the provided data.  \n\nThe region is further noted as a distribution area for **Enneastigma**, a species whose presence in the Pyrenees is described as \"\"foreign.\"\" This term may imply that Enneastigma is not native to the Pyrenees or that its occurrence there is part of a broader, non-local distribution pattern within Europe. However, the data does not clarify whether this \"\"foreign\"\" designation refers to the species' origin or its ecological integration into the region. Regardless, the Pyrenees is explicitly identified as a site where Enneastigma is found, underscoring its role in the species' geographic range.  \n\nAs a type locality, the Pyrenees holds particular importance in taxonomy for **Meliniella griseifrons** and **Delia interflua**, meaning these species were first scientifically documented in this area. The mountain range’s unique ecosystems, likely shaped by its elevation and location, may contribute to the presence and diversity of such species. The inclusion of multiple species (Meliniella griseifrons, Delia interflua, Delia karasawana, and Enneastigma) in the descriptions highlights the Pyrenees’ ecological significance as a habitat or reference point for entomological and biological studies.  \n\nThe data does not present direct contradictions but requires synthesis to clarify relationships. For instance, while the Pyrenees is the type locality for Delia interflua, it is also described as a \"\"foreign distribution region\"\" for Enneastigma, suggesting the latter’s presence there is either non-native or part of a secondary range. This distinction is resolved by framing the Pyrenees as both a native habitat for some species (e.g., Delia interflua) and a distribution site for others (e.g., Enneastigma), depending on their ecological or taxonomic context.  \n\nIn summary, the **Pyrenees** is a European mountain range with dual roles: it serves as the type locality for **Meliniella griseifrons** and **Delia interflua**, anchoring their scientific classification, while also acting as a distribution region for **Enneastigma** and a habitat associated with **Delia karasawana**. These connections emphasize the Pyrenees’ importance in biodiversity and taxonomy, particularly for the species explicitly tied to its geography. The region’s ecological characteristics likely support the presence of these organisms, though further details on their interactions or conservation status are not provided in the data.\",4\n702,WUSULI SOUTHERN,\"A southern region of Wusuli, associated with the distribution of Meliniella griseifrons.>\",1\n698,MELINIELLA SPATULIFORCEPS,\"A species in the genus Meliniella, described by Fan et Chu in 1982.
