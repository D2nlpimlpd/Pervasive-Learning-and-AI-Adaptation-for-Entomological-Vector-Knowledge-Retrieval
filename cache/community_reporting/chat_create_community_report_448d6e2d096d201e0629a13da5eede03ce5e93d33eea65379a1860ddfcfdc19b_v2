It has served as a key publication platform for entomologists to describe and reference newly discovered or taxonomically significant species since at least the 1970s. The journal has been cited in multiple instances for its role in publishing detailed accounts of various insect taxa, including species from the genera *Polleniopsis*, *Paradichosia*, *Melinda*, and *Sarcosolomonia*.  \n\nAmong the species documented in *Pacific Insects* are *Polleniopsis yunnanensis* and *Polleniopsis fukienensis*, which were published in the journal as part of its contributions to the taxonomy of the *Polleniopsis* genus. Additionally, *Paradichosia vanemdeni* was first described in the journal in 1970, marking an early example of its role in formalizing new species. The same year, *Melinda maai* (Kurahashi, 1970) was also first described in *Pacific Insects*, with the authorship and year of description attributed to Kurahashi. This species, like *Paradichosia vanemdeni*, highlights the journal’s historical significance in the 1970s for advancing knowledge of insect biodiversity.  \n\nFurther, *Sarcosolomonia harinasutai* was referenced in *Pacific Insects* in 1977, indicating the journal’s continued activity in documenting new or notable insect species over time. The inclusion of these species across different years and genera suggests that *Pacific Insects* has a broad scope, covering diverse insect groups and geographic regions within the Pacific. Its role as a repository for taxonomic work is reinforced by the fact that multiple species have been formally described or cited in its pages, contributing to the scientific community’s understanding of entomological diversity.  \n\nThe journal’s name and content imply a regional focus on Pacific-area insects, though the specific examples provided span different taxonomic contexts and publication dates.

The **Ussuri Border** is recognized as a distribution site for the species *Robineauella scoparia*, a type of fly belonging to the family Syrphidae, which is often associated with specific environmental conditions in temperate regions. Additionally, the same region is home to the genus *Sarcorohdendorfia*, a group of organisms (likely plants or invertebrates, depending on taxonomic context) that are also documented in the USSR's Far East. While the two descriptions highlight different species or genera, they collectively underscore the **Ussuri Border** as a biologically relevant area within the Soviet Union's eastern territories, where these distinct taxa are found. The region’s ecological characteristics, such as its temperate climate and proximity to the Ussuri River, may contribute to the presence of these species, though further details on their specific roles or interactions in the ecosystem are not provided in the data. The use of \"\"Ussuri Border\"\" in both contexts appears consistent, referring to the same geographical boundary, and the summary integrates the information to reflect its association with both *Robineauella scoparia* and *Sarcorohdendorfia*.

Additionally, SHAOWU is part of the distribution range for *Musca crassirostris*, another species within the same family, highlighting its ecological relevance in the region. Most notably, SHAOWU serves as the **type locality** for *Melinda maai* Kurahashi, 1970, a species described by the entomologist Kurahashi in 1970, underscoring its importance in the formal classification and scientific documentation of this particular organism. These associations collectively emphasize SHAOWU’s role in biodiversity research and its contribution to the understanding of fly species in Fujian, China. The city’s inclusion in the distribution of *Musca crassirostris* and its connection to *Atherigona reversura* further illustrate its value as a focal area for studying insect populations and their habitats. As the type locality for *Melinda maai*, SHAOWU is the specific site where the original specimens of this species were collected and described, making it a critical location for taxonomic reference. The descriptions provided are consistent in identifying SHAOWU as a city in Fujian, China, with no contradictions to resolve. Its repeated mention in relation to these species confirms its established status in scientific literature as a key location for entomological studies. The integration of all three references into a single summary ensures a comprehensive overview of SHAOWU’s ecological and taxonomic significance.\",1\n5861,PALM,Author of Voria spinicosta (1876) in the Systematic Description of European Two-winged Insects,1\n5862,D'AGUILAR,Author of Voria ciliata (1957) in the Systematic Description of European Two-winged Insects,1\n5841,MACQUARTIINI,\"\n\nMACQUARTIINI is a tribe within the Tachinidae family of flies, specifically classified under the subfamily Tachininae. It is characterized by distinct morphological features, including the presence of black bristles on the posterior region of the head, an elongated scutellum (a triangular plate on the thorax), and unique patterns of bristles on the thorax and abdomen. These traits help differentiate MACQUARTIINI from other tribes within the Tachininae subfamily. The tribe is notable for encompassing the genus *Macquartia*, which is a key representative of the group. *Macquartia* species, like other members of MACQUARTIINI, are typically parasitoid flies that play ecological roles in regulating insect populations. The combination of the tribe’s taxonomic placement, morphological markers, and inclusion of *Macquartia* provides a cohesive framework for identifying and studying its members. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align in defining MACQUARTIINI as a Tachininae tribe with specific anatomical traits and a focus on the genus *Macquartia*.

Baranov, a taxonomist, is credited with both the formal description of the genus and its creation as a taxonomic entity during that year. The name \"\"Sarcosolomonia\"\" reflects its classification within the broader field of biological taxonomy, though specific details about its species, characteristics, or ecological significance are not provided in the given data. The connection between the two entities is clear: Baranov's work in 1938 directly led to the recognition of Sarcosolomonia as a distinct genus.

Baranov, a notable taxonomist, described and classified the genus as part of his scientific contributions, providing the foundational characteristics and nomenclature that define *Protonemoraea*. The establishment of this genus in 1935 marks its official recognition within the taxonomic framework, with Baranov's work serving as the authoritative reference for subsequent studies. While the descriptions provided do not elaborate on the specific biological or ecological traits of *Protonemoraea*, they collectively emphasize Baranov's role in its creation and documentation. The genus remains a subject of interest in taxonomic research, with its classification and attributes rooted in Baranov's early 20th-century work. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as both align in attributing the genus's establishment to Baranov in 1935.
