It is associated with the distribution of *Fannia similis*, a species within the family Muscidae, which has been observed in the region as part of its natural habitat. Additionally, Ying County serves as the type locality for *Ph. mimofausta* (likely *Phaonia mimofausta*, a species in the family Muscidae), meaning it is the geographic origin where this species was first identified and described by taxonomists. The county is also noted as a location in Shanxi where *Helina latitarsis*, a member of the family Sarcophagidae, is distributed, further highlighting its role in the biodiversity of these insect groups. Together, these associations underscore Ying County's importance as a site for entomological research, particularly in understanding the ecological ranges and taxonomic origins of these species. The region's inclusion in scientific records for *Fannia similis*, *Ph. mimofausta*, and *Helina latitarsis* reflects its contribution to the broader study of fly populations in China.
