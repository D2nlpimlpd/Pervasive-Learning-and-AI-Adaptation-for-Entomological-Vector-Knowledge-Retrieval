Their contributions span several decades, beginning in 1913 when they co-described *Musca bezzii* in the *Ind.Journ,Med.Res.* journal and *Musca gibsoni*. By 1929, Patton had expanded their research to include studies on antenna forms in flies, a specialized focus within entomology. In 1932, they contributed to the description of *Musca crassirostris*, and in 1933, they co-described *Musca greeni*. Their work in 1937 included the identification of *Musca planiceps var. formosana*, a subspecies of the *planiceps* variant.  \n\nPatton is also credited with describing or co-describing several other *Musca* species, including *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, and *Musca fletcheri*. Notably, they were involved in resolving taxonomic complexities for *Musca autumnalis*, describing multiple synonyms such as *Musca prashadi*. Additionally, their work extended to *Musca domestica* (the common housefly) and *Musca sorbens*, though the exact nature of their contribution to these species is noted as either description or illustration.  \n\nThe breadth of Patton’s work highlights their role in advancing the classification and understanding of fly morphology, particularly in the early 20th century. Their collaborations and publications in journals like *Ind.Journ,Med.Res.* underscore their significance in the field of medical and systematic entomology. While specific institutional affiliations or full biographical details are not provided in the descriptions, the repeated association with *Musca* species and their 1929 research on antennae suggest a specialized expertise in dipteran taxonomy and anatomy.  \n\nPatton’s legacy includes foundational contributions to the nomenclature and characterization of these species, with their work cited in both species descriptions and comparative studies. The inclusion of synonyms and subspecies in their research indicates a meticulous approach to taxonomic accuracy, addressing potential overlaps or misclassifications in the literature. Their 1937 description of *Musca planiceps var. formosana* further demonstrates their engagement with regional biodiversity, particularly in Asia.  \n\nIn summary, PATTON is recognized as a key figure in the taxonomic study of *Musca* species, with documented contributions to the description of at least 10 distinct species or subspecies, including *Musca bezzii*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca prashadi*, *Musca crassirostris*, *Musca planiceps var. formosana*, *Musca gibsoni*, *Musca greeni*, *Musca fletcheri*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, and *Musca autumnalis*. Their 1929 work on antenna forms and their role in resolving synonyms for *Musca autumnalis* further solidify their impact on entomological science. The descriptions collectively paint a picture of a dedicated researcher whose work bridged morphological analysis and taxonomic classification, leaving a lasting imprint on the study of flies.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",36\n2200,MUSCA CRAGGI PATTON,\"A species of fly described by Patton in 1922, associated with blood-feeding behavior and found in regions like Yunnan and Hainan\",4\n171,CREATION OF FIGURE A13,\"The creation of figure A13 depicting the antenna of Glossina tachinoides, based on the 1929 work of Patton and Evans\",2\n2176,MUSCA PLANICEPS VAR.

Its presence in Kagoshima aligns with its broader ecological adaptability across temperate and tropical regions. Meanwhile, *Musca sorbens*, or the stable fly, is a blood-feeding pest typically found in agricultural and livestock areas, known for its impact on animal health and productivity. The stable fly’s distribution in Kagoshima suggests the region may have environments conducive to its lifecycle, such as proximity to grazing lands or organic waste sources. \n\nWhile both descriptions highlight Kagoshima’s role in the geographic spread of these species, they refer to separate biological contexts. *Musca conducens* is more generalist in habitat selection, whereas *Musca sorbens* thrives in specific conditions tied to animal husbandry. The coexistence of these species in Kagoshima underscores the city’s ecological diversity and potential as a hub for entomological study. No contradictions exist between the provided data, as the two species are distinct in their biology and habitat preferences.
