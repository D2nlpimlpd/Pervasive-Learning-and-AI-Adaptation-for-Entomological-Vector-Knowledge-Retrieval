It is distributed in Beijing, Gansu, Shanghai (according to literature), Zhejiang, Taiwan (according to literature), and Tibet in China, and in Indonesia abroad. Its known host in China is the walnut leafroller Locastra muscosalis Walker.\",8\n727,INDONESIA,\"\n\nIndonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago, is a significant region for the distribution of numerous fly species across its diverse islands and ecosystems. The country is associated with the presence of **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Pygophora respondens**, and **Pectiniseta pectinata**, which are documented in its territories. Additionally, **Musca convexifrons**, **Thecocarcelia parnarae**, **Argyrophylax phoeda**, and **Argyrophylax nigrotibialis** are found in Indonesia, alongside the **LUTEIVENTRIS** and **APICALIS DICHAETOMYIA** species of *Dichaetomyia*. The Chinese name **紫翠蝇** (likely referring to a specific species) is also recorded as occurring in the country.  \n\nIndonesia serves as an international distribution location for **Limnophora prominens** and **Limnophora albitarsis**, with the latter explicitly noted in the Malay Peninsula. The archipelago includes key regions such as **Java**, **Sumatra**, **Kalimantan**, **Lombok**, **Flores**, and the **Nusa Tenggara Islands**, which are type localities or sub-regions for several species. For example, **Dichaetomyia quadrata** is type-localized in Java, while **Ophyra chalcogaster** is found in Java as its type locality. **Hemipyrellia liguriens** is distributed in Java, Sulawesi, and other islands, and **Chlororhinia exempta** is specifically recorded in Kalimantan. **Helina hirtifemorata** and **Helina nudifemorata** are distributed in Lombok, Flores, and Sumatra, with the latter having Lombok and Flores as its type locality.  \n\nThe country is also linked to the **Bengalia** species, **Borbororhina bivittata**, **Caricea boops**, **Cosmina limbipennis**, **Lispe loewi**, **Lispe sinica**, **Myospila argentata**, **Lasiopelta** species, **Sturmiopsis inferens**, and **Tainanina sarcophagoides**. Notably, **Sarcorohdendorfia seniorwhitei** is distributed in Java, and **Sarcorohdendorfia inextricata** has international distribution records. The **Indian greenbottle fly** and **Winthemia** genus are also present in Indonesia.  \n\nIndonesia is highlighted as a foreign distribution location for certain species, such as **Musca crassirostris** and **Carcelia kockiana**, as well as **Chaetexorista javana**. The **Stomorhina** genus is mentioned as occurring in Indonesia, though it is described as a \"\"foreign location\"\" in some contexts. The **Neomyia** species are found in Sumatra and the Nusa Tenggara Islands, while **Hypopygiopsis infumata** is recorded in Java. **Ophyra chalcogaster** is type-localized in Java, and **Chrysomya bezziana** is distributed in the Oriental region with Indonesia as its type locality.  \n\nThe **Dichaetomyia** genus is internationally distributed in Indonesia, with type localities in Sumatra, Java, and Kalimantan. The **Lasiopelta** and **Lasiopelta** species are grouped with **Myospila argentata** in the country. **Anthomyia illocata** and **Aphi** (potentially related to *Atherigona orbicularis* as a geographic subspecies) are also documented. The **species I. divisa** and **I. mandarina** are found in Indonesia, as are the **Borbororhina bivittata** and **Pales carbonata** (炭黑栉寄蝇).  \n\nIn summary, Indonesia is a critical hub for fly biodiversity, hosting a wide array of species across its islands. Its role as a type locality for several species, such as *Dichaetomyia quadrata* and *Ophyra chalcogaster*, underscores its importance in entomological taxonomy. The country’s distribution records span both native and foreign species, reflecting its ecological diversity and connectivity to broader biogeographic regions. Key islands like Java, Sumatra, Lombok, and Kalimantan are repeatedly cited as sub-regions for specific species, emphasizing localized hotspots of fly activity. This synthesis integrates all provided data, resolving minor contradictions by prioritizing explicit regional details and consolidating repeated mentions of species and locations.\",52\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3744,毛瓣家蝇,TAIWAN,台湾省是毛瓣家蝇的国内分布区域,130\n11067,炭黑栉寄蝇PALES CARBONATA,BEIJING,炭黑栉寄蝇Pales carbonata is distributed in Beijing,105\n3733,INDONESIA,毛瓣家蝇,印度尼西亚是毛瓣家蝇的模式产地,67\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
