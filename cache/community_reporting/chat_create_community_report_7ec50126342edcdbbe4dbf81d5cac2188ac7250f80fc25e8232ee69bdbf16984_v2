It is notable for the presence of several fly species, such as *Chrysomya rufifacies* (毛尾绿蝇), *Blaesoxipha grylloctona*, *Exorista xanthaspis*, *Oestrus ovis* (紫鼻狂蝇), *Protocalliphora azurea*, *Sarcophila rasnitzyni*, and *Cuterebra leporina* (兔裸皮蝇). The Mesembrina genus is also reported to be distributed in Mongolia, alongside the *Chrysomya* genus (斑麻蝇属). Additionally, the country serves as a foreign distribution area for species like *Sarcophila cheni* (陈氏污蝇), *Sarcophila intermedius* (介污蝇), and *Sarcophila yasui* (亚西污蝇), which are not native to the region but have been recorded there. Mongolia is further associated with *Gasterophilus pecorum*, a species of botfly, and *Ph,chalchica Zinovjev* (possibly a misspelling or shorthand for *Phormia chalchica* Zinovjev), though the latter’s taxonomic clarity may require verification. The repeated mention of *Oestrus ovis* (紫鼻狂蝇) and *Sarcophila rasnitzyni* underscores their significance in the region. These species span multiple ecological niches, reflecting Mongolia’s varied habitats, from arid steppes to alpine zones. The data collectively highlights Mongolia as a key location for studying the geographic range and ecological adaptability of these insects, particularly those with transcontinental distributions.
