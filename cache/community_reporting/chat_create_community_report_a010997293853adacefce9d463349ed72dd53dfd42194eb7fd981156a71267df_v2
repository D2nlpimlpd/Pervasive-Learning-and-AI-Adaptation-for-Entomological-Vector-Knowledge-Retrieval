His work spanned multiple taxonomic groups, with descriptions published between 1911 and 1933. In 1911, Villeneuve described the genus *Microceromasia* and the species *Blaesoxipha litoralis*. The same year also marked his involvement in the taxonomy of *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, a species later reclassified under the subgenus *Bufolucilia*. In 1925, he formally described the species *Atherigona reversura*, adding to the understanding of flies in the family Muscidae. By 1927, Villeneuve established the genus *Gymnadichosia*, which he expanded in 1933 with the description of the species *Gymnadichosia pusilla*. Additionally, he is credited as the author of the species *Hoplocephala linearis* and the genus *Wohlfahrtiodes*, though the exact year for these contributions is unspecified in the provided data. Villeneuve’s work reflects a focus on dipteran insects, particularly in defining new genera and species, and his publications remain foundational in entomological taxonomy. His career highlights include pioneering descriptions that clarified the relationships and classifications of these taxa, contributing to the broader field of insect systematics. The consistency in his naming conventions and the chronological progression of his publications suggest a dedicated and methodical approach to taxonomic research. Villeneuve’s legacy is preserved in the scientific literature through the species and genera he established, which continue to be referenced in modern entomology.\",14\n3997,DEXOPOLLENIA MACULATA,\"Species of fly described by Villeneuve in 1933, found in Sichuan\",2\n4696,\"DEUTS,ENT.ZEITS.\",\"\n\n**Deuts,ent.Zeits.**, the abbreviated form of *Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift*, is a German entomology journal. It is recognized as the publication where the species *Blaesoxipha litoralis* was first described in 1911. The journal serves as a key resource for entomological research and has contributed to the documentation of various insect species through its scholarly articles. The use of the abbreviation \"\"Deuts,ent.Zeits.\"\" is common in scientific literature to reference this periodical efficiently. The specific mention of 1911 in the second description aligns with the first, confirming the year of the initial description of *Blaesoxipha litoralis* in this journal. Together, these details establish *Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift* as both the authoritative German journal in entomology and the historical source for the taxonomic introduction of *Blaesoxipha litoralis*.
