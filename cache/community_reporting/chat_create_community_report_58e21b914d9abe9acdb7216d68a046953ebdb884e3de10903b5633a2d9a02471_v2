It is characterized by distinct morphological features that set it apart within the tribe, though the specific traits are typically detailed in taxonomic literature. The genus includes notable species such as *Catapicephala splendens*, which is part of its documented biodiversity. Geographically, Catapicephala is primarily found in the Oriental region, a biogeographic area encompassing South and Southeast Asia, where it contributes to the ecological and taxonomic diversity of dipteran insects. The combination of its classification within the Catapicephalini tribe, its defining physical attributes, and its regional distribution underscores the genus’s role in studies of fly evolution and biogeography. While the first description emphasizes its taxonomic placement and regional occurrence, the second highlights its morphological uniqueness, both of which are essential to understanding its biological significance. The genus remains a subject of interest for entomologists due to its specialized adaptations and ecological niche in the Oriental region.\",3\n2277,DASYPHORA ALBOFASCIA,\"A species of fly with 2 pairs of prealar bristles and a dark longitudinal stripe on the scutellum, found in Inner Mongolia (China)\",2\n5478,EXORISTA AURICEPS,,2\n4285,DIPT.EXOT.,Journal where Cosmina limbipennis was described by Macquart in 1848,1\n4402,SENOTAINIA RUBRIVENTRIS,\"The type species of the Senotainia genus, described by Macquart in 1846, with a dark, non-glossy body and abdominal markings\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n786,WIEDEMANN,DIPT.
