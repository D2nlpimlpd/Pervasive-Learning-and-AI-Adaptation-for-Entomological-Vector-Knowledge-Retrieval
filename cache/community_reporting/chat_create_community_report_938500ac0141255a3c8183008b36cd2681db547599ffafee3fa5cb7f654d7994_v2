It is taxonomically classified under *Eutrichota*, which is part of the family Tachinidae, a group of parasitoid flies. The subgenus is characterized by distinct morphological features, including straight and slender lateral lobes, which are prominent structures in the insect’s anatomy, and the presence of short setae (bristles) on the terminalia, the posterior segment of the body involved in reproduction and excretion. These traits help differentiate *Arctopegomyia* from other subgenera within *Eutrichota*. The name \"\"Arctopegomyia\"\" likely reflects specific taxonomic or etymological significance, though further details on its derivation are not provided in the descriptions. As a subgenus, it represents a subgroup within *Eutrichota*, contributing to the diversity and classification of tachinid flies. The work of Ringdahl in 1938 established this subgenus, emphasizing its unique anatomical attributes as key identifiers in entomological studies. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the subgenus’s classification, describer, and defining characteristics. This summary consolidates the available information to present a clear, unified overview of *Arctopegomyia* as a taxonomic entity.\",2\n1401,EUTRICHOTA (ARCTOPEGOMYIA),A subgenus of Eutrichota described by Ringdahl in 1938,2\n506,EUTRICHOTA,\"\n\n**EUTRICHOTA** is a genus of flies that has been the subject of taxonomic study in entomological literature. The genus was originally described by **Kowarz in 1893**, as noted in one of the sources, though another description attributes its formal classification to **Ringdahl in 1938**, specifically for the subgenus **Arctopegomyia**. This discrepancy may reflect differing historical perspectives or revisions in the classification of the group. The genus is characterized by **robust male genitalia** and distinct **setae patterns** (hairs or bristles on the body), which are key morphological features used to distinguish it from related genera.  \n\nEUTRICHOTA includes **multiple subgenera**, with **Pegomyza**, **Parapegomyia**, and **Arctopegomyia** explicitly named in the descriptions. The subgenus **Arctopegomyia**, described by Ringdahl in 1938, is a notable subdivision within the genus. The broader taxonomic framework of EUTRICHOTA encompasses a diverse array of species, as highlighted in general entomological references, though specific species names are not provided in the data. The genus is part of the family **Pegomyidae**, a group of flies commonly known as root-maggot flies, though this family-level classification is inferred from context rather than explicitly stated in the descriptions.  \n\nThe taxonomic history of EUTRICHOTA appears to involve contributions from multiple researchers. While Kowarz established the genus in 1893, subsequent work by Ringdahl in 1938 expanded its classification by introducing the subgenus Arctopegomyia. The inclusion of additional subgenera (Pegomyza and Parapegomyia) in later descriptions suggests ongoing refinement of the genus’s structure. Morphological traits such as the robust male genitalia and setae patterns are emphasized as diagnostic features, likely aiding in species identification and phylogenetic analysis.  \n\nIn summary, **EUTRICHOTA** is a fly genus with a complex taxonomic history, originally described by Kowarz in 1893 and later subdivided into subgenera like Arctopegomyia by Ringdahl in 1938. It is distinguished by robust male genitalia and unique setae arrangements, and its classification includes at least three subgenera: Pegomyza, Parapegomyia, and Arctopegomyia. The genus is recognized for its diversity, with numerous species documented in entomological studies, though further details on individual species remain unspecified in the provided data. The resolution of the authorship conflict (Kowarz vs. Ringdahl) aligns with the principle of priority in taxonomy, where the earliest valid description (Kowarz, 1893) takes precedence, while subsequent contributions (e.g., Ringdahl’s subgenus) are acknowledged as part of its evolving classification.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",11\n508,PEGOMYZA,\"Pegomyza is a subgenus of Eutrichota described by Schnabl in 1911, identified by forked terminalia and long, feathered arista\",1\n1398,\"EUTRICHOTA (S, STR.)\",A subgenus of Eutrichota characterized by specific morphological traits,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n424,ARCTOPEGOMYIA,RINGDAHL,Ringdahl described the subgenus Arctopegomyia of Eutrichota in 1938,54\n2148,RINGDAHL,EUTRICHOTA (ARCTOPEGOMYIA),Ringdahl described the subgenus Arctopegomyia in 1938,54\n420,EUTRICHOTA,PEGOMYZA,Pegomyza is a subgenus of Eutrichota,12\n2158,EUTRICHOTA,\"EUTRICHOTA (S, STR.)\",\"Eutrichota (s, str.) is a subgenus within the Eutrichota genus\",12\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
