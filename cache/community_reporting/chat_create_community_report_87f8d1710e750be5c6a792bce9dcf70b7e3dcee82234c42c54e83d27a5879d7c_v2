The country is associated with the presence of **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Pygophora respondens**, and **Pectiniseta pectinata**, which are documented in its territories. Additionally, **Musca convexifrons**, **Thecocarcelia parnarae**, **Argyrophylax phoeda**, and **Argyrophylax nigrotibialis** are found in Indonesia, alongside the **LUTEIVENTRIS** and **APICALIS DICHAETOMYIA** species of *Dichaetomyia*. The Chinese name **紫翠蝇** (likely referring to a specific species) is also recorded as occurring in the country.  \n\nIndonesia serves as an international distribution location for **Limnophora prominens** and **Limnophora albitarsis**, with the latter explicitly noted in the Malay Peninsula. The archipelago includes key regions such as **Java**, **Sumatra**, **Kalimantan**, **Lombok**, **Flores**, and the **Nusa Tenggara Islands**, which are type localities or sub-regions for several species. For example, **Dichaetomyia quadrata** is type-localized in Java, while **Ophyra chalcogaster** is found in Java as its type locality. **Hemipyrellia liguriens** is distributed in Java, Sulawesi, and other islands, and **Chlororhinia exempta** is specifically recorded in Kalimantan. **Helina hirtifemorata** and **Helina nudifemorata** are distributed in Lombok, Flores, and Sumatra, with the latter having Lombok and Flores as its type locality.  \n\nThe country is also linked to the **Bengalia** species, **Borbororhina bivittata**, **Caricea boops**, **Cosmina limbipennis**, **Lispe loewi**, **Lispe sinica**, **Myospila argentata**, **Lasiopelta** species, **Sturmiopsis inferens**, and **Tainanina sarcophagoides**. Notably, **Sarcorohdendorfia seniorwhitei** is distributed in Java, and **Sarcorohdendorfia inextricata** has international distribution records. The **Indian greenbottle fly** and **Winthemia** genus are also present in Indonesia.  \n\nIndonesia is highlighted as a foreign distribution location for certain species, such as **Musca crassirostris** and **Carcelia kockiana**, as well as **Chaetexorista javana**. The **Stomorhina** genus is mentioned as occurring in Indonesia, though it is described as a \"\"foreign location\"\" in some contexts. The **Neomyia** species are found in Sumatra and the Nusa Tenggara Islands, while **Hypopygiopsis infumata** is recorded in Java. **Ophyra chalcogaster** is type-localized in Java, and **Chrysomya bezziana** is distributed in the Oriental region with Indonesia as its type locality.  \n\nThe **Dichaetomyia** genus is internationally distributed in Indonesia, with type localities in Sumatra, Java, and Kalimantan. The **Lasiopelta** and **Lasiopelta** species are grouped with **Myospila argentata** in the country. **Anthomyia illocata** and **Aphi** (potentially related to *Atherigona orbicularis* as a geographic subspecies) are also documented. The **species I. divisa** and **I. mandarina** are found in Indonesia, as are the **Borbororhina bivittata** and **Pales carbonata** (炭黑栉寄蝇).  \n\nIn summary, Indonesia is a critical hub for fly biodiversity, hosting a wide array of species across its islands. Its role as a type locality for several species, such as *Dichaetomyia quadrata* and *Ophyra chalcogaster*, underscores its importance in entomological taxonomy. The country’s distribution records span both native and foreign species, reflecting its ecological diversity and connectivity to broader biogeographic regions. Key islands like Java, Sumatra, Lombok, and Kalimantan are repeatedly cited as sub-regions for specific species, emphasizing localized hotspots of fly activity. This synthesis integrates all provided data, resolving minor contradictions by prioritizing explicit regional details and consolidating repeated mentions of species and locations.\",52\n512,PHILIPPINES,\"\n\nThe Philippines, a Southeast Asian archipelago comprising over 7,000 islands, is a country renowned for its rich biodiversity and serves as a key distribution site for numerous fly species. It is home to a wide array of dipteran fauna, including *Pygophora respondens* and *Pectiniseta pectinata*, as well as *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, and *Musca seniorwhitei*. The APICALIS and FLAVOCAUDATA *Dichaetomyia* species are also documented there, with Luzon Island noted as the type locality for *Dichaetomyia quadrata*. Additionally, the Philippines hosts *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, the Star Island Greenbottle Fly, *Anthomyia illocata*, *Anthomyia plumiseta*, and the Indian greenbottle fly (*Chrysomya megacephala*), though the latter’s common name may imply regional overlap.  \n\nThe country supports species such as *Bengalia* (genus-level mention), *Borbororhina bivittata*, and *Borbororhinia bivittata*, which are often associated with its tropical ecosystems. *Helina hirtifemorata* and *Hemipyrellia liguriens* are further examples, with Luzon Island identified as the type locality for the former. *Rhyncomya setipyga*, *Strongyloneura prasina*, and *Tainanina pilisquama* and *Tainanina sarcophagoides* are also native to the region. The genus *Winthemia* and *Chlororhinia exempta* are present, while *Ophyra chalcogaster* and *Lixophaga parva* are naturally distributed there.  \n\nNotably, the Philippines is a foreign distribution record for certain species, such as *Musca crassirostris* and *Sarcosolomonia crinita*, indicating its role as an outlier in their global ranges. The Chinese-named species \"\"1340杯细麻蝇\"\" (likely *Musca cupripes*) and *Myospila flavibasis* are also reported, though the former’s inclusion may reflect regional taxonomic practices. The genus *Emmesomyia* is distributed across the archipelago, and Palawan, one of its islands, is highlighted as a distinct ecological zone.  \n\nThis summary consolidates the Philippines’ significance as a hub for diverse fly species, emphasizing both its native and foreign distribution records. The country’s unique geography, including Luzon and Palawan, contributes to the presence of type localities and specialized habitats for these insects. While some descriptions reference the Philippines as a \"\"foreign location,\"\" this likely pertains to species whose primary ranges lie elsewhere, underscoring the archipelago’s ecological connectivity and role in broader biogeographic patterns. The data collectively paint the Philippines as a critical region for studying dipteran diversity, with implications for taxonomy, conservation, and ecological research.\",35\n3021,DICHAEATOMYIA FEMORATA,,4\n3022,DICHAEATOMYIA PECTINIPES,,4\n3023,DICHAEATOMYIA PALLITARSIS,,4\n5696,炭黑栉寄蝇PALES CARBONATA,\"炭黑栉寄蝇Pales carbonata Mesnil, 1970 is a species of fly characterized by a black scutellum, no powder covering on the body (except possibly on the thorax and abdomen under light), and a body length of 8-11 mm.

Additionally, XIZANG is identified as the habitat of *Chlororhinia exempta* and *Paradichosia scutellata*, both of which are found within the Tibetan region. The data further specifies that XIZANG is part of the domestic regions associated with the Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing, indicating its relevance in parasitological research or studies conducted by the institution. While one description generically refers to \"\"the species\"\" being found in XIZANG, the specific examples provided clarify that this includes the aforementioned taxa. Collectively, the information underscores XIZANG's ecological and scientific importance as a region in China where these particular species are distributed and as a geographical reference in parasitic disease research.

It serves as a significant geographical and ecological entity within the country, characterized by its diverse ecosystems, including tropical rainforests, rivers, and wetlands. The island is notable for being a habitat for various species, including the *Chlororhinia exempta*, a species of dragonfly or damselfly (family Chlorocyphidae) that is specifically documented to occur in this region. While the first description broadly identifies Kalimantan as an Indonesian island where \"\"the species is found,\"\" the second provides the precise taxonomic name, *Chlororhinia exempta*, clarifying the specific organism associated with the location. Together, these descriptions highlight Kalimantan's role as both a geographical entity and a biodiversity hotspot, particularly for the *Chlororhinia exempta*. The island's unique environmental conditions, such as its freshwater systems and dense vegetation, likely contribute to the presence and survival of this species. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align in identifying Kalimantan as the Indonesian region linked to *Chlororhinia exempta*.
