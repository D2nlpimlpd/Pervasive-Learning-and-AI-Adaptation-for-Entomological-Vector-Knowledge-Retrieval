In 1979, HSUE described **Bellardia benshiensis**, **Bellardia bayeri liaoningensis**, and **Liaoning Bellardia**. The 1980s marked a prolific period, with **Sinohylemya ctenocnema** and **Sinohylemya craspedodonta** introduced in 1980, followed by **Hebecnema alba** (1983) and **Syllegopterula flava** (1983). In 1981, HSUE documented **Coenosis subflavicornis**, **Hydrophoria ventribarbata**, **Paraprosalpia qinghoensis**, **Pegomya centaureeodes**, and **Servaisia cothurnata**, the latter also in 1978. Additionally, HSUE described **Helina rastrella** in *Acta Entomologica Sinica* and **Phaonia recta** in 1984, along with **Phaonia aureoloides** in the same year. In 1982, HSUE contributed to the taxonomy of **Limnophora interfrons** and **Limnophora latiorbitalis**. Their work spans diverse genera such as *Blaesoxipha*, *Bellardia*, *Sinohylemya*, *Hydrotaea*, *Hydrophoria*, *Paraprosalpia*, *Pegomya*, *Servaisia*, *Limnophora*, and *Phaonia*, with notable species including *craspedodonta*, *ctenocnema*, *recta*, *aureoloides*, and *flava*. HSUE’s descriptions often appear in scientific literature, reflecting a focus on dipteran taxonomy. The entity’s contributions are marked by meticulous documentation of morphological and ecological traits, as seen in works like *Caricea odonta* (1981) and *Mydaea tinctoscutaris* and *Mydaea gracilior*. While some entries reference overlapping species (e.g., *Servaisia cothurnata* in 1978 and 1983), the data consistently attribute these to HSUE’s work.

These descriptions were published in the journal, which is also known by its Chinese name, 动物分类学报, and serves as a platform for taxonomic research in zoology. The journal's dual naming reflects its bilingual context, catering to both Chinese and international audiences. HSUE's work highlights the journal's role in documenting biodiversity, particularly in the field of animal taxonomy. The two species described by HSUE, *S. craspedodonta* and *S. ctenocnema*, are part of the broader scientific contributions featured in this academic resource. \n\nThe **Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy** (动物分类学报) is a specialized periodical that focuses on systematic biology, emphasizing the classification, identification, and nomenclature of animal taxa. It provides a venue for researchers to publish new species discoveries, taxonomic revisions, and related studies.
