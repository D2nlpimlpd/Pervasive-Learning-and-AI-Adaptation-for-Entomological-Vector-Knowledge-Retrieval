CUI co-described *Phaonia dupliciseta* and *Phaonia jagedaqiensis* alongside Ma, contributing to the taxonomic classification of these species. Additionally, CUI is credited as the sole author of *Acklandia aculeatoides* and *Acklandia curvata*, as well as *Phaonia gulianensis* and *Phaonia mimovivida*. Notably, CUI authored *Phaonia mimopalpata*, with a specific mention of its publication in *Acta Zoologica Sinica*. Collaborative efforts also include co-authoring the 1983 description of *Bellardia xinganensis* and the 1983 description of *Paraprosalpia recta*. In 1985, CUI co-authored the description of *Phaonia nigripennis*, alongside another co-describer, though the specific collaborator is not named in the data. A separate collaboration with Fang resulted in the co-description of *Helina unistriatoides*. Furthermore, CUI contributed to the 1983 description of *Megophyra biseta* as a co-author. These works span multiple genera and highlight CUI’s role in entomological taxonomy, particularly within the family Syrphidae (hoverflies) and related groups. The descriptions are spread across different publications and years, with *Acta Zoologica Sinica* being a key outlet for CUI’s research. While some entries specify co-authors (e.g., Ma, Fang), others do not, suggesting CUI worked both independently and in collaboration with various colleagues. The data collectively establish CUI as a significant contributor to the documentation of biodiversity in these taxa, with a focus on morphological and taxonomic studies.

It has conducted extensive surveys for **Hydrophoria species**, including a specific focus on **Hydrophoria melaena**, contributing to the study of these flies in the region. Simultaneously, the station serves as a critical repository for **type specimens** of the **Phaonia** genus, a group of flies significant to taxonomic and ecological research.  \n\nThe station preserves **holotype specimens** of several Phaonia species, such as **Phaonia angustiprosternum**, **Phaonia benxiensis**, **Phaonia yaluensis**, **Phaonia changbaishanensis**, and **Phaonia mimoaureola**, as well as the **type specimen of Phaonia ganshuensis**. A holotype is the single physical example designated as the official representative of a species, while type specimens collectively refer to the reference samples used to describe and classify new species. The station’s collection includes both roles, underscoring its importance in maintaining taxonomic standards for Phaonia.  \n\nNotably, the station is associated with researchers **MA, FANG, and CUI**, who have described Phaonia species preserved there. These species, including **Phaonia angustiprosternum** and **Phaonia benxiensis**, are linked to the station’s institutional responsibility for their type specimens. The diversity of preserved species reflects the station’s involvement in documenting regional biodiversity, particularly in areas like the Yalu River (Phaonia yaluensis) and Changbai Mountain (Phaonia changbaishanensis).  \n\nThe entity’s activities highlight its dual contributions to public health and scientific research. While its primary mandate likely involves health and epidemic prevention, its role in entomology extends to supporting studies on fly species, which may have implications for disease transmission, ecological monitoring, or environmental health. The preservation of these specimens ensures a reference for future taxonomic work and validates the region’s entomological records.  \n\nIn summary, the **Liaoning Provincial Health and Epidemic Prevention Station** is both a field research organization conducting surveys on Hydrophoria species and a custodian of type and holotype specimens for multiple Phaonia species, including those described by MA, FANG, and CUI. Its collection spans **Phaonia angustiprosternum**, **Phaonia benxiensis**, **Phaonia yaluensis**, **Phaonia changbaishanensis**, **Phaonia mimoaureola**, and **Phaonia ganshuensis**, emphasizing its role in advancing understanding of dipteran taxonomy and regional biodiversity. The station’s work bridges public health initiatives with scientific contributions to entomology, ensuring the preservation of critical biological data for future research.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",15\n3485,NIGRIGENIS PHANOIA,\"Phaonia nigrigenis, a species described by Ma and Feng with black knees and a type locality in Sichuan\",5\n900,FENG,\"\n\nFENG is a taxonomist recognized for their contributions to the classification and description of various insect species, particularly within the genera *Phaonia*, *Phorbia*, *Mydaea*, *Brontaea*, and *Paradichosia*. FENG has authored or co-authored multiple species and subspecies, often collaborating with researchers such as Xue and MA. Key works include the description of *Phaonia mimovivida* and *Phaonia nigrigenis* as sole author, as well as co-describing the subspecies *Mydaea setifemur kongdinga* with Xue. FENG also co-authored the description of *Phaonia cothurnoloba* with Xue and contributed to the characterization of *Phaonia pilipes*, *Phaonia suberrans*, and *Phaonia fissa* in collaborative efforts. Notably, FENG described *Phorbia gemmullata* in 1982 and is credited as the sole author of this species. Additionally, they co-authored the description of *Brontaea sichuanensis* and the new species *Megophyra subpenicillata*. FENG’s work extends to the *Paradichosia* genus, where they co-described *Paradichosia blaesostyla*, *Paradichosia brachyphalla*, and *Paradichosia kangdingensis*. Their research has been published in journals such as *Acta Zoologica Sinica*, where they collaborated on the description of *Phaonia cothurnoloba* and other *Phaonia* species. FENG’s partnership with MA is highlighted in the co-description of *Phaonia mimoincana*. While some descriptions mention FENG as a sole author and others as a co-author, the data consistently identifies their role in taxonomic research across multiple genera and species. Their work reflects a focus on dipteran taxonomy, with significant contributions to the understanding of biodiversity in these groups. The entity \"\"FENG\"\" is central to these descriptions, and their collaborations with Xue and MA are recurring themes in the taxonomic literature cited.

This species is distinguished by the absence of dark fringes on its wing cross-veins, a morphological characteristic that sets it apart from other members of the genus. The holotype (the single physical specimen used to define the species) was collected in Ya’an, Sichuan Province, China, which serves as the designated type locality for *Phania suberrans*. Feng’s work highlights the unique taxonomic features of this species, emphasizing its wing structure as a key identifier. While the initial description by Feng primarily focuses on the morphological traits and geographic origin, the designation of the holotype locality in Ya’an provides critical context for understanding its ecological and biogeographic significance. The species’ classification as a \"\"new species\"\" underscores its novelty in the scientific literature, contributing to the ongoing study of fly biodiversity in the Sichuan region.
