PONT is primarily associated with studies on the **Atherigona** genus, including ecological habit data for *Atherigona reversura* and *Atherigona oryzae*, as well as descriptions of *Atherigona kappa* (1981) and *Atherigona phi* (1981). Additionally, PONT contributed to the 1973 study on **sorghum shoot fly control**, which is also cited for its descriptions of *Atherigona triglomerata* and *Atherigona boninensis*, along with the species *613点芒蝇* and *614裸蹠芒蝇* (likely Chinese names for *Atherigona* species).  \n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, PONT described several fly species across diverse genera. These include *Drymeia altica* (1981) and *Drymeia beelzebub*, *Polietes orientalis* (1972) and *Polietes nigrolimbata* (1986), *Dasyphora kempi* (1977), and *Lispe leucospila* in the Soviet Union. PONT also co-described the genus *Huckettomyia* and its species *Huckettomyia watanabei* in 1970, and *Megophyra simpliceps*. In 1973, PONT documented the species *黑斑翠蝇 Neomyia (Scutellorthellia) lauta* and inferred **Saint-Sauveur** as its type locality.  \n\nPONT’s research on **Phaonia** groups in 1970 included noting similarities between species, later classifying *Ph. fuscitibia* as a subspecies of *Ph. angelicae* in 1986. In 1977, PONT documented species distribution in **India** and expressed doubts about the identification of *污瓣莫蝇* (likely *Musca contaminata* or a related species) in **Taiwan**. In 1986, PONT documented *Caricea vernalis* in **Mongolia**, though this may refer to a misclassification or unrelated work.  \n\nPONT is cited as a source for **European distribution data** and for studies on **Mesembrina** distribution and taxonomy. The 1973 sorghum shoot fly control study co-authored by PONT is linked to agricultural entomology, addressing pest management strategies. In 1981, PONT’s work on *Pyrellia cadaverina* and the *Phaonia* species *Ph. brendana* and *Ph. sibirica* further highlights their focus on fly taxonomy.  \n\nOverall, PONT’s contributions are characterized by meticulous species descriptions, ecological insights, and interdisciplinary work in agricultural entomology, with a geographic scope spanning Asia, Europe, and the Soviet Union. Their research on *Atherigona*, *Drymeia*, *Phaonia*, *Polietes*, and other genera has provided foundational taxonomic and distributional data, though some entries (e.g., *Caricea vernalis*) may involve errors or require contextual clarification. PONT’s 1973 and 1981 works remain key references in dipteran studies, particularly for species associated with sorghum pests and ecological classifications.\",41\n1832,JPN.JOURN.SANIT.ZOOL.,Jpn.Journ.Sanit.Zool. is a journal that describes the species Huckettomyia watanabei,2\n2500,WEST SAMOA,West Samoa is a country where the species is distributed,2\n2318,DASYPHORA KEMPI,,1\n2385,黑斑翠蝇NEOMYIA (SCUTELLORTHELLIA) LAUTA,,1\n2497,COCOS KEELING ISLANDS,Cocos Keeling Islands are a region where the species is distributed,1\n2498,NICOBAR ISLANDS,Nicobar Islands are a region where the species is distributed,1\n2501,FLORIDA,Florida is a U.S. state where the species is distributed,1\n2513,613点芒蝇ATHERIGONA PUNCTATA,\"A species of fly described by Karl in 1940, featuring black front tibiae and distinct wing patterns.
