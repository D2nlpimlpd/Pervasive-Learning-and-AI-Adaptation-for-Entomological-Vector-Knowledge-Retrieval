Among the species documented in the region are *Lucilia shenyangensis*, *Protocalliphora azurea*, and the Pseudo-Oriental Sarcophaga, all of which are found within Shandong's ecological framework. The province also hosts *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa*, a parasitic fly species, as well as *Atherigona yiwulushan*, another fly species associated with its local environment. Additionally, Shandong is noted as a habitat for two specific parasitic flies: 1462灰腹狭颊寄蝇 (*Sarcophaga griseabdominalis*), commonly referred to as the gray-bellied narrow-cheeked flesh fly, and 1465松毛虫狭颊寄蝇 (*Sarcophaga dendrolimus*), linked to pine caterpillar infestations. The region further serves as a distribution site for 绯胫纹蝇 (*Chrysomya rufifemur*), a blowfly species whose presence in Shandong underscores the province's role in supporting diverse dipteran fauna. These findings highlight Shandong's ecological importance as a center for the distribution of both common and specialized fly species, contributing to broader studies of biodiversity and parasitism in China. The province's varied habitats, including agricultural, forested, and urban areas, likely facilitate the coexistence of these species, though specific ecological interactions remain under investigation. Collectively, the data emphasize Shandong's prominence in entomological research and its relevance to understanding the geographic spread of insect populations in eastern China.\",8\n2376,北非,\"\n\n北非（North Africa）是非洲北部的一个地理区域，涵盖多个国家，包括摩洛哥等。该地区是多种生物物种的分布区，尤其在昆虫学领域具有重要研究价值。根据现有数据，北非是滨边小蝇（Schoenomyza litorella）的分布区域之一，这种蝇类可能以该地区为原生地或次生分布区。此外，黑斑翠蝇（Neomyia (Scutellorthellia) lauta）也广泛分布于北非，其范围明确包括摩洛哥，表明该物种在这一区域具有显著的生态适应性。蓝色原皮蝇（Protocalliphora azurea）同样以北非为其分布范围的一部分，进一步凸显该地区在昆虫多样性中的地位。  \n\n值得注意的是，部分描述提到北非是“某些物种分布的外国地区”，这可能指一些物种并非原生于北非，而是通过自然扩散或人为活动引入的。例如，某些蝇类可能因气候条件适宜而在此形成次生种群，或与国际交流相关而扩展至该区域。同时，北非也被描述为“国际物种分布的区域”，说明其地理位置可能成为连接欧洲、亚洲与非洲的生态桥梁，部分物种在此呈现跨区域分布特征。  \n\n综合来看，北非既是多种蝇类的原生栖息地（如黑斑翠蝇），也是部分物种的非原生分布区（如可能的滨边小蝇和蓝色原皮蝇）。这一矛盾可通过物种迁移或生态适应性解释，例如气候变化、人类活动或与其他地区的生态联系可能促进物种扩散。摩洛哥作为北非的典型国家，其境内记录的黑斑翠蝇分布进一步佐证了该地区的生态重要性。北非的生物地理特征使其成为研究物种分布动态、生态适应性及跨区域生态交流的关键区域。  \n\n（字数：248）\",3\n2175,宁夏,\"\n\nNingxia, officially the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is a region in China known for its diverse entomological fauna. It serves as a domestic distribution location for several fly species, including *Exorista rossica*, *Protocalliphora azurea*, *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa*, and *Dialyta halterata*, as documented in sources such as *动物分类学报* (Acta Zoologica Sinica). The region is also associated with the presence of *Rypellia*, specifically in the counties of Jingyuan and Guyuan, according to Zhao’s 1981 research. Additionally, populations of *Musca vitripennis* (glasswinged housefly) have been recorded in Ningxia. Notably, the area is the domestic distribution site of the *Helanshan European fly* (贺兰山欧麻蝇), a species linked to the Helan Mountains within the region.  \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to Ningxia as a \"\"province,\"\" it is officially an autonomous region, a distinction reflecting its unique administrative status within China. The mention of \"\"province\"\" in certain sources likely stems from colloquial or outdated terminology. Ningxia’s ecological significance is underscored by its role as a habitat for these diverse fly species, which span both native and potentially invasive taxa. The presence of *Exorista rossica* and *Protocalliphora azurea* highlights its importance in the study of parasitic and predatory flies, while *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa* and *Dialyta halterata* contribute to understanding regional biodiversity. The documentation of *Rypellia* in Jingyuan and Guyuan, along with *Musca vitripennis*, further emphasizes Ningxia’s varied ecosystems and their capacity to support specialized insect populations. The *Helanshan European fly* adds to this list, tying the region’s fauna to its geographical features, such as the Helan Mountains.  \n\nIn summary, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a key area in China for the distribution of multiple fly species, including both common and regionally significant taxa. Its status as an autonomous region, rather than a province, is critical to its administrative and ecological context. The region’s entomological records, spanning scientific literature and historical studies, illustrate its role in broader biological and taxonomic research. Specific localities like Jingyuan and Guyuan are highlighted for their contributions to the documented presence of *Rypellia*, underscoring the need for localized ecological studies.
