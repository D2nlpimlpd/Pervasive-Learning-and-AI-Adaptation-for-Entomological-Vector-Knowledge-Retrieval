It serves as a domestic habitat for multiple genera and species, including **Lucilia shenyangensis**, **Protocalliphora azurea**, **Protocalliphora chrysorrhoea**, and **Sericomyia brunneipennis** (棕翅阳蝇). The province is also home to **Chenomyia** (陈氏污蝇) and **Jiemyia** (介污蝇) species, as well as **Dasyphora** species, which are part of its ecological biodiversity. Additionally, Gansu hosts **Hypoderma lineatum** and **Hypoderma sinense**, both significant in veterinary contexts as bot fly species affecting livestock.  \n\nThe region is notable for the presence of **Gasterophilus** species, which are horse bots, and **Rypellia**, a genus of flesh flies found in specific locations such as **Wenxian** and **Minxian**. Gansu is a key area for **Helina maquensis** and **Helina rariciliata**, two species within the Helina genus. Furthermore, it supports multiple species in the **Phaonia group** (细鬃棘蝇群) characterized by fine bristles, including **Ph. aureolicauda Ma et Wu** and **Ph. subtenuiseta Ma et Wu**. The province is also a distribution site for **rabbit bot flies** (兔裸皮蝇) and **cattle bot flies** (牛皮蝇), underscoring its role in harboring economically and ecologically relevant insect populations.  \n\nThese findings collectively highlight Gansu’s significance as a biodiversity hotspot for flies, with its varied ecosystems supporting both common and specialized species.
