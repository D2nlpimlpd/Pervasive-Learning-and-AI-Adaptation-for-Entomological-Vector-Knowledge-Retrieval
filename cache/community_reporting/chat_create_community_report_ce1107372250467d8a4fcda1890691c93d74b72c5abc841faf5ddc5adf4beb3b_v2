The genus includes species such as *青稞穗蝇* (barley stem fly), which is notable for its ecological and agricultural significance. Taxonomically, Nanna belongs to the order Diptera (true flies) and is part of the broader group of scathophagid flies, commonly referred to as dung flies or flower flies, though this classification may vary depending on specific phylogenetic studies. Morphological features of the genus, beyond the abdominal bristle ratio, likely include traits such as body size, wing venation, or coloration patterns typical of Scathophagidae, though these are not explicitly detailed in the provided descriptions. The Chinese name *穗蝇属* directly translates to \"\"spike fly genus,\"\" reflecting the association of some species within the genus with plant spikes or stems, as seen in *青稞穗蝇*. This species is particularly relevant in regions where barley is cultivated, as it may impact crop health. While the descriptions do not elaborate on the geographic distribution or behavioral ecology of the genus, the inclusion of *青稞穗蝇* suggests a focus on species with agricultural or ecological importance. The genus Nanna is thus defined by its taxonomic placement in Scathophagidae, the 1:2 abdominal bristle ratio, and the presence of species like the barley stem fly, which are linked to plant interactions. Further research or detailed taxonomic studies would be required to fully delineate the morphological, ecological, and phylogenetic scope of the genus.
