The region is home to multiple genera and species, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Mesembrina* spp., *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *albiceps*, *Servillia planiforceps*, and *Polleniopsis* spp. (e.g., *P. dalatensis*, *P. lata*, *P. milina*, and *P. cuonaensis*). Specific locations within Tibet, such as Lhasa, Shigatse, Heihe, Medog, Anduo, Yadong, Congna, Zhangmu, Quchan, and Mangkang Haitong, are highlighted as key habitats for these species. For instance, Medog is noted as the type locality for *Isomyia viridiscutellata* and *Helina hirtifemorata*, while Lhasa is the type locality for *Morellia hortorum tibetana* and *Lispe alpinicola*. \n\nTibet's insect fauna includes notable genera like *Dichaetomyia* (e.g., *Setifemur dichaetomyia* in Mêdog and Gedang), *Drymeia* (e.g., *D. magnifica*, *D. yadongensis*, and others such as *D. midtibia* and *D. beelzebub*), *Pegohylemyia* (e.g., *P. tuxeni*, *P. nigrigenis*, *P. coloriforcipis*, and *P. mediospicula*), and *Pegomya* (e.g., *P. medogensis* and *P. exilis*). The region also hosts species like *Bellardia oligochaeta*, *Delia atrifrons*, *Delia tenuipensis*, *Delia quadrilateralis*, *Macronychia striginervis*, *Tachina noctuarum*, *Tibetan Oestroderma*, *Chirosia* spp. (e.g., *C. similata*, *C. betuleti*, *C. albitarsis*, *C. frontata*, and *C. laticerca*), and *Eudasyphora cyanicolor*. Additionally, *Eutrichota bilobella*, *Helicophagella rohdendorfi* (found in Milin and Geling), *Miltogramma tibitum*, *Miltogramma brevipilum*, and *Miltogramma testaceifrons* are documented in the region. \n\nThe area is further associated with species such as *Blondelia nigripes*, *Drino facialis*, *Gymnadichosia pusilla*, *1353 Lhasa Pierretia Fly*, *Himalayan Spring Fly* (in Zayu), *I. euidielloides*, *Insecta lapponica* (in Motuo), *KENT'S SARCOPHAGA*, *Lasiomma octoguttatum* and *L. strigilatum* (in Lhasa and Moktuo), *Leucophora aurantifrons* and *L. xizangensis*, *Nupedia aestiva*, *Phorbia securis xibeina*, *Phorbia tysoni*, *Phorbia subsymmetrica*, *Phorbia pilostyla*, *Sinochirosia variegata*, *Siphona cristata*, *Strongyloneura prasina*, *Winthemia* spp., and *Zhadacu Song* (4350 meters).
