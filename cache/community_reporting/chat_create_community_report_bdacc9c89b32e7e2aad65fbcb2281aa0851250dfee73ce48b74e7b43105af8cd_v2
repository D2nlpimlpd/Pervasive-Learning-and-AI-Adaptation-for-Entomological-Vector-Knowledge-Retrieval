It is associated with research on the genus *Pegohylemyia*, where species such as *Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes* and *Pegohylemyia sonchi* are found. The region serves as the type locality for the *Egle* genus and its species *Egle parva*, as well as for *Paraprosalpia silvatica*, which is also distributed there. Additionally, Hokkaido is the type locality for *Pegohylemyia spinisternata*, further emphasizing its role in taxonomic studies.  \n\nThe region hosts a variety of distributed species, including *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Meliniella griseifrons*, *Metopia leucocephala*, and *Calliphora axata*. The genus *Chirosia* is well-represented, with *Chirosia similata*, *Chirosia albitarsis*, and *Chirosia betuleti* all documented in Hokkaido. *Gymnadichosia pusilla* (Yellow-Legged Naked Variant Beauty Fly) and *Pegoplata virginea* are also found there, alongside *Fucellia boninensis* and *Fucellia apicalis*. Chiastocheta species are present, though specific names are not provided.  \n\nHokkaido is notable for being the site of the first description of *Pegomya japonica* and for the distribution of *Pegomya criniventris*. The region is home to *Phaonia luteovittata*, which has its type locality there, and the subspecies *Brontaea ezensis* and *Brontaea ezensis latifronta* are compared within its ecosystems. The Chinese names 斑足莠蝇 and 亚山花蝇, corresponding to *Phaonia katoi* and *Phaonia xanthofemina*, are also documented as distributed in Hokkaido.  \n\nFurthermore, Hokkaido is linked to the genus *Dexopollenia*, though specific species are not detailed. The region’s ecological importance is underscored by its role as a foreign type locality for *Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes* (referred to as 拟野亚麻蝇 in the Chinese description). These findings highlight Hokkaido as a critical area for studying dipteran biodiversity, with contributions to both distributional records and taxonomic classifications. Its unique status as a type locality for multiple genera and species, combined with the presence of diverse fly populations, positions Hokkaido as a focal point in entomological research in Japan.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",17\n521,CHIROSIA SIMILATA,\"\n\n**Chirosia similata** is a species of fly within the genus *Chirosia*, first described by Tiensuu in 1939. It is characterized by distinct morphological features, including rounded anal and lateral caudal lobes, and a body length of approximately 5 mm. The species exhibits a broad geographic distribution, spanning multiple regions across Asia and Europe. It has been recorded in **Liaoning Province** (specifically in **Benxi Nandian**), **Tibet** (with a documented presence in **Motuo**), and **Japan** (particularly in **Hokkaido**). Additionally, *Chirosia similata* is found in **Europe**, where **Helsinki** serves as the type locality, marking the original location from which the species was described. The inclusion of these specific sites within the broader regions highlights its adaptability to diverse habitats. While the two descriptions provided align on the taxonomic classification, year of description, and general distribution, the first offers more detailed locality information, which is integrated here to form a comprehensive overview. No contradictions exist between the sources, allowing for a unified summary of the species’ key attributes and range.\",12\n3315,PHAONIA XANTHOHEMINA,,1\n612,AUSTRIA,\"\n\nAustria, a landlocked country in Central Europe, is notable for its role as a habitat and type locality for several insect species. It is a European country where the species *Helina quadrum* and *Helina longicornis* are distributed, contributing to its biodiversity. The country also serves as the type locality for *Strobilomyia laricicola* and *Strobilomyia anthracinum*, with the former specifically associated with the Alps region, highlighting Austria’s alpine ecosystems as critical for these species. Additionally, *Fannia leucosticta* has its type locality in Austria, underscoring the country’s significance in entomological taxonomy. \n\nAustria is further recognized as a distribution site for *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (a species likely identified by a numerical code or local name, possibly related to the genus *Fannia* or another fly group), as well as *Pegohylemyia sanctimarci*, which has been observed in the region by entomologist Marcus. The country also hosts *Phylloteles pictipennis* and *Coenosia octopunctata*, both of which are part of its broader insect fauna. Notably, some species, such as *Strobilomyia laricicola*, are described as having an international distribution with Austria as a key location, indicating the country’s ecological connectivity to other regions. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Austria’s role in both local and global entomological contexts, with its alpine and temperate habitats supporting a range of fly species. While most references align with Austria’s status as a European country, one description ambiguously states \"\"the species is found internationally\"\" without specifying the species, which is resolved here by including all explicitly named species. The inclusion of type localities (e.g., for *Strobilomyia* and *Fannia leucosticta*) reinforces Austria’s importance in scientific classification, while the mention of international distribution for certain species highlights its ecological relevance beyond national borders. Overall, Austria’s diverse environments, including the Alps, provide critical habitats for these insects, making it a focal point for entomological research and conservation.\",9\n534,CHIROSIA S.

MUSC. SUEC.,\"\n\n**MON. MUSC. SUEC.** is an academic journal that served as a key publication for entomological research, particularly in the 19th century. The journal's full title, *Monographia Muscis Suecica*, translates to \"\"Monograph on Swedish Flies,\"\" reflecting its focus on documenting and classifying fly species native to Sweden. In 1823, it was the venue for the original description of *Spilogona litorea litorea*, a species within the genus *Spilogona* (family Muscidae). This entry marked a significant contribution to the taxonomy of flies, establishing the species' scientific nomenclature and initial classification.  \n\nAdditionally, the journal is referenced in relation to the description of *圆斑莠蝇* (Musca), a Chinese name for a species of fly. While the scientific name \"\"Musca\"\" typically refers to the housefly genus, the specific context here aligns with the 1823 publication in *MON. MUSC. SUEC.*, suggesting that the species in question may be a distinct member of the Muscidae family or a related group. The use of the Chinese name *圆斑莠蝇* (\"\"Spotted Housefly\"\") indicates regional recognition of the species, though the journal's primary role was to provide a formal taxonomic framework for Swedish fauna.  \n\nThe 1823 issue of *MON. MUSC. SUEC.* thus contains two notable entries: the formal description of *Spilogona litorea litorea* and the documentation of *圆斑莠蝇* (Musca), both underscoring the journal's historical importance in entomology. While the exact relationship between these two species remains unclear due to differing nomenclature (one using a Latinized scientific name and the other a vernacular-Chinese term with a genus-level identifier), the journal's role as a source for their 1823 descriptions is consistent. This highlights its dual function in both scientific classification and regional species identification during the early 19th century.  \n\nThe journal's legacy lies in its foundational work for Swedish entomology, providing a taxonomic baseline for species like *Spilogona litorea litorea* and contributing to the broader understanding of fly biodiversity. Its 1823 publications remain critical for modern researchers tracing the historical classification of these organisms. The mention of *圆斑莠蝇* (Musca) also suggests potential cross-regional taxonomic connections, though further study would be required to reconcile the naming conventions and confirm whether these entries refer to the same or distinct species. Overall, *MON. MUSC. SUEC.* exemplifies the role of 19th-century monographs in advancing systematic biology.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",2\n4569,METOPIA LECUOCEPHALA,\"A species of fly described by Rossi in 1790, with synonyms and distributions across China and Japan.>\",6\n4570,ROSSI,Author of the 1790 description of Metopia leucocephala.>,1\n471,CHIROSIA RONDANI,Chirosia Rondani is a person who described the genus Chirosia in 1856,1\n5294,JAP.FOUR.EXP.MED.,\"1950年拟野亚麻蝇的描述文献《Jap.four.Exp.Med., 20: 825-827, figs.15-27(Sarcophaga)》\",1\n1664,COQUILLET,Author of Syngamoptera flavipes (1898) in Proc.
