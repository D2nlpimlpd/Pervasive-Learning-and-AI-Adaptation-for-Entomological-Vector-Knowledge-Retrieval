Their work is closely associated with the 1935 Siberian records of these species' host plants, contributing to the understanding of their ecological relationships. The descriptions provided align in identifying Zonova as a key figure in this early entomological study, emphasizing their role in cataloging the specific plants on which *Strobilomyia* species were observed to interact. This research likely involved field observations and systematic analysis of the insects' feeding, reproduction, or habitat preferences in relation to their host flora. While the details of the methodology or findings are not explicitly outlined in the given data, the association with Siberian records from that year highlights the historical and geographical significance of their contributions. Zonova’s documentation remains a reference point for studies on *Strobilomyia* and its ecological niche in the region.\",2\n2760,LISPE FRIGIDA,\"Lispe frigida is a species of fly described by Erichson in 1851, distributed in China, Siberia, and North America\",6\n611,SIBERIA,\"\n\nSiberia, a vast region in Russia (formerly part of the Soviet Union), is recognized as a significant area for the distribution of various dipteran species, particularly within the families Tachinidae, Muscidae, and others. It has been historically documented in entomological studies, including Hennig’s 1970 research on the genus *Pegohylemyia*, which highlighted its ecological relevance. The region is home to multiple species such as *Fannia similis*, *Fannia incisurata*, *Hydrophoria fasciculata*, *Wohlfahrtia bella*, *Xanthotryxus mongol*, and *Calliphora axata*, all of which are associated with the Soviet Union era. Additionally, species like *Phaonia basiseta*, *Phaonia incana*, and *Phaonia subfuscinervis* are reported to inhabit Siberia, as are *Agria punctata*, *Ceromyia silacea*, and *Subhylemyia longula*. The genus *Oestromyia* and *Sinonipponia* are also noted as distributed in the region, alongside *Strobilomyia infrequens* and *Strobilomyia laricicola*, with the latter being specifically linked to the area. \n\nSiberia’s biodiversity includes species with type localities in the region, such as *Lispe frigida* and *Heteronychia bajkalensis* (associated with Lake Baikal). The area is further notable for the presence of *Senotainia (Sphixapata) sibirica*, *Sarcophaga variegata*, and *Helina parcepilosa*. The Caesar Greenbottle Fly, a common name for an unspecified species, and *Robineauella scoparia* are also documented as occurring in Siberia. Beyond domestic distribution, the region is cited as an international range for *Chiastocheta latispinigera* and *Calythea nigra*, underscoring its role in broader biogeographical contexts. \n\nWhile some descriptions reference the Soviet Union, others specify modern-day Russia, reflecting the region’s historical and contemporary taxonomic significance. The overlap of genera and species, such as *Strobilomyia* and *Wohlfahrtia*, indicates a shared ecological niche in Siberia’s diverse habitats. This synthesis consolidates all provided data into a unified account of Siberia’s entomological importance, emphasizing its role as a key area for the study and distribution of these fly species.\",21\n2753,ERICHSON,\"\n\nERICHSON, also known as Erichson, was an entomologist and author who described the species *Lispe frigida* in 1851. As an entomologist, Erichson contributed to the scientific classification of insects, with his work on *Lispe frigida* being a notable example. The species *Lispe frigida*, which he formally documented in 1851, is part of the broader taxonomic efforts in 19th-century entomology. His role as both an author and a specialist in insect taxonomy underscores his significance in the field during that period. The description of *Lispe frigida* remains a key reference in entomological literature, reflecting Erichson's dedication to advancing the understanding of insect biodiversity. No contradictions exist in the provided descriptions, as both consistently identify Erichson as the individual responsible for the 1851 classification of *Lispe frigida* and his profession as an entomologist.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n590,SOVIET UNION,ZONOVA,Zonova's research on Strobilomyia species is linked to the Soviet Union,129\n4923,昆虫学研究集刊,LISPE FRIGIDA,Lispe frigida was documented in the journal 昆虫学研究集刊,37\n575,SIBERIA,STROBILOMYIA LARICICOLA,\"Strobilomyia laricicola is distributed in Siberia, Soviet Union\",32\n4929,ERICHSON,LISPE FRIGIDA,Erichson described the species Lispe frigida in 1851,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
