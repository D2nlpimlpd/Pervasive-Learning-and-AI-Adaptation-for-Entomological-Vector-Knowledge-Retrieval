The region is also noted as the main geographic distribution area for the **Silbomyia genus**, spanning China, India, and Southeast Asia. Additionally, it hosts the **12th fly genus, Paradichosia**, alongside adjacent regions. The Oriental Region is characterized by its biodiversity, supporting a wide array of fly species and genera, many of which are endemic or have significant ecological roles within the area. While some descriptions emphasize its coverage of eastern Asia, others clarify its focus on South and Southeast Asia, with the Soviet Far East as a northern extension. The region’s importance in entomology is underscored by the presence of multiple genera, including **Egenia**, **Syngamoptera**, and **Xenotachina**, which are explicitly tied to its biogeographic boundaries. The inclusion of species like *Musca sorbens* and *Dexopollenia* further highlights its role as a hub for diverse fly populations. Despite minor variations in phrasing (e.g., \"\"geographical region\"\" vs. \"\"biogeographic region\"\"), all descriptions converge on the Oriental Region as a key area for the distribution of these taxa, with no significant contradictions in its definition or scope.

Its geographic distribution spans the Oriental region, with specific records from Zhejiang, Taiwan, and Guangdong in China, as well as Chiang Mai in Thailand. These locations highlight its presence in both mainland and island ecosystems within the broader Oriental biogeographic zone. The species’ classification as the type for *Dinemomyia* underscores its foundational role in defining the genus, while its morphological traits and regional occurrence provide key insights into its ecological and taxonomic significance.

The region is characterized by temperate to boreal climates and includes coastal areas, which are particularly notable for the presence of **Leucomyia** species. Key taxa associated with the Palaeoarctic Region include multiple **Phaonia** groups and species, the **Star Island Greenbottle Fly**, and the genera **Egenia**, **Syngamoptera**, and **Xenotachina**. Additionally, the region is home to **Polietes lardaria**, a species found in northern Asia, Europe, and northern Africa, and **Agriella gobica**, which is distributed within this area. The **Heteronychia** genus is primarily concentrated in the European and Mediterranean portions of the Palaeoarctic Region, highlighting regional biodiversity hotspots. While some descriptions emphasize the broader Eurasian and African coverage, others specify localized distributions, such as coastal habitats for **Leucomyia** and Mediterranean focus for **Heteronychia**. These variations are reconciled by recognizing the Palaeoarctic Region as a vast, heterogeneous area with distinct subregions supporting specialized faunas.
