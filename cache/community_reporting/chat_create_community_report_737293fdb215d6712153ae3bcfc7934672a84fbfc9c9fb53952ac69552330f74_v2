The city is explicitly associated with the **GRACILIFORCEPS SARCOPHAGA**, a species of fly whose range includes this region. Additionally, Chongqing is home to the **1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly** and the **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**, two distinct species identified by their specific descriptors. These flies are part of the broader Pierretia genus, which is noted to have a presence in the area. The city also overlaps with the distribution of **Calliphora axata**, a blowfly species commonly found in Sichuan. Furthermore, Chongqing is linked to the **PIERRETIACAUDAGALLI**, a species name that appears to be a variant or misspelling of the Pierretia flies mentioned earlier, likely referring to a related or specific subspecies within the same genus. \n\nWhile the descriptions provided are consistent in identifying Chongqing as part of Sichuan Province, minor discrepancies arise in the naming of the Pierretia species. The term \"\"PIERRETIACAUDAGALLI\"\" may represent a scientific name for one of the Pierretia flies (e.g., *Pierretia caudagalli*), potentially conflating the \"\"Slender-leaf\"\" and \"\"Tail\"\" descriptors from the second description. To resolve this, the summary integrates all references, acknowledging both the numbered species (1349 and 1354) and the possible alternative nomenclature for the Pierretia genus. The inclusion of **Calliphora axata** and **GRACILIFORCEPS SARCOPHAGA** further underscores Chongqing’s ecological significance as a region supporting diverse fly populations. \n\nIn total, Chongqing’s role as a distribution site for these species highlights its importance in entomological studies, particularly for blowflies and Pierretia flies, which may have implications for forensic science, biodiversity research, or ecological monitoring. The city’s location in Sichuan, a province known for its varied ecosystems, likely contributes to the presence of these species. All descriptions converge on Chongqing as a shared habitat for these flies, with no major contradictions in location or core biological classifications.

It is notable for its association with two distinct species in biological taxonomy. First, it is the type locality for *Achoetandrus rufifacies*, a species whose classification and study are tied to this location. Second, Jigongshan is recognized as the type locality for the \"\"1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly,\"\" a specific taxonomic entry indicating the site where this species was first identified and described. These associations highlight the city's role in biodiversity research and its importance as a hub for entomological and zoological studies within Henan province. While the descriptions emphasize JIGONGSHAN's connection to these species, they do not provide additional details about the city’s population, cultural significance, or other geographical features. The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the specific geographic location used to define a species in scientific nomenclature, underscoring Jigongshan’s contribution to the documentation of regional fauna. All provided information aligns with the entity being a city in Henan, China, and no contradictions exist among the descriptions. The summary consolidates the key points: JIGONGSHAN’s status as a city, its role as a type locality for both *Achoetandrus rufifacies* and the Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly (1349), and its broader significance in the study of local biodiversity.

Additionally, Yingshan is identified as a habitat for the **1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly**, which is associated with the local flora and fauna. The city is also home to **Musca bezzii**, a species of fly that has been recorded in the area.
