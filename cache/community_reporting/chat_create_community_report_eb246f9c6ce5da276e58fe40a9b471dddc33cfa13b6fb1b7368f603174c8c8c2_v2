The genus *Adia* is present, as are *Musca autumnalis*, *M. conducens*, *M. tempestiva*, and *M. tempestiva* (秋家蝇, a Chinese name for a *Musca* species). *Delia latissima*, *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Helicophagella maculata*, *Hydrotaea mimopilipes*, *H. palaestrica* (noted at Longde), and *I. tripartita* are also part of Ningxia’s entomological records. The region is notable for *Xylotachina diluta*, which parasitizes an unnamed wood borer species, and *Phormia regina* in Yinchuan. Specific locations within Ningxia, such as Helan Mountains, Tongxin, Luoshan, and Liupan Mountain (where *Helina intermedia* is found), are frequently cited in species studies. The Chinese names 紫翠蝇 and 绿翠蝇, likely referring to *Helina* or related species, are documented in the region. Ningxia’s biodiversity is further highlighted by the presence of *Haematobia* and the documented distribution of *Periscepsia carbonaria*. These findings underscore Ningxia’s ecological importance as a habitat for a wide array of fly species, many of which play roles in parasitism, decomposition, or as indicators of environmental health. The region’s varied landscapes, including mountainous and arid areas, contribute to its status as a key location for entomological research in China.

It is recognized as the type locality for the species *Pierrettia tsintaoensis*, meaning this location is where the species was first identified and described scientifically. Additionally, Qingdao is part of the geographic distribution range for *Calliphora axata*, a blowfly species commonly associated with forensic entomology and ecological studies. The city’s significance in biological contexts is further underscored by its role in the documentation of these two species, which are linked to its regional environment. While the descriptions primarily emphasize Qingdao’s administrative and geographic identity as a coastal city in Shandong, the specific references to *Pierrettia tsintaoensis* and *Calliphora axata* highlight its importance in scientific research and biodiversity records. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as all align on the city’s location and its association with the mentioned species.

It is a major metropolitan area located in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula, known for its modern infrastructure, historical landmarks, and vibrant urban life. Beyond its role as a capital, Seoul is also recognized as a city in Korea where the species *Calliphora axata*, commonly referred to as the Caesar Greenbottle Fly, is distributed. This fly, a member of the blowfly family (Calliphoridae), is notable for its ecological and forensic significance, often associated with decomposition processes and used in entomological studies. The presence of *Calliphora axata* in Seoul highlights the city's biodiversity within its urban and surrounding natural environments. The species is sometimes called the Caesar Greenbottle Fly due to its metallic green coloration and distinctive appearance, which aligns with its scientific classification. While the descriptions emphasize Seoul's dual identity as both a capital and a habitat for this specific fly, there are no contradictions in the provided data, as all references consistently identify the city as the central entity. The summary integrates these aspects to present a cohesive overview of Seoul's geographical and biological relevance.\",3\n2368,BECHSTEIN ET SCHAFENBERG,Authors of the species Musca cornicina,1\n2481,HAEMATOBIOPSIS EXIGUA,Haematobia exigua is a species of fly described by de Meijere in 1903,31\n2462,DE MEIJERE,\"\n\n**DE MEIJERE** was an entomologist and scientific author known for his contributions to the taxonomy of insect species. He is credited with describing two notable species: *Bengalia (Eubengalia) latro* in 1910 and *Haematobia exigua* in 1903. The species *Bengalia latro* was later reclassified under the genus *Eubengalia*, reflecting updated taxonomic understanding, but De Meijere’s original 1910 description remains foundational to its classification. Additionally, his 1903 work on *Haematobia exigua* established its formal recognition in entomological literature. These contributions highlight his role in documenting and categorizing insect biodiversity during the early 20th century. De Meijere’s expertise in entomology and his meticulous descriptions of species have left a lasting impact on the field, providing critical reference points for subsequent research and taxonomic revisions. His work exemplifies the collaborative and evolving nature of scientific classification, where initial descriptions often serve as the basis for future refinements. By publishing these species, De Meijere advanced the understanding of their ecological and taxonomic significance, ensuring their inclusion in broader studies of insect morphology and distribution. Despite the limited information available about his broader career, his specific contributions to the classification of *Bengalia (Eubengalia) latro* and *Haematobia exigua* underscore his importance as a historical figure in entomology. The two species he described, separated by seven years, demonstrate his active engagement in the study of insects during a period of significant taxonomic activity. While *Bengalia latro* is associated with a reclassification under *Eubengalia*, the original 1910 description by De Meijere remains a key citation in its scientific history. Similarly, *Haematobia exigua*, first described in 1903, continues to be referenced in entomological contexts, attesting to the enduring value of his work. De Meijere’s legacy is preserved in the nomenclatural records of these species, which are now integral to ongoing research and conservation efforts. His dual role as both an author and entomologist reflects the interdisciplinary nature of early 20th-century scientific practice, where detailed fieldwork and literary documentation were closely intertwined. The absence of conflicting details in the provided descriptions allows for a unified account of his contributions, emphasizing his precision and dedication to the field. Overall, DE MEIJERE’s work remains a testament to the foundational role of early taxonomists in building the framework for modern entomological science.

As a major urban center in the region, Lanzhou is situated along the Yellow River and is known for its historical, cultural, and economic importance in northwestern China. The city’s association with these species highlights its ecological relevance in entomological studies. *Parasarcophaga aegyptica*, a parasitoid fly, is documented to inhabit areas within Lanzhou, contributing to local biodiversity and potentially playing a role in pest control or ecosystem dynamics. Similarly, *Lasiomma curtigena*, a species of cicada, is also reported to be distributed in the city, indicating the presence of suitable habitats for its life cycle, such as forests or shrublands. The repeated mention of Lanzhou’s connection to these species across the descriptions underscores its status as a key location for their study and conservation. While the descriptions do not provide specific details about the ecological interactions or population trends of these species, they collectively affirm Lanzhou’s role in their geographic range. The city’s climate, characterized by cold winters and hot summers, and its semi-arid environment may influence the distribution patterns of both organisms. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions consistently identify Lanzhou as a city in Gansu Province, China, and link it to the presence of these species. This synthesis integrates the core information from the descriptions, emphasizing Lanzhou’s dual significance as a human settlement and a biological hotspot for *Parasarcophaga aegyptica* and *Lasiomma curtigena*.
