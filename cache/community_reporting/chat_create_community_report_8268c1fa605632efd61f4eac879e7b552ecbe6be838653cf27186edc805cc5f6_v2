It is characterized by a distinct central light brown powder stripe on the interfrontal area of the head in both sexes. Males exhibit a wide forehead, occupying approximately one-quarter of the head’s width, and a broad interfrontal area that is three times wider than one side of the forehead. Females, in contrast, possess more than two rows of frontal bristles. Morphologically, the r4+5 vein of the wing has small bristles only at its base, which do not extend beyond the r-m cross vein. The body length of *Stomoxys calcitrans* ranges from 5 to 8 mm.  \n\nThis species is widely distributed, occurring nationwide in China and globally in regions excluding northern latitudes. Its larvae develop in organic substrates such as livestock manure and garbage, while adults are frequently observed in high-density populations near livestock feed sources, including tofu residue. The ecological and behavioral traits of *Stomoxys calcitrans* align with its role as a synanthropic pest, thriving in human-altered environments.  \n\nSubsequent taxonomic references to the species include works by Zimin (1951) and Ho (何琦, 1936), who expanded on its classification and distribution. Despite its broad geographic range, the species remains notable for its specific morphological markers, such as the interfrontal stripe and venation patterns, which aid in distinguishing it from closely related *Stomoxys* species. Its association with livestock and organic waste underscores its economic and public health significance, particularly in agricultural settings.  \n\n(Word count: 130)\",9\n2125,HONG KONG,\"\n\n**HONG KONG** is a Chinese territory located in the southeastern coast of China, known for its unique biodiversity and ecological significance.

Additionally, Hong Kong is recognized as a region where *Stomoxys sitiens* is distributed, indicating the presence of this species within its ecosystems. The territory also hosts *Musca pilifacies*, further highlighting its role as a habitat for diverse fly species. These descriptions collectively underscore Hong Kong’s importance in entomological research and its contribution to the study of dipteran fauna. The mention of multiple species aligns with its status as a biodiversity hotspot, influenced by its subtropical climate and varied habitats. No contradictions exist among the provided data, as each statement refers to distinct species and their specific associations with the region. The summary emphasizes Hong Kong’s ecological value and its role in documenting and supporting these insect populations.\",3\n2410,FJIAN,\"\n\nFujian, a province in China, is home to a diverse range of insect species, as indicated by the provided data. The province serves as a habitat for **Argyrophylax phoeda** and **Argyrophylax nigrotibialis**, both of which are distributed within its territory. Additionally, **Stomoxys sitiens**, a species of fly, is also documented as being present in Fujian. Another notable species, **Melinda maai Kurahashi, 1970**, is specifically noted to inhabit the province, with the year of its taxonomic description included in the reference. The data further identifies **Brontaea tonitrui** as a species distributed in Fujian, though no additional details about its classification or ecological role are provided. Lastly, the **732 HEYUAN HUI FLY** is recorded as a species found in the region, though its scientific name or taxonomic context remains unclear from the given information.  \n\nCollectively, these descriptions highlight Fujian’s ecological significance as a biodiversity hotspot for various insect species, including flies and other arthropods. The presence of multiple species across different genera (e.g., *Argyrophylax*, *Stomoxys*, *Brontaea*) suggests a rich and varied ecosystem within the province. However, the data does not clarify whether these species are native to Fujian or introduced, nor does it specify their interactions with the local environment or human populations. The mention of \"\"732 HEYUAN HUI FLY\"\" appears to be a unique identifier or local name, as no standardized scientific nomenclature is provided for this entry.  \n\nThe descriptions are consistent in attributing all listed species to Fujian, with no direct contradictions. The entity \"\"FJIAN\"\" is resolved as a shorthand or misspelling of \"\"Fujian,\"\" aligning with the full name used in the majority of the descriptions. The summary synthesizes the information to reflect that Fujian hosts these species, emphasizing the province’s role in supporting their distribution. Further research would be needed to contextualize the ecological or economic importance of these species, as the data provided focuses solely on their geographic presence.  \n\nIn conclusion, Fujian, a Chinese province, is characterized by the distribution of **Argyrophylax phoeda**, **Argyrophylax nigrotibialis**, **Stomoxys sitiens**, **Melinda maai Kurahashi, 1970**, **Brontaea tonitrui**, and the **732 HEYUAN HUI FLY**, underscoring its status as a region of entomological interest. The lack of detailed biological or ecological context in the descriptions limits a deeper understanding of these species’ roles, but their presence collectively illustrates the province’s contribution to regional insect diversity.

This species is distinguished by the absence of a central light-colored powder stripe on the interfrontal area of the head, a key morphological feature differentiating it from related species. Males of *Stomoxys sitiens* exhibit a forehead width slightly less than 1/6 of the total head width, while females possess a single row of frontal bristles. The r4+5 vein in both sexes features a small bristle row that extends beyond the r-m cross vein, and the 2R5 cell’s opening width is less than half its maximum width. The tibiae (leg segments) are predominantly brown with yellow bases, and the overall body length ranges from 5 to 6 mm.  \n\nGeographically, *Stomoxys sitiens* is distributed across multiple regions, including Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, Hainan, Hong Kong, Guangxi, and Yunnan in China, as well as Thailand, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Egypt, Ethiopia (its type locality), and West Africa. This wide range suggests adaptability to diverse climates and habitats.  \n\nEcologically, the larvae of *Stomoxys sitiens* develop in cow dung or mixtures of horse manure and straw, indicating a preference for organic substrates rich in decomposing material. Adult flies, however, are hematophagous, with a specific preference for feeding on the blood of donkeys and camels, though they may also target other equids or ungulates. This dietary specialization aligns with the species’ role as a potential vector of pathogens in livestock and equine populations.  \n\nThe species’ taxonomic history is anchored in its original description by Rondani in 1873, with subsequent records confirming its presence in both Old and New World regions. Its morphological traits, such as the absence of the interfrontal stripe and specific venation patterns, are critical for identification within the *Stomoxys* genus, which includes other economically significant biting flies.  \n\nIn summary, *Stomoxys sitiens* is a small, blood-feeding fly with distinct physical characteristics, a broad geographic distribution spanning Asia, Africa, and parts of the Middle East, and a life cycle tied to equine and bovine hosts. Its ecological niche and morphological features make it a notable subject in entomological and veterinary studies.\",8\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n6799,HEMIPYRELLIA,SICHUAN,\"Hemipyrellia is distributed in Sichuan, China\",207\n4125,STOMOXYS CALCITRANS,LINNAEUS,\"\n\n**Stomoxys calcitrans**, commonly known as the stable fly, is a species of biting fly within the family Muscidae. It was first described by the Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician **Carl Linnaeus** in 1758. Linnaeus, often regarded as the father of modern taxonomy, established the binomial nomenclature system, and his work on classifying insects remains foundational in entomology. The stable fly is notable for its role as a pest, particularly in agricultural settings, where it feeds on the blood of livestock and can transmit pathogens. Its scientific name, *Stomoxys calcitrans*, reflects its taxonomic classification and historical significance in biological nomenclature. Linnaeus’s description of the species in 1758 marked a pivotal moment in its formal identification, enabling subsequent research into its ecology, behavior, and control. The fly is distinguished from other similar species by its preference for biting mammals, including humans, and its impact on animal health and productivity. Despite the brevity of the original descriptions, the attribution to Linnaeus underscores the species’ long-standing recognition in scientific literature.
