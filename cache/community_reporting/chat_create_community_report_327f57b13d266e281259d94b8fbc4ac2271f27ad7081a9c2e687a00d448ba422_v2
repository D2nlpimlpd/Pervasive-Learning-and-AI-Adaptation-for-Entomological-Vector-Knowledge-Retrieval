Key areas include Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, the Ryukyu Islands (e.g., Okinawa, Tokunoshima), Ogasawara Islands, Amami-Oshima, Yakushima, and smaller islands like Namiu House and Miyako Islands. Notable species found in Japan include *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum*, and *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, which are distributed across Hokkaido and Honshu. The Ryukyu Islands host *Musca convexifrons*, *Stomoxys uruma* (type locality), and *Ph. katoi*, while the Ogasawara Islands and southwestern islands are mentioned for *Chrysomya pinguis* and *Goniophyto* species. Hokkaido is specifically noted for *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Pegomya criniventris* (type locality), and *Chionomyia vetula* (studied by Kato and Suwa). \n\nJapan is also home to multiple *Pegohylemyia* species, including *P. tridentifera*, *P. nigrigenis*, and *P. pseudomaculipes*, with type localities in Hokkaido and Honshu. The genus *Pegomya* includes *P. japonica* and *P. winthemi*, while *Pegoplata palposa* and *P. virginea* are found in Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. Other species like *Fannia bisetosa*, *Fannia kowarzi*, *Coelomyia subpellucens*, and *Fannia difficilis* are distributed across the country. The Ryukyu Islands and Honshu are key for *Sarcophaga haematodes*, *Parasarcophaga polystylata*, and *Parasarcophaga albiceps*. \n\nInternational and foreign distribution references highlight Japan as a site for species such as *Nupedia fulva*, *Adia* genus, *Scathophaga mellipes* (type locality), and *Heteronychia abramovi*. Studies by researchers like Ishijima, Kato, and Suwa have contributed to understanding these distributions, particularly in regions like Tokyo, Okutama, and Shiyuan Island. Japan hosts multiple genera and species, including *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*, *Compsilura concinnata*, *Macronychia striginervis*, *Macronychia polyodon*, *Meliniella* spp., *Metopia leucocephala*, *Mydaea setifemur*, *Nemoraea pellucida* (Hatspo), and *Xanthotryxus mongol*. \n\nThe country is also associated with specific ecological interactions, such as *Strobilomyia laricicola* affecting *Larix* species and *Lasiomma curtigena* in Honshu. Notable records include *1431家蚕追寄蝇* (likely a parasitic fly), *Phylloteles pictipennis*, *Lispe patellitarsis*, *Lispe sinica*, and *1339上海细麻蝇* (Honshu). Additionally, Japan is the type locality for *Muscina japonica*, *Muscina angustifrons*, and *Calliphora nigribarbis*. \n\nThe diversity of fly species in Japan reflects its varied geography and ecosystems, with studies from 1950 to 1974 (e.g., Kato, Suwa) and modern taxonomic keys (e.g., Sarcophagini) underscoring its significance in entomological research. Overlapping distributions of genera like *Phaonia* (*fuscitibia*, *luteovittata*), *Lasiopelta*, *Vibrissina*, and *Nemorilla* further emphasize Japan’s role as a hub for both native and internationally distributed fly populations.
