Active primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, SUWA described numerous species and genera, including the genus *Meliniella* in 1974, with its type species *Meliniella sikisima*, and the genus *Shakshainia*, introducing the species *Shakshainia rametoka*. Their work on *Pegohylemyia* is notable, as they documented multiple species such as *Pegohylemyia tridentifera* (1986), *Pegohylemyia spinisternata* (1974), *Pegohylemyia nigrigenis*, *Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes*, and *Pegohylemyia maculipedella* in publications like the *Insect Research Journal* and *Chinese Economic Insect Monograph*. SUWA also described *Pegomya japonica* (1974), *Pegomya nigra* (1974), and its subspecies *Pegomya japonica mokanensis*, alongside *Hydrophoria montana* (1970) and *Phorbia pilostyla* (1977). \n\nIn addition to species descriptions, SUWA contributed to understanding host plant associations and geographic distributions of flies, including *Pegomya* species, and was cited in works related to *Phorbia fascicularis* in Japan. They also documented *Delia karasawana* (1974) and *Delia takizawai* (1974), as well as *Hylemya nigrimana* and *Hylemya femoralis*. SUWA’s research extended to *Chionomyia vetula* (1974) and *Paraprosalpia silvatica* (1974), with the latter being described twice in the data. Their work often appeared in Japanese entomological literature, reflecting a focus on regional biodiversity. \n\nThe entity’s name is associated with both scientific and Chinese vernacular species names, such as 黄跗粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya melatrochanter*), 喜马拉雅粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya criniventris*), 东方粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya nigra*), and 长板粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya japonica mokanensis*), as well as 亚山花蝇 (*Hyporites shakshain*). SUWA’s legacy includes foundational taxonomic studies that remain referenced in subsequent research on fly distributions and ecology. Their work in 1974 was particularly prolific, establishing multiple genera and species, while their 1970 and 1977 studies expanded on host plant interactions and regional faunal records.
