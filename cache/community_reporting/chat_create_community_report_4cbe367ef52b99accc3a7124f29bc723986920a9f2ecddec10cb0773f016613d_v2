Notably, New York is the type locality for this species, which means it was first identified and described from specimens collected there. This connection to New York is significant as it provides a historical and geographic reference point for the species. The presence of *Pegomya rubivora* in multiple continents also reflects the global reach of Coquillett’s entomological work and the ecological diversity of the species [Data: Entities (1447), Relationships (9, 2252, 2253)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"The genus *Opsolasia* and its taxonomic contribution\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The genus *Opsolasia* was described by Coquillett in 1910 and is part of the Mydaeinae subfamily. This taxonomic contribution is an important part of the community, as it represents a broader classification effort beyond individual species. The description of *Opsolasia* adds to the understanding of the evolutionary and ecological relationships among flies in the Mydaeinae subfamily. Coquillett’s work on this genus, like his work on other species, contributes to the historical record of entomological research and provides a framework for future studies [Data: Entities (2582), Relationships (4522)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Historical and regional focus of Coquillett’s work\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Coquillett’s work spans both regional and international insect species.

At the same time, his descriptions of species found in Asia and other regions demonstrate a broader interest in global entomology.
