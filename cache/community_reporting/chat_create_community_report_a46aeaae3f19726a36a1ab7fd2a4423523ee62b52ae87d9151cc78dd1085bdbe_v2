Multiple **Helina** species, such as **Helina calceataeformis**, **Helina quadrum**, **Helina hirtifemorata**, **Helina hengshanensis**, and **Helina obscuratoides**, are also reported in Shanxi, particularly in the Yanbei region.  \n\nThe province hosts a range of **Phaonia** species, including **Phaonia graciloides**, **Phaonia vulpinus**, **Phaonia submontana**, **Phaonia xingxianensis**, **Phaonia wenshuiensis**, **Phaonia yanggaoensis**, **Phaonia longifurca**, **Phaonia fuscata**, **Phaonia xiangningensis**, **Phaonia youyuensis**, and **Phaonia datongensis**, with specific localities like Lin County (for 类绒粪泉蝇) and Ying County, Hanyuan (for **Phaonia mimofausta**). **Coenosia** species such as **Coenosia dilatitarsis**, **Coenosia mollicula**, **Coenosia incisurata**, and **Coenosia strigipes** are found in Shanxi, alongside **Hydrotaea bimaculatoides** and **Hydrotaea occulta**. **Leucophora shanxiensis** and **Leucophora personata** are native to the region, with **Leucophora dorsalis** specifically recorded in Taiyuan.  \n\nShanxi is also home to **Mydaea discimana** and **Mydaea laxidetrita**, **Fannia scalaris**, **Fannia similis**, **Calliphora nigribarbis**, **Muscina assimilis** (in Xingxian), **Muscidae species** like **Musca bezzii**, **Musca conducens**, **Musca tempestiva**, and **Musca autumnalis**, as well as **Cynomyiomima stackelbergi** and **Cynomya mortuorum**. Notable localities include Nanmifan, Huanglongshan, Ziwuling, and the Qinling Mountains, where species such as **Kramerea schuetzei**, **Pseudonupedia intersecta** (in Taiyuan), and **Paregle densibarbata** are found. The genus **Nupedia** (e.g., **Nupedia aestiva**, **Nupedia patellans**, **Nupedia infirma**) and **Adia** are documented in the province, as are **Lydella grisescens**, **Phorbia securis xibeina** (type locality at Nanmewan, though this may refer to Shaanxi), and **Xenotachina fumifemoralis**.  \n\nShanxi’s entomological significance is further highlighted by the presence of **Parasarcophaga polystylata**, **Phaonia longifurca**, **Paraprosalpia tibialis**, **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, and **SHUANG YANGYING**, alongside species like **Anthomyia procellaris**, **Atherigona biseta**, **Bellardia menechmoides**, and **Bercaea cruentata**.

These should be corrected to reflect Shanxi’s distinct ecological profile. The province’s role as a hub for species like **Cuphocera varia**, **Delia longitheca**, and **1278靴折麻蝇** underscores its importance in biodiversity studies.  \n\nIn summary, Shanxi is a critical region in China for the distribution of diverse fly species, with specific localities and genera contributing to its entomological richness.

The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the specific geographic location where a species is first discovered and described, making Hanzhong a critical site for taxonomic research related to these organisms. While the descriptions provided emphasize Hanzhong's role in the context of these species, they all consistently identify it as a city within Shaanxi Province, China.
