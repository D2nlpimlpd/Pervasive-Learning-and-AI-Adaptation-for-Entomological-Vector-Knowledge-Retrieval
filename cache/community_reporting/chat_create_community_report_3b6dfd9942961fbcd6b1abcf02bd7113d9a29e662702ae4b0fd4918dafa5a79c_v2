It is characterized by the larviposition type, where females lay eggs directly on or near the host, and by specific morphological features such as bristle patterns and wing structures. These traits are consistent across its tribes, making Tachininae a key taxonomic reference point. The subfamily's role in entomology and its ecological significance as parasitoid flies are well established.

Ernestiini, on the other hand, is characterized by developed labella, four postnotal bristles, and the absence of notaular features. These differences help in the classification and study of the subfamily's biodiversity. The presence of multiple tribes under Tachininae indicates a well-defined taxonomic structure and highlights the subfamily's ecological and evolutionary diversity.
