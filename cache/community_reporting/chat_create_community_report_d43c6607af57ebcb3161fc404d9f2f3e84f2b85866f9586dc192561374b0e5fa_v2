STR.),Metopia (s. str.) is a subgenus of the genus Metopia with distinct features like a narrow median front and silvery-white powder on the head,5\n4545,ROHNDENDORF,\"\n\nROHNDENDORF was a taxonomist known for their significant contributions to the classification and description of insect species, particularly within the genus *Metopia*. In 1937, they authored the formal descriptions of two species: *1339上海细麻蝇* (Shanghai *Metopia* species 1339) and *1341细角细麻蝇* (Fine-horned *Metopia* species 1341), which expanded the taxonomic understanding of this group. These descriptions, published in the same year, provided foundational morphological and ecological insights into the species, aiding subsequent research in entomology.  \n\nLater, in 1955, ROHNDENDORF further advanced the study of *Metopia* by dividing the genus into two subgenera. This taxonomic revision reflected their recognition of distinct evolutionary or morphological lineages within the group, offering a more nuanced framework for categorizing related species. The reclassification likely addressed ambiguities in the genus's structure, improving clarity for scientists working on *Metopia* and its relatives.  \n\nROHNDENDORF’s work in both 1937 and 1955 demonstrates a sustained focus on refining the taxonomy of flies, particularly those within the *Metopia* genus. Their early species descriptions and later subgeneric division highlight their role in systematizing knowledge of these insects, which are often studied for their ecological roles or as model organisms in biological research. While the specific details of the subgenera established in 1955 are not provided, the act of splitting the genus suggests a meticulous approach to identifying and categorizing taxonomic diversity.  \n\nThe entity’s contributions span two decades, indicating a long-term engagement with entomological taxonomy. The 1937 descriptions of *1339上海细麻蝇* and *1341细角细麻蝇* likely included geographic and morphological data, as implied by the Chinese names (which may denote regional or species-specific characteristics). The 1955 revision, meanwhile, underscores their analytical rigor in addressing broader phylogenetic relationships. Together, these achievements position ROHNDENDORF as a key figure in the historical development of *Metopia* taxonomy, bridging species-level documentation with higher-level classification.  \n\nNo contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both pertain to ROHNDENDORF’s taxonomic work on *Metopia*. The summary integrates their 1937 species-level contributions and 1955 subgeneric reorganization, emphasizing their dual role as both a describer of individual species and a classifier of broader taxonomic groups. This synthesis captures the entity’s legacy in advancing the scientific understanding of *Metopia* and related taxa.\",4\n5081,1341细角细麻蝇,\"A species of fly described by Rohdendorf in 1937, with features like a slender horn and specific tail structures.

It serves as the **type locality** for the species *Delia pectinitibia*, a fly species first described and identified in this region, establishing its scientific importance as the reference point for taxonomic classification. Additionally, Wenxian is documented as a **survey location** for the species *1341细角细麻蝇* (a Chinese fly species, likely *Chrysomya pinguis* or a similar name based on the numerical identifier), where 1341 surveys have been conducted to study its distribution and ecological patterns. The county also functions as a **distribution site** for *1352 Lingulate Pierretia Fly* (possibly *Pierretia lingulata* or a related species), further highlighting its role in the biodiversity of Gansu. \n\nWhile one description refers to Wenxian as a \"\"city,\"\" the majority of the data and standard administrative classifications identify it as a **county**, resolving the minor contradiction in terminology. As a county, Wenxian is part of the broader Gansu administrative framework and has been central to multiple entomological investigations. Its association with these three distinct fly species underscores its ecological relevance, particularly in understanding the habitats and ranges of insects in the region. The repeated mention of Wenxian as a site for surveys and species distribution suggests it is a focal area for scientific research, possibly due to its unique environmental conditions or historical significance in taxonomic studies. \n\nIn summary, Wenxian, Gansu, is a key location in China for entomology, serving as the type locality for *Delia pectinitibia* and a critical site for the distribution and study of *1341细角细麻蝇* and *1352 Lingulate Pierretia Fly*.
