The province is home to a wide array of flies, including **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Eutrichota inornata**, **Helina calceataeformis**, **Helina quadrum**, **Lydella grisescens**, **Phryxe vulgaris**, **Musca autumnalis**, **Platymyia hortulana**, **Zenillia dolosa**, **Calliphora nigribarbis**, **Chionomyia vetula**, **Graphomya rufitibia** (Hanzhong), **Lispe monochaita**, **Musca bezzii**, **Voria ruralis**, **I. tripartita**, **Polleniopsis mongolica**, and **Parasarcophaga polystylata**. Multiple **Helina** species, such as **Helina hirtifemorata**, **Helina hengshanensis**, and **Helina obscuratoides**, are also reported, alongside **Coenosia** species like **Coenosia dilatitarsis**, **Coenosia mollicula**, **Coenosia incisurata**, and **Coenosia strigipes**.  \n\nShanxi hosts several **Phaonia** species, including **Phaonia datongensis**, **Phaonia submontana**, **Phaonia vulpinus**, **Phaonia graciloides**, **Phaonia xingxianensis**, **Phaonia wenshuiensis**, **Phaonia yanggaoensis**, **Phaonia fuscata**, **Phaonia longifurca**, **Phaonia xiangningensis**, and **Phaonia youyuensis**, with specific localities like Xingxian, Ying County, and Hanyuan noted. The province is a key distribution area for **Hydrotaea bimaculatoides** and **Hydrotaea occulta**, as well as **Hydrophoria megaloba** and other **Hydrophoria** species. Notable species include **Leucophora shanxiensis** (type locality in Taiyuan), **Leucophora personata**, **Leucophora dorsalis** (Taiyuan), **Lispe loewi**, **Paraprosalpia tibialis**, **Pseudonupedia intersecta** (Taiyuan), **Nupedia aestiva**, **Nupedia patellans**, **Nupedia infirma**, and **Haematobia**.  \n\nShanxi’s Yanbei region is highlighted for **Helina calceataeformis** and **Helina quadrum**, while Lin County is associated with **类绒粪泉蝇** (likely *Musca conducens* or a related species). The province also includes **Cuphocera varia**, **Delia longitheca**, **Egle cyrtacra** (type locality at Jinci, Taiyuan), **Fannia similis**, **Fannia scalaris**, **Muscina assimilis** (Xingxian), **Servaisia rossica**, **Sarcophaga erythrura**, **Stomorhina obsoleta**, **Xenotachina fumifemoralis**, **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, **Cynomyiomima stackelbergi**, and **Cynomya mortuorum**. Specific localities such as Nanmifan, Huanglongshan, Ziwuling, and Qinling are mentioned for various species, including **Phorbia securis xibeina** (type locality at Nanmewan, Yan’an) and **SHUANG YANGYING** (exact species unclear).  \n\nThe province has been surveyed for entomological species by institutions like the **Shanxi Medical College**, with records of **Adia** genus, **732 HEYUAN HUI FLY**, **1278靴折麻蝇**, **1279膨端折麻蝇**, and **1351 Microspine Pierretia Fly**. It is also noted for **Mydaea discimana**, **Mydaea laxidetrita**, and **Calythea cheni**. Contradictory references to **Shaanxi** (e.g., *Calliphora axata* in Xi’an, Hanzhong) are likely errors, as the entity in focus is **Shanxi**. The province’s cities, including **Taiyuan**, **Xian** (corrected to Xi’an in Shaanxi), and **Hanzhong** (also in Shaanxi), are frequently cited in distribution data, though some entries may conflate Shanxi with neighboring provinces.  \n\nIn summary, Shanxi is a significant region in China for the study of fly biodiversity, with documented distributions of over 40 species across genera such as *Phaonia*, *Helina*, *Hydrotaea*, and *Coenosia*. Key areas like Taiyuan, Yan’an, and Changzhi are central to these records, and the province’s ecological surveys highlight its role in entomological research.

This taxonomic group is characterized by distinct morphological features that aid in its identification. Notably, members of the genus exhibit **mostly bare eyes**, a trait that differentiates them from other related genera. In males, a defining characteristic is the **narrow forehead**, which contributes to their unique appearance. Additionally, the genus is distinguished by specific anatomical traits in the **wings and abdomen**, though the exact nature of these features is not detailed in the provided descriptions. As part of the Mydaeinae subfamily, *Mydaea* species are likely to share broader taxonomic and ecological traits with other members of this group, which includes small to medium-sized flies often associated with decaying organic matter or specific host environments. The combination of these physical attributes and subfamily classification provides a foundational understanding of *Mydaea* within the context of dipteran taxonomy. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, allowing for a unified summary that integrates all provided details.\",6\n2075,ZHANGJIAKOU,\"\n\nZhangjiakou is a city located in Hebei province, China.

As a city within Hebei, Zhangjiakou is part of the broader administrative and cultural framework of northern China, though specific details about its population, economy, or other characteristics are not provided in the given data. The mention of *Mydaea discimana*’s presence in Zhangjiakou aligns with the city’s role as a habitat or study area for this species, which may be relevant to entomological, agricultural, or environmental research. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as both confirm Zhangjiakou’s location in Hebei province while the first adds context about its association with *Mydaea discimana*.
