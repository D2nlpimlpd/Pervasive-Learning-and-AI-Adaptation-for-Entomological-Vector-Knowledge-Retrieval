Additionally, XINGLONG is identified as the domestic type locality for the *Xinglong flax fly* (*Hypopygiopsis infumata*), a term used in taxonomy to denote the specific geographic origin where a species is first formally described. The area’s association with these species highlights its role in biodiversity research and insect classification. While some descriptions emphasize its status as a city, others frame it as a sub-region, suggesting it may be a smaller administrative or ecological area within Hainan. The mention of \"\"flax fly\"\" in the Chinese description aligns with the broader context of fly species distribution, though the exact ecological or agricultural relevance of this association requires further clarification.
