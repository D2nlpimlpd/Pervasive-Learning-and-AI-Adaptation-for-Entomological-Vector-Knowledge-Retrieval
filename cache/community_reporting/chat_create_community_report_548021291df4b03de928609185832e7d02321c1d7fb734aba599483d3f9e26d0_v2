The province is home to *Helina sexmaculata*, a species in the genus *Helina* (family Sarcophagidae), and the moth *Prodenia litura* (commonly known as the armyworm or corn earworm, family Noctuidae). Notably, Hunan is also connected to the term \"\"Xinhui,\"\" though this may refer to a specific locality, research context, or misattribution, as Xinhui is a city in Guangdong Province. The data collectively highlight Hunan’s role as a significant region for entomological biodiversity, particularly for parasitic flies and lepidopteran species, which may have ecological or agricultural relevance due to their interactions with pests like the pine caterpillar. All species mentioned are native to China, with Hunan’s varied ecosystems supporting their habitats. The summary integrates both Chinese and English nomenclature where applicable, ensuring clarity while maintaining the original entity names for context.\",6\n5486,江苏林科所,\"Jiangsu Forestry Research Institute, associated with the entity �蛾 and researcher Jiang Yongjun\",2\n5487,江永俊,Researcher at Jiangsu Forestry Research Institute linked to �蛾 studies,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10887,1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇,辽宁,\"1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇 is distributed in Liaoning, China\",52\n3627,MUSCA VENTROSA,WIEDEMANN,Wiedemann described the species *Musca ventrosa* in 1830,42\n6621,ENC.ENT.,江苏,The journal lists Jiangsu as a distribution location for Lucilia hainanensis,37\n10900,1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇,黑龙江,\"1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇 is distributed in Heilongjiang, China\",34\n8725,北京,拉氏麻野蝇,The species *Sarcophila rasnitzyni* is distributed in Beijing,26\n10912,1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇,北京,\"1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇 is distributed in Beijing, China\",26\n5505,广东,\"TIJDSCHR.ENT,, 47: 105(♀)(SPILOGASTER)\",This publication describes a species found in Guangdong,20\n10937,梁恩义,北京,梁恩义 documented the parasitism of Calpe capucina in Beijing,18\n3629,MUSCA VENTROSA,福建,The species *Musca ventrosa* is distributed in Fujian Province,17\n3631,MUSCA VENTROSA,海南,The species *Musca ventrosa* is distributed in Hainan Province,13\n3632,MUSCA VENTROSA,广西,The species *Musca ventrosa* is distributed in Guangxi Province,13\n5522,湖南,\"SAMPL.
