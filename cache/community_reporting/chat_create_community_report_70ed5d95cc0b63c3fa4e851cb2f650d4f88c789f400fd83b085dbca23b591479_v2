This species is distinguished by a combination of morphological characteristics that aid in its identification. Notably, it exhibits specific abdominal plate coloration, a feature highlighted in its original description. Additionally, the bristle patterns on the hind femur are a key diagnostic trait, though the exact configuration is not detailed in the provided data. Another defining feature is the presence of a large submedian anterior ventral bristle on the middle tibia, which further differentiates it from closely related species. While the term \"\"housefly\"\" is used in one description, it is important to clarify that *Musca crassirostris* is a distinct species within the *Musca* genus, which includes the common housefly (*Musca domestica*). The morphological traits described—particularly the bristle patterns and abdominal coloration—serve as critical markers for taxonomic classification and differentiation. These features collectively contribute to the species' unique identity in entomological studies. The descriptions provided are consistent in attributing the species to Stein and emphasizing its morphological distinctiveness, with no direct contradictions to resolve.

Additionally, XINGLONG is identified as the domestic type locality for the *Xinglong flax fly* (*Hypopygiopsis infumata*), a term used in taxonomy to denote the specific geographic origin where a species is first formally described. The area’s association with these species highlights its role in biodiversity research and insect classification. While some descriptions emphasize its status as a city, others frame it as a sub-region, suggesting it may be a smaller administrative or ecological area within Hainan. The mention of \"\"flax fly\"\" in the Chinese description aligns with the broader context of fly species distribution, though the exact ecological or agricultural relevance of this association requires further clarification. Overall, XINGLONG serves as an important reference point in studies related to these insect species, underscoring its value in understanding regional entomological patterns.

These species are part of the broader ecological context of Tongshi, which is described as a location where they are present. Additionally, Tongshi is identified as an area within Hainan where *Musca crassirostris*, a species of fly, is distributed. While some descriptions refer to Tongshi as a \"\"region\"\" or \"\"area,\"\" the most consistent and specific designation across the data is that it is a city in Hainan. This aligns with the administrative and geographical framework of Hainan, where cities and regions often overlap in classification. The mention of multiple species highlights Tongshi’s role as a habitat or study site for entomological research, particularly for these fly species. The data does not present direct contradictions but rather varying levels of specificity in describing Tongshi’s geographical and ecological significance. In summary, Tongshi is a city in Hainan, China, notable for its connection to the distribution of *611扁蹠芒蝇*, *614裸蹠芒蝇*, and *Musca crassirostris*, underscoring its importance in regional biodiversity studies.

While one description refers to it as a \"\"city,\"\" this likely reflects a broader or colloquial understanding of the term, as Hainan is home to several administrative divisions, including cities like Sanya and Haikou, but Baisha itself is more accurately characterized as a district or town within the province. Its significance lies in its ecological relevance to *Musca crassirostris*, a species of fly whose habitat and range are studied in entomological contexts. The mention of Baisha in relation to this species highlights its role as a regional point of interest for biodiversity research, though no further details about the local environment or specific studies conducted there are provided in the data. The entity remains primarily defined by its geographical association with Hainan and its connection to the distribution of *Musca crassirostris*.\",1\n4361,STRONGYLONEURA DIPLOURA,,1\n5615,ZHANG BAOLIN,A scientist who documented the presence of Pseudogonia rufifrons in Hainan in 1963,1\n5631,CARCELIAS KOCKIANA,\"A species of fly (Carcelia kockiana) described by Townsend in 1927, characterized by specific morphological features such as 1:1 abdominal setae, black wing scutellum, and a distribution in China (Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Beijing, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, Hainan, Guangxi, Yunnan) and abroad (Japan, Indonesia, Africa). Hosts include Busseola fusca, Clostera tristis, and Heliothis armigera in Yunnan.\",23\n3692,HEMIPYRELLIA,\"Hemipyrellia is a genus of flies with metallic green bodies and specific morphological features, distributed across Africa, East Asia, and Australia\",22\n2853,CARICEA BOOPS,\"\n\n**CARICEA BOOPS** is a species of fly first described by the entomologist **Thomson in 1869**. The species is characterized by its **red-yellow body features**, including **red-yellow legs and antennae** as noted in one source, while another description specifies a **body length of 4 mm**. These physical traits suggest a distinct coloration pattern that may aid in identification within its habitats.  \n\nRegarding its distribution, there is a notable discrepancy between the two descriptions. One source states that *Caricea boops* is found in **Taiwan (Tainan), Guangdong (coastal islands), India, and Indonesia**, regions spanning East and Southeast Asia. The other description claims its distribution is in **Europe**, which conflicts with the Asian range. This contradiction could arise from taxonomic confusion, regional misreporting, or the possibility that the species has a broader geographic range than previously documented. Further research or verification of regional records may be necessary to resolve this inconsistency.  \n\nThe species’ name and classification remain consistent across both descriptions, with **Thomson (1869)** cited as the original describer. While the first source emphasizes specific anatomical features (legs and antennae), the second provides a more general reference to red-yellow body coloration. Combining these details, *Caricea boops* appears to exhibit a striking red-yellow hue across multiple body parts, with a compact size of 4 mm.  \n\nIn summary, *Caricea boops* is a 4 mm-long fly species described in 1869, noted for its red-yellow coloration. Its distribution is reported in **Asia** (Taiwan, Guangdong, India, Indonesia) and **Europe**, though the overlap or validity of the European range remains unclear. The species’ physical traits and geographic presence highlight the need for updated taxonomic studies to reconcile conflicting data and confirm its true range.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",11\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10114,兴隆亚麻蝇,FAN,FAN于1964年首次描述了兴隆亚麻蝇,301\n2779,ZHI BEN SHAN,YUNNAN,Zhiben Mountain is located in Yunnan,161\n842,TAIWAN,ECONOMIC INSECTS OF CHINA,The Economic Insects of China publication documents fly species found in Taiwan,156\n3615,MUSCA CRASSIROSTRIS,STEIN,\"\n\n**MUSCA CRASSIROSTRIS** is a species of fly that was first described by the entomologist **STEIN** in 1903. The species name, *Musca crassirostris*, follows standard taxonomic conventions, with the genus *Musca* and the specific epithet *crassirostris* indicating its classification within the family Muscidae. Stein, a notable figure in the field of dipterology, contributed to the formal identification and documentation of this species, establishing its scientific recognition. The description of *Musca crassirostris* by Stein provides foundational taxonomic information, including morphological characteristics and ecological context, which are critical for subsequent studies and classifications of the species. While the provided data does not include additional details about the species' habitat, behavior, or distribution, it confirms Stein's role as the original describer, a key point in understanding the species' taxonomic history. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as both consistently attribute the 1903 description to Stein.
