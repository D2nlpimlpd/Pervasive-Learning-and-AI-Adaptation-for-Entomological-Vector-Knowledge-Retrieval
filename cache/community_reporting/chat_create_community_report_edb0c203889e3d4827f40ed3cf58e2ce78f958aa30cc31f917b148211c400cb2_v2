DENG is recognized as a co-author of the 1981 description of *Hydrophoria megaloba* and the 1987 description of *Helina dibrachiata*. Additionally, DENG co-described *宽角阳蝇* (a species name not fully translated into scientific nomenclature) in 1987. Collaborations with Fang and Li are highlighted in multiple works, including the co-description of *Phaonia subemarginata* and *Phorbia hypandrium*. DENG also co-authored the description of *Eutrichota bilobella* (Li et Deng) and *Helina inflata*, though the specific year for the latter is not provided.  \n\nIn the genus *Pegomya*, DENG is the primary author of several species, including *Pegomya folifera*, *Pegomya tenuiramula*, *Pegomya hamatacrophalla*, *Pegomya angusticerca*, *Pegomya simpliciforceps*, *Pegomya flaviprecoxa*, *Pegomya nudapicalis*, and *Pegomya melatrochanter*. Notably, *Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis* is listed as a subspecies under *Pegomya*, suggesting DENG’s work spans both species and subspecies-level taxonomy. DENG further co-authored the description of *Pegohylemyia sichuanensis* (Sichuan Spring Fly) with Li, and is credited as the sole author of *Pegohylemyia emeisencio* (峨泽菊泉种蝇), a species named in Chinese.  \n\nDENG’s work with Li extends to other genera, such as *Phorbia hypandrium* and *Eutrichota bilobella*, underscoring a recurring partnership in taxonomic research.

This indicates a dual role as both a primary author and collaborator.  \n\nDENG’s publications span multiple decades, with documented work from 1981 to at least 1987. The researcher’s focus on diverse fly genera reflects a broad expertise in dipteran taxonomy. All descriptions are presented without contradictions, as the data consistently attributes DENG as either a primary author or co-author across species and genera.

Notably, *Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis* and *Pegomya folifera* are explicitly cited as having E’Mei Mountain as their type locality in two separate descriptions, reinforcing its role in the taxonomic history of these species. The mountain is also the type locality for *Phorbia perssoni* and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, further underscoring its importance in entomological research. Additionally, E’Mei Mountain is associated with *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis*, a species within the blowfly family, though the exact nature of this association (e.g., type locality or simply presence) is not specified in the descriptions. Beyond these, the site is home to *Silbomyia hoeneana*, which is distributed in the region but not explicitly noted as a type locality. The repeated emphasis on E’Mei Mountain as a type locality for multiple *Pegomya* species and others highlights its ecological and scientific value as a hub for biodiversity and taxonomic studies. The descriptions collectively confirm the mountain’s role in the discovery and documentation of these species, with no contradictions in the data provided.
