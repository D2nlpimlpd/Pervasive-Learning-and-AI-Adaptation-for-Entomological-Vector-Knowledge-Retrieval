(Word count: 120)\",11\n737,WIEDEMANN,\"\n\n**WIEDEMANN** was a German entomologist and taxonomist active in the 19th century, renowned for his significant contributions to the classification of insect species. His work spanned multiple genera and families, with notable descriptions of species across various years. In **1817**, he described *Thricops semicinereus*. By **1819**, Wiedemann had documented *Gonia bimaculata* and *Bengalia (Anisomyia) torosa* (侧线孟蝇), the latter being a Chinese species. In **1820**, he named *Stomorhina xanthogaster*. His 1824 publications included *Brontaea tonitrui*, *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, *Gonia chinensis*, and *Limnophora exigua*, the latter of which he also described as the original author.  \n\nWiedemann’s most prolific period appears to have been **1830**, during which he described numerous species. These include *Stomorhina obsoleta* and *Stomorhina melastoma*, *Pseudogonia rufifrons*, *Musca lauta* (later reclassified as *Neomyia (Scutellorthellia) lauta*), *Lispe orientalis* and *Lispe leucospila*, *Musca cornicina*, *Myospila bina*, *Musca ventrosa* and *Musca planiceps*, *Musca chalybea*, *Exorista sorbillans*, *Oestrus maculatus* (now *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina*), and *Dichaetomyia bibax*. Additionally, he was associated with the mode species of *Craspedochoeta* and *Sisyropa thermophila*.  \n\nEarlier in his career, Wiedemann also described *Isomyia viridaurea* and *Ophyra leucostoma* and *Ophyra chalcogaster*, the latter two being linked to his work on blowflies. His 1824 contributions extended to *Hydrophoria conica*, though the exact year for this species is unspecified in some sources. In 1830, he further expanded his taxonomic work by documenting six *Atherigona* species, including 611扁蹠芒蝇 and 612黄髭芒蝇, though the full scientific names for these remain in Chinese.  \n\nWiedemann’s legacy includes resolving nomenclatural complexities, such as the reclassification of *Musca lauta* into *Neomyia lauta* and *Oestrus maculatus* into *Lucilia cuprina*. He also served as the collector of the *Sarcophaga haematodes* specimen, highlighting his role in specimen curation. Despite some inconsistencies in the data—such as conflicting years for *Morellia hortensia* (1824 vs. 1830) and *Hydrophoria conica*—his work remains foundational in entomology, particularly for dipteran taxonomy. His descriptions of species like *Lispe orientalis* and *Lispe leucospila* (1830), *Gonia chinensis* (1824), and *Stomorhina xanthogaster* (1820) underscore his meticulous approach to documenting biodiversity.  \n\nOverall, Wiedemann’s career reflects a dedication to systematic entomology, with his 1830 publications being especially influential. His efforts in naming and reclassifying species, alongside his role in collecting specimens, solidified his reputation as a key figure in 19th-century insect taxonomy. The contradictions in the data, such as the dual years for *Morellia hortensia*, may stem from overlapping descriptions or subsequent taxonomic revisions, but his primary contributions remain well-documented and widely recognized.\",36\n2961,BRONTAEA TONITRUI,\"Species of fly described by Wiedemann in 1824, with subspecies variegata and distribution in China and Southeast Asia\",8\n2734,LIMNOPHORA EXIGUA,\"A fly species with a 3.5x wider male frontal plate than antennae and abdominal markings, originally described by Wiedemann in 1830, distributed in Guizhou, Guangdong, Taiwan, and internationally in the Philippines, India, Myanmar, etc.\",7\n835,HYDROPHORIA CONICA,,2\n4194,TAIWAN (TAINAN),Tainan in Taiwan is a domestic location where Rhinia apicalis is found,2\n2615,AUSSEUR,Journal where Myospila bina was described,1\n4193,\"JINGGANGSHAN, JIANGXI\",Jinggangshan in Jiangxi is a domestic location where Rhinia apicalis is found,1\n4195,\"GUANGZHOU, GUANGDONG\",Guangzhou in Guangdong is a domestic location where Rhinia apicalis is found,1\n4196,\"JIANYANG, FUJIAN\",Jianyang in Fujian is a domestic location where Rhinia apicalis is found,1\n4216,STOMORHINA MELASTOMA,\"A species of fly described by Wiedemann in 1830, with a dark abdomen, yellow tibiae, and distinct bristle patterns.
