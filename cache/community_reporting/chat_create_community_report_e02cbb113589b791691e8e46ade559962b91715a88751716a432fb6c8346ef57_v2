It is also recognized as one of the distribution areas for the red-legged patterned fly (*Chrysomya rufifacies*), a species of blow fly commonly associated with forensic entomology and ecological studies. The region of Hanzhong, situated in the southern part of Shaanxi, is characterized by its strategic geographical position at the intersection of the Qinling Mountains and the Daba Mountains, serving as a key historical and cultural hub in western China. Known for its rich biodiversity, Hanzhong contributes to the ecological habitats where the red-legged patterned fly thrives, particularly in environments with warm, humid climates. The area has been historically significant as a transportation and trade route, linking northern and southern China, and is home to a mix of natural and cultural landmarks. The mention of the red-legged patterned fly in relation to Hanzhong highlights the region’s role in biological research, though specific ecological interactions or population dynamics of the species in this area are not detailed in the provided data. Overall, Hanzhong combines geographical, historical, and biological relevance within Shaanxi province.

As the administrative and cultural center of Shandong, Jinan is not only a major urban hub but also a noted habitat for this particular insect. The descriptions provided confirm that Jinan serves as one of the geographic sites where *Atherigona yiwulushan* is found, highlighting its ecological relevance in the region. The entity names and details are consistent across the sources, with no contradictions to resolve. This summary integrates the information from both the English and Chinese descriptions to present a unified account of Jinan’s role in relation to the species.\",1\n2689,青岛,\"\n\nQingdao (青岛) is a coastal city located in Shandong Province, China. It is recognized as one of the distribution areas for *Lucilia shenyangensis*, a species of blowfly commonly referred to as the red-legged blowfly. This association highlights Qingdao's ecological significance in the context of entomological studies, particularly regarding the geographic range and habitat of *Lucilia shenyangensis*. As a major port city on the Yellow Sea, Qingdao's climate and environment likely contribute to the presence and proliferation of this species, which is often studied for its role in forensic science and decomposition processes. The city itself is a key urban and economic hub in eastern China, known for its modern infrastructure, historical architecture, and vibrant tourism industry. Its coastal location and temperate climate further support diverse ecosystems, making it a notable site for biodiversity research. The mention of *Lucilia shenyangensis* in both the English and Chinese descriptions confirms the consistency of the information, with no contradictions to resolve. In summary, Qingdao is a coastal city in Shandong Province, China, distinguished by its role as a distribution site for the red-legged blowfly (*Lucilia shenyangensis*), alongside its broader cultural, economic, and environmental importance.\",1\n2691,安阳,安阳是河南省的地点，绯胫纹蝇的分布地之一,1\n2692,郑州,\"\n\n**Zhengzhou** is the capital city of **Henan Province**, China, and is recognized as a significant location in the distribution range of **Lucilia shenyangensis**, a species of blowfly. This entity is also associated with the Chinese name **绯胫纹蝇** (Fēijìng wén yíng), which directly translates to \"\"Chinese calliphora\"\" and is used to describe the same species. The city's ecological and geographical characteristics, as part of Henan Province, contribute to its role as a habitat for this insect, which is likely linked to local environmental conditions or research activities. Zhengzhou, as a major urban and administrative center in central China, serves as a focal point for studies on biodiversity and entomological distribution within the region. The mention of both the scientific and vernacular names underscores the importance of the city in entomological contexts, though no direct contradictions exist between the descriptions provided. The summary integrates the dual references to Zhengzhou’s status as a provincial capital and its connection to the species’ presence, ensuring clarity and coherence.
