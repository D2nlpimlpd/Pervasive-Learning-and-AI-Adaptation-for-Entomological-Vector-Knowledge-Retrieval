It was first described in the journal *Acta Zoologica Sinica* (volume 10, issue 3, page 289), with the same publication details also cited in the Chinese journal *动物分类学报* (Acta Zoologica Sinica) under the same volume and issue. The species is characterized by its distinctive silver-powdered frons (the area between the eyes on the head), a feature that likely contributes to its common name. Morphologically, *L. argentitriangula* has a body length of approximately 4.2 mm, as noted in the original description. The combination of its metallic coloration and specific anatomical traits, such as the triangular silver markings on the frons, distinguishes it from other members of the genus. The use of both the scientific name and the Chinese common name (*银三角池蝇*) reflects its taxonomic recognition in both international and regional entomological literature. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they align on the publication source, key physical attributes, and nomenclature. This species is part of the broader classification of flies, though further details on its ecological role, habitat, or behavior are not provided in the given data.\",3\n2705,XUE ET WANG,\"\n\nXUE ET WANG are researchers known for their contributions to the taxonomy of flies, particularly within the families Muscidae and Syrphidae. They described **Phaonia youyuensis**, a species in the genus *Phaonia*, though the specific journal or year for this description is not provided in the data. In 1985, they co-authored the description of **Limnophora argentitriangula**, a species in the genus *Limnophora*, which was published in the journal *动物分类学报* (Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica). Additionally, they described **Helina longiquadrata**, a member of the genus *Helina*, and **Helina spinicauda**, another *Helina* species, though the journals for these latter two are unspecified. \n\nXue and Wang also described two other *Phaonia* species: **Phaonia rufivulgaris**, published in *动物分类学报*, and **Phaonia huanrenensis**, which appeared in *昆虫分类学报* (Entomotaxonomia). These works highlight their expertise in classifying and documenting diverse fly species across different taxonomic groups and journals. Their research spans multiple publications, with *动物分类学报* and *昆虫分类学报* serving as key outlets for their findings. While the data does not clarify whether all these descriptions were published in the same year or distinct years (except for Limnophora argentitriangula in 1985), it collectively underscores their role in advancing the understanding of dipteran taxonomy.
