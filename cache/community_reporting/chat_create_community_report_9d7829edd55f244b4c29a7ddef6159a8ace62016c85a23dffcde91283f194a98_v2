The region is home to the **松毛虫缅麻蝇** (*Sarcophaga* sp.), a species associated with its ecological habitats. Additionally, Jiangsu hosts **Lucilia hainanensis**, a blowfly species known for its presence in subtropical and tropical environments. The province also serves as a key habitat for **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa**, a parasitic fly documented in Chinese entomological records. Furthermore, Jiangsu is explicitly noted as the domestic location for three specific species: **1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇** (*Chrysomya* sp. 1461), **1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇** (*Chrysomya* sp. 1463), and **1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇** (*Chrysomya* sp. 1464), which are likely part of a regional or taxonomic classification system. These species, while distinct in their biological characteristics, collectively highlight Jiangsu’s role in supporting diverse fly populations, particularly those with ecological or parasitic significance. The province’s climate, geography, and ecosystems appear to provide suitable conditions for these species to thrive, contributing to its prominence in Chinese entomological studies. No contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as all consistently identify Jiangsu as a distribution site for these species within China. The summary integrates all listed entities and their associated species, emphasizing Jiangsu’s ecological importance in the context of fly biodiversity.
