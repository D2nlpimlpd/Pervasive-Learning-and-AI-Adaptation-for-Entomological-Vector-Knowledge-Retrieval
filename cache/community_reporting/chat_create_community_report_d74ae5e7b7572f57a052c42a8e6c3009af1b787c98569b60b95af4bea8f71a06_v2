During this year, he first described the species *Blaesoxipha arenicola*, which is part of the Sarcophagidae family. Additionally, Rohdendorf documented *Chrysogramma variabile*, another member of the same family, alongside other Sarcophagidae species in his taxonomic work. These descriptions were pivotal in expanding the scientific understanding of flesh fly diversity and classification during the early 20th century. The year 1928 thus marks a key milestone in entomological research, as it reflects Rohdendorf’s role in formally identifying and categorizing multiple Sarcophagidae species, including *Blaesoxipha arenicola* and *Chrysogramma variabile*. His efforts in this period provided foundational insights for subsequent studies on the morphology, ecology, and evolutionary relationships of these insects. The concurrent documentation of these species underscores the productivity of his work in 1928, which likely involved detailed morphological analyses and comparisons to establish their distinct identities within the Sarcophagidae family. While the descriptions of *Blaesoxipha arenicola* and *Chrysogramma variabile* are highlighted as separate achievements, they are part of a broader taxonomic initiative by Rohdendorf to systematize knowledge of Sarcophagidae, a group known for its scavenging and parasitic behaviors. This year remains notable in the field of dipterology for consolidating multiple species-level discoveries under a single researcher’s expertise.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n8926,BLAESOXIPHA ARENICOLA,ROHDENDORF,Rohdendorf described Blaesoxipha arenicola in 1928,101\n8283,ROHDENDORF,1928,Rohdendorf published descriptions in 1928,96\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
