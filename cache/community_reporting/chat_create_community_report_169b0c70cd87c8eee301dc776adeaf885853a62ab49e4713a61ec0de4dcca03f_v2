It is known to occur in multiple geographic regions, including China, Europe, and North America. In China, its distribution has been documented in the northern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and Hebei, which are characterized by temperate climates and diverse ecosystems. The species is also present in Europe, with potential records in Germany, though its exact range across the continent remains less precisely defined. Additionally, **Hydrotaea bimaculata** has been reported in North America, indicating a transcontinental distribution. The fly’s presence in these regions suggests adaptability to a range of environmental conditions, though specific ecological preferences or behaviors are not detailed in the provided data.

It includes two subspecies: *cuprina cuprina* and *cuprina dorsalis*.\",9\n399,GERMANY,\"\n\nGermany, a European country, is a significant type locality and distribution site for numerous fly species across multiple genera. It serves as the type locality for **Phaonia incana**, **Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia**, **Pegoplata genus**, **PIERRETTIA NEMORALIS**, **PIERRETTIA CLATHRATA**, **Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum**, **Hylemya vagans**, **Pegohylemyia striolata**, **Pegomya exilis**, **Coenosia incisurata**, **Coenosia flavicornis**, **Paraprosalpia sepiella**, **Parasarcophaga uliginosa**, **Helina latitarsis**, **Leucosticta Fannia**, **Barbata Fannia**, **Lispe leucospila**, **Lispe consanguinea**, **Egle anthomyioides**, **Helina obscuratoides**, **Hydrophoria annulata**, **Thricops semicinereus**, **Pegomya seitenstellensis**, **Pseudonupedia intersecta**, **Polietes lardaria**, and **Calliphora rohdendorfi** (Enderlein, 1903). Additionally, Germany is associated with the type locality of **Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata** and **Pegomya geniculata**, though the latter’s connection is explicitly noted as a type locality in Europe.  \n\nThe country is also linked to the distribution of **Scathophaga suilla**, **Hydrotaea bimaculata**, **Hydrotaea occulta**, **Hydrotaea japonica** (as a possible type locality), and **Hydrotaea bimaculata** (as a possible type locality in Europe). Furthermore, Germany hosts the **毛踝厕蝇** (*Musca longisetosa*) and **尾须厕蝇** (*Musca caudata*), though these are described as foreign distribution locations. The genus **Hydrophoria annulata** is documented in Germany as a foreign region in Europe, while **Helicophagella genus** is noted as distributed in Germany as a foreign country.  \n\nGermany’s role as a type locality is highlighted for species such as **Pegomya exilis**, **Pseudonupedia intersecta** (in the Palaearctic region), and **Pegomya seitenstellensis**, underscoring its importance in entomological taxonomy. The species **teretirostris** and **Halina moedlingensis** are explicitly tied to Germany as their type localities. However, some entries present tentative associations, such as the potential type locality for **Hydrotaea bimaculata** and **Hydrotaea occulta**, and the possible type locality for **Muscina japonica**, which require further verification.  \n\nIn summary, Germany is a central hub for the type localities and distributions of diverse fly species, including members of the genera *Phaonia*, *Pegomya*, *Lucilia*, *Helina*, *Lispe*, *Coenosia*, *Paraprosalpia*, *Parasarcophaga*, *Pegohylemyia*, *Hylemya*, *Hydrophoria*, *Thricops*, *Polietes*, and *Calliphora*. Its contributions to the taxonomy of these species are well-documented, though some records remain speculative or require additional confirmation. The inclusion of both native and foreign distributions reflects Germany’s ecological diversity and its role as a reference point for European and global fly species. (Word count: 250)\",34\n1942,POLIETES LARDARIA,\"\n\n**Polietes lardaria** is a species of fly within the genus *Polietes*, which belongs to the family Syrphidae (hoverflies). Originally described as *Musca lardaria* by the Danish entomologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1781, the species was later reclassified into the genus *Polietes*. The type locality for this species is Germany, as established in its original description. However, subsequent taxonomic work has revealed additional regional records and synonyms. In 1965, a study by Fan identified a synonym for *Polietes lardaria*, *Polietes (Pseudomorellia) omeishanensis*, suggesting possible regional variations or historical misclassifications.  \n\nThe species is distributed across multiple geographic regions. It is native to China, specifically documented in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. Beyond China, *Polietes lardaria* is also found in Mongolia, Japan, the former USSR, and parts of Europe. This wide distribution indicates its adaptability to diverse temperate and boreal climates. The inclusion of European populations aligns with the original type locality in Germany, while the records in Asia highlight its presence in both eastern and western regions of the continent.  \n\nTaxonomically, *Polietes lardaria* has undergone revisions. The initial placement in *Musca* by Fabricius reflects an older classification system, as modern phylogenetic studies have reorganized hoverflies into more accurate genera. The synonym *Polietes (Pseudomorellia) omeishanensis* further underscores the complexity of its taxonomic history, potentially representing a subspecies or a regional variant. Despite these historical shifts, the species is now consistently recognized under the genus *Polietes*.  \n\nEcologically, *Polietes lardaria* is likely to share traits with other hoverflies, such as mimicking bees or wasps for predator avoidance and feeding on nectar or pollen as adults. Its larvae may exhibit predatory or saprophagous behaviors, though specific details about its life cycle or ecological role are not provided in the descriptions. The species’ presence in both Europe and Asia suggests it may play a role in pollination or pest control in these regions.  \n\nThe discrepancy between the original 1781 description by Fabricius and the 1965 synonym by Fan highlights the evolving nature of taxonomic classifications. While the type locality remains Germany, the species’ broader distribution in Asia and Europe indicates it is not restricted to its original geographic context. Researchers should consider both historical and modern references to fully understand its taxonomy and biogeography.  \n\nIn summary, *Polietes lardaria* is a hoverfly species with a long taxonomic history, first described in 1781 and later synonymized in 1965. It inhabits temperate and boreal regions across Europe, Asia, and parts of the former USSR, with documented populations in Germany, China (Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang), Mongolia, Japan, and other areas. Its classification under *Polietes* reflects updated phylogenetic understanding, while the synonym *Pseudomorellia omeishanensis* points to regional taxonomic nuances. The species’ ecological significance and adaptability to varied climates remain areas for further study.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",13\n3672,LUCILIA (PHAEINICIA) CUPRINA CUPRINA,\"A subspecies of *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina* described by Wiedemann in 1830.
