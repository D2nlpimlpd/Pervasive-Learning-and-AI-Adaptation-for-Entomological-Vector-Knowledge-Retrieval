The provided data contains conflicting references to its provincial location, with some descriptions erroneously citing Jilin Province. However, the majority of the information aligns with Fushun being situated in Liaoning, a province in northeastern China known for its ecological and geographical significance. As a location in Liaoning, Fushun is explicitly mentioned in species records, underscoring its role in biodiversity documentation. The discrepancy regarding Jilin likely stems from inaccuracies in the source data, as Fushun is historically and administratively part of Liaoning. The city is linked to *Phaonia fuscata*, a species of fly, and *Calliphora axata*, a blowfly, both of which are noted to inhabit the region. These associations highlight Fushun’s importance in entomological studies and ecological monitoring. Despite the conflicting provincial references, the consistent identification of Liaoning in three of the four descriptions supports its correct placement. The summary reconciles the contradictions by prioritizing the majority consensus and clarifying the likely errors in the Jilin-based claims.

Additionally, Xian is part of the distribution range of *Calliphora axata*, a blowfly species commonly associated with forensic and ecological research. These two facts underscore Xian’s importance as a hub for the study of dipteran insects, particularly in understanding their habitats and ecological roles. The city’s inclusion in the distribution of *Calliphora axata* suggests it provides suitable environmental conditions for this species, which is often found in temperate and subtropical zones. Meanwhile, the discovery of *Phaonia xianensis* in Xian indicates the city’s potential as a center for identifying and classifying new or regionally significant insect species. Both references align with Xian’s broader context as a historically and culturally rich city in central China, known for its ancient heritage and contributions to various scientific fields. The descriptions provided are consistent, as they both emphasize Xian’s geographical and ecological relevance without conflicting details. In summary, Xian is a key location in Shaanxi Province for entomological research, linked to the discovery of *Phaonia xianensis* and the presence of *Calliphora axata*, reflecting its role in advancing knowledge of insect biodiversity and distribution patterns.\",1\n3746,ANKANG,\"Location in Shaanxi province, China, part of Calliphora axata's distribution\",1\n3747,XU CHENG,\"Location in Shandong province, China, part of Calliphora axata's distribution\",1\n3748,JIYUAN,\"Location in Henan province, China, part of Calliphora axata's distribution\",1\n3749,KAIFENG,\"City in Henan province, China, part of Calliphora axata's distribution\",1\n3750,YANGZHOU,\"Location in Jiangsu province, China, part of Calliphora axata's distribution\",1\n3751,ZHENJIANG,\"\n\nZHENJIANG is a city located in Jiangsu province, China, and serves as a key geographical reference in the distribution of the species *Calliphora axata*.
