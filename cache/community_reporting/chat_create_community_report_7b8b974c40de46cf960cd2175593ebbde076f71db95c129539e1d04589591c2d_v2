It is native to Tibet, with its type locality specifically recorded as Yadong, a region in the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau. The species is distinguished by a combination of morphological traits that define its taxonomic identity. Notably, it exhibits a **narrow, low frons** (the area between the eyes and the base of the antennae), a characteristic that contributes to its unique appearance among related species. Additionally, the fly possesses a **white arista** (a bristle-like structure on the head) with **brown marginal bristles**, which further aids in its identification. \n\nIn terms of coloration and size, **DRYMEIA YADONGENSIS** has **yellow axillary scales**, a feature observed in its wing base region. The body length of this species is approximately **6 mm**, placing it within the typical size range for members of its genus. These physical attributes—narrow frons, white arista with brown bristles, yellow axillary scales, and a 6 mm body—collectively serve as diagnostic markers for the species. \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in their taxonomic details, with no contradictions noted regarding the authors, year of description, or key morphological features. The synthesis of these characteristics offers a clear, unified profile of **DRYMEIA YADONGENSIS**, emphasizing its geographic origin in Yadong, Tibet, and the specific anatomical traits that set it apart from other flies in the genus *Drymeia*.

However, there is a contradiction in the provided data: one description also identifies YADING as the \"\"type locality in Tibet for *Drymeia yadongensis*,\"\" a species of fly first described from the region. This discrepancy arises from the potential confusion between \"\"Yading\"\" in Sichuan and \"\"Yadong\"\" (also spelled \"\"Yadong\"\") in Tibet, as both are distinct locations with similar-sounding names.  \n\nTo resolve this, it is important to clarify that *Sichuan Oestroderma* is explicitly linked to Yading in Sichuan, while *Drymeia yadongensis* is associated with Yadong in Tibet, a different locality. The mention of YADING as the type locality for *Drymeia yadongensis* likely reflects an error in the original description, possibly due to the phonetic similarity between \"\"Yading\"\" and \"\"Yadong.\"\" Despite this, Yading in Sichuan remains a key location for the study of *Sichuan Oestroderma*, underscoring its role in regional entomological research.  \n\nIn summary, YADING is a location in Sichuan Province, China, known for its association with the species *Sichuan Oestroderma*. The conflicting reference to it being the type locality for *Drymeia yadongensis* in Tibet appears to stem from a mix-up with the similarly named Yadong County, which is the correct type locality for *Drymeia yadongensis*.

Additionally, the county is explicitly referenced in the **taxonomic key for Sarcophagini**, a tribe within the family Syrphidae, further emphasizing its importance in the study of hoverflies and related taxa. The repeated association of Yadong with type localities and taxonomic keys highlights its ecological and scientific relevance, particularly in documenting biodiversity in the Tibetan region. All descriptions consistently identify Yadong as a location in Tibet, China, with no contradictions in the data. Its prominence in entomology reflects the area’s unique habitat and the contributions of researchers to understanding the distribution and morphology of these fly species.\",3\n1308,LHASA,\"\n\nLHASA is the capital city of Tibet, China, and a significant geographic reference in entomological taxonomy. Located in the Xizang (Tibet) region, it is explicitly noted as the type locality for several species and subspecies, including the 1353 Lhasa Pierretia Fly, the subspecies *Morellia hortorum tibetana*, and *Calythea xizangensis*. These designations highlight Lhasa’s role as a critical site for the initial discovery and formal description of these organisms. Additionally, Lhasa is referenced in the taxonomic key for *Sarcophagini*, a family of flies, further underscoring its importance in the classification of insect species. The city is also associated with the distribution of *Mesembrina meridiana nudiparafacia*, a subspecies of the *Mesembrina meridiana* fly, indicating its ecological relevance as a habitat for this species. While the descriptions emphasize Lhasa’s entomological significance, they collectively affirm its identity as the administrative and cultural center of Tibet. The repeated mention of \"\"type locality\"\" across multiple species suggests that Lhasa is a well-documented location in scientific literature for biodiversity studies, particularly in the field of dipteran taxonomy. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions align with Lhasa’s status as a capital city and its role in the taxonomic records of these specific species. The summary integrates all entities and details into a cohesive narrative, reflecting both its geographical and scientific importance.\",3\n3992,CUONAN,Type locality in Tibet for Dexopollenia uniseta,1\n3995,DEXOPOLLENIA UNISETA,\"Species of fly described by Fan in 1968, found in Tibet (Cuona)\",4\n4003,PROC.

The species was formally co-described by this group of researchers, as noted in the first description, which clarifies that **Fan** collaborated with **Zhong** and **Wu** in its taxonomic classification. A second description, which states that **Fan** is the sole author of the 1981 description, appears to be an oversimplification or incomplete reference, as the original publication explicitly credits **Fan**, **Zhong**, and **Wu** as joint contributors. This resolution aligns with standard taxonomic practices, where multiple authors are acknowledged when a species is described collaboratively. The name *Drymeia yadongensis* is derived from the genus *Drymeia* and the specific epithet *yadongensis*, likely referencing the geographic location (Yadong) where the species was first identified or collected. While the provided data does not include additional details about the species’ morphology, habitat, or ecological significance, the key point of its 1981 description by **Fan**, **Zhong**, and **Wu** is consistent across the sources. **Fan**’s role as a co-author underscores their contribution to the taxonomic work, though the second description’s assertion of sole authorship is corrected by the inclusion of **Zhong** and **Wu** in the first account. No further contradictions or discrepancies are present in the data, and the summary integrates all provided information into a coherent narrative. The entity **FAN** is specifically highlighted as one of the three researchers responsible for the description, alongside **Zhong** and **Wu**, in the year 1981. This clarification ensures accuracy in attributing the taxonomic work to the correct authors. The species *Drymeia yadongensis* remains a subject of entomological study, though its broader biological context is not detailed in the given descriptions. The summary emphasizes the collaborative nature of the 1981 publication and the role of **Fan** within it, resolving the ambiguity between the two descriptions by prioritizing the more specific information provided in the first. The final account adheres to the third-person perspective and includes all relevant entity names to maintain clarity and context.\",303\n440,CHIROSIA LATICERCA,FAN,Fan described the species Chirosia laticerca in 1985,300\n1421,LEUCOPHORA AURANTIFRONS,FAN,Fan described Leucophora aurantifrons in Insect Research Journal,300\n1435,LEUCOPHORA XIZANGENSIS,FAN,Fan co-described Leucophora xizangensis with Zhong in 1984,300\n1530,瘦喙近脉花蝇,FAN,FAN co-described the species 瘦喙近脉花蝇 with ZHONG in 1980,300\n1334,DELIA TENUIPENSIS,FAN,Fan co-described Delia tenuipensis in 1982,299\n1338,DELIA QUADRILATERALIS,FAN,Fan co-described Delia quadrilateralis in 1982,299\n1254,FAN,DELIA ATRIFRONS,Fan described Delia atrifrons in 1982,298\n4020,YUNNAN,NEOMYIA (ORTHELLIA) YUNNANENSIS,\"The species *Neomyia (Orthellia) yunnanensis* is associated with its type locality in Yunnan (Jianshui)\nThe species is distributed in Yunnan Province, China\",162\n557,TIBET,INSECTA LAPPONICA,Insecta lapponica is distributed in Tibet,142\n9571,戽斗细麻蝇,TIBET,戽斗细麻蝇 is distributed in Tibet,141\n3474,TIBET,MORELLIA HORTORUM TIBETANA FAN,\"Morellia hortorum tibetana is distributed in Tibet, China\",137\n7292,TIBET,POLLINIOPSIS MILINA,The species *Polleniopsis milina* is distributed in Tibet (Milin),137\n7295,TIBET,PARADICHOSIA CR,The species *Paradichosia cr* is distributed in Tibet,137\n890,TIBET,TIBET MILITARY DISTRICT,The Tibet Military District conducted surveys in Tibet,135\n1920,TIBET,CUONA,Cuona is a county in Tibet where Calythea xizangensis is distributed,135\n2224,PEGOMYA DICHAEATOMYIOA,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,Acta Entomologica Sinica published the description of Pegomya dichaetomyiola,69\n9619,ACTA ZOOLOGICA SINICA,1353 LHASA PIERRETIAS,The species was documented in the Acta Zoologica Sinica journal,69\n3479,MORELLIA HORTORUM (FALLEN),ZIMIN,Zimin's 1951 work includes illustrations of Morellia hortorum,27\n7271,ZHONG,POLLENIOPSIS LATA,Zhong is an author of the species Polleniopsis lata,16\n1750,ZHONG,盘叶泉种蝇,ZHONG 是盘叶泉种蝇的共同描述者,15\n933,HYDROPHORIA LONGISSIMA,ZHONG,Zhong co-described the species Hydrophoria longissima,13\n3180,DRYMEIA YADONGENSIS,YADING,\"The species Drymeia yadongensis was first collected in Yading, Tibet\",10\n934,HYDROPHORIA MONTANA,ANDUO,Anduo is a location in Tibet where Hydrophoria montana is distributed,9\n9577,戽斗细麻蝇,宝兴细麻蝇,\"戽斗细麻蝇 is closely related to 宝兴细麻蝇, differing in male genitalia morphology\",8\n443,CHIROSIA LATICERCA,PYCNOGLOSSA,Chirosia laticerca is part of the subgenus Pycnoglossa,6\n1424,LEUCOPHORA AURANTIFRONS,LONGZI COUNTY SAN'ANQULIN,Leucophora aurantifrons is distributed in Longzi County San'anqulin,6\n1438,LEUCOPHORA XIZANGENSIS,LONGZI,Longzi in Tibet is the type locality for Leucophora xizangensis,6\n1439,LEUCOPHORA XIZANGENSIS,ZEDANG,Zedang in Tibet is a distribution location for Leucophora xizangensis,6\n1533,瘦喙近脉花蝇,安多,The species 瘦喙近脉花蝇 is associated with Anduo in Tibet,6\n2206,YADONG,PEGOMYA DICHAEATOMYIOA,Yadong is the type locality for Pegomya dichaetomyiola,6\n3475,LHASA,MORELLIA HORTORUM TIBETANA FAN,Lhasa is the type locality for the subspecies Morellia hortorum tibetana,6\n7501,CUONAN,DEXOPOLLENIA UNISETA,Cuona is the type locality for Dexopollenia uniseta,5\n7506,DEXOPOLLENIA UNISETA,PROC.
