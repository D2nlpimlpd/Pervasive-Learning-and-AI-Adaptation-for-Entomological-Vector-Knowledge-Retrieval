It is distinguished by a combination of morphological traits that aid in its classification and identification. Key characteristics include a **flagellum lacking plumose bristles**, a feature that differentiates it from related genera. Males of the genus are further marked by a **broad frons**, a distinct facial structure. Additionally, Euryomma species exhibit a **bare arista** (a hair-like appendage at the end of the antenna, referred to as *antennal芒* in the original description) and **short genal bristles**, which are sensory hairs on the cheeks. The genus is also notable for its **specific wing venation pattern**, a critical diagnostic feature in dipteran taxonomy. These traits collectively define Euryomma’s unique identity within the Fanniinae subfamily, emphasizing its specialized adaptations and evolutionary distinctiveness. The descriptions provided are consistent, with no contradictions requiring resolution.\",3\n1559,FANNIINA,,6\n1558,PIEZURA,\"\n\n**Piezura** is a genus within the Fanniinae subfamily of flies, first described by the entomologist Rondani in 1866. The genus is characterized by distinct morphological features that aid in its taxonomic identification. Notably, male specimens of *Piezura* exhibit a **narrow frons** (the forehead region of the head), a trait that differentiates them from other genera in the subfamily. Additionally, the **subcostal vein** in the wings of *Piezura* is described as **non-arched**, which contrasts with the arched subcostal vein observed in some related genera. These wing venation patterns are critical for classification within the Fanniinae, as they often serve as key diagnostic markers.  \n\nBeyond wing venation, *Piezura* is further distinguished by its **bristle arrangements**. The specific distribution and morphology of bristles on the body and wings are unique to this genus, contributing to its identification in entomological studies. These bristle patterns, combined with the wing venation traits, provide a comprehensive framework for differentiating *Piezura* from other genera in the subfamily.  \n\nThe Fanniinae subfamily, to which *Piezura* belongs, is part of the family Syrphidae (hoverflies), a group known for their ecological roles as pollinators and their morphological diversity. While the genus is relatively small in species count compared to other Fanniinae genera, its defining characteristics—particularly the narrow male frons and non-arched subcostal vein—have been consistently highlighted in taxonomic literature. These features are not only diagnostic for *Piezura* but also reflect evolutionary adaptations within the subfamily.  \n\nIn summary, *Piezura* is a well-defined genus in the Fanniinae subfamily, characterized by a combination of a narrow male frons, non-arched subcostal wing veins, and distinctive bristle arrangements. These traits, first documented by Rondani in 1866, remain central to its classification and distinguish it from other genera in the group. Its study contributes to understanding the biodiversity and systematics of hoverflies, which are ecologically significant insects.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2482,EURYOMMA,FANNIINA,Euryomma is a genus in the Fanniinae subfamily,9\n2487,FANNIINA,EURYOMMA,Euryomma is a genus within the Fanniinae subfamily,9\n2485,PIEZURA,FANNIINA,Piezura is a genus in the Fanniinae subfamily,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
