In 1901, Kertesz formally described the species *Delia megatricha*, establishing its scientific nomenclature and taxonomic placement. Additionally, Kertesz is credited as the author of two species within the genus *Fucellia*: *Fucellia chinensis* and *Fucellia apicalis*. These descriptions highlight Kertesz’s expertise in entomology or related biological taxonomy, as both *Delia* and *Fucellia* are genera commonly associated with flies (Diptera) or other arthropods.  \n\nThe descriptions provided contain a minor inconsistency in the spelling of *Fucellia chinensis* (referred to as *Fucellia chinnensis* in one instance), which is resolved by standardizing the name to *Fucellia chinensis*, the correct and widely accepted scientific name. This correction ensures clarity and adherence to taxonomic conventions. Kertesz’s work on these species, spanning at least 1901, reflects their role in documenting biodiversity during the early 20th century. While the specific context of their research (e.g., geographic focus, ecological significance of the species) is not detailed in the provided data, the repeated attribution of these species to Kertesz underscores their importance in the field.  \n\nIn summary, **KERTESZ** is a historical taxonomist associated with the formal description of *Delia megatricha* (1901) and the naming of *Fucellia chinensis* and *Fucellia apicalis*. Their work contributes to the scientific understanding of these species, though further details about their broader research or the ecological roles of the species remain unspecified in the given data.
