It is distributed in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Gansu, and western Sichuan, with the UK as its type locality.\",10\n790,HARRIS,\"\n\nHARRIS is a historical figure recognized as an entomologist, taxonomist, and researcher who made significant contributions to the classification of insect species in the late 18th century. He is primarily associated with the description of multiple species, many of which were documented in 1780. Among his notable works, Harris is credited with first describing the species *Polietes domitor* in 1780, a classification that remains foundational in entomological taxonomy. Additionally, he described *Musca audacula* in the same year, which was later linked to the type species of the genus *Paregle*. This connection suggests that Harris’s original work on *Musca audacula* may have been reclassified or realigned with *Paregle* in subsequent taxonomic revisions. He also first described *Paregle audacula* in 1780, indicating his direct involvement in establishing the genus *Paregle* and its associated species.  \n\nHarris’s contributions extend to other insect species, including *Drymeia vicana*, which he described in the publication *Expos. Eng. Ins.* in 1780, and *Helina reversio*, another species he documented in the same year. Furthermore, he is associated with the description of *Pyrellia rapax*, known in Chinese as 粉背碧蝇 (translating to \"\"powdery-backed green fly\"\"), and *喜蜜阳蝇* (a Chinese name for an unspecified species, likely a translation of \"\"honey-loving fly\"\"). These entries highlight his work across diverse insect families and his role in bridging scientific and regional nomenclature.  \n\nHarris is also noted as the author of *Hydrophoria lancifer*, a work that may relate to his broader taxonomic studies or a specific species within the Hydrophoria genus. His role as a taxonomist is further reinforced by his association with this species, which is explicitly tied to his authorship. While the exact nature of *Hydrophoria lancifer* (whether a species or a publication) is not fully clarified in the data, it underscores his engagement with entomological literature.  \n\nThe descriptions provided are largely consistent, though some require contextual resolution. For instance, the mention of *Musca audacula* being \"\"later linked to Paregle’s type species\"\" implies a taxonomic revision where Harris’s original classification was re-evaluated and connected to the *Paregle* genus. Similarly, the Chinese names for species like *喜蜜阳蝇* and 粉背碧蝇 (Pyrellia rapax) suggest his work was referenced or translated in non-English scientific contexts, reflecting the international reach of his research.  \n\nIn summary, HARRIS is a key 18th-century entomologist and taxonomist who described several insect species, including *Polietes domitor*, *Musca audacula* (linked to *Paregle*), *Paregle audacula*, *Drymeia vicana*, *Helina reversio*, and *Pyrellia rapax*, with many of these documented in 1780. His authorship of *Hydrophoria lancifer* and his role in connecting regional and scientific nomenclature further cement his legacy in entomology. The data collectively portray Harris as a meticulous scientist whose work laid groundwork for later taxonomic classifications and cross-cultural scientific communication.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",7\n1952,POLIETES DOMITOR,\"A species of fly described by Harris in 1780, with synonyms like Musca albolineata.
