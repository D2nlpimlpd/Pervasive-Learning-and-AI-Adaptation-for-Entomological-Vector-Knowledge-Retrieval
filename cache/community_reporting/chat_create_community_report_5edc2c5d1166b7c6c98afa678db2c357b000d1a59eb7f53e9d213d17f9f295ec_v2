Entities in this community include various genera and species such as *Carceilia*, *Hydrotaea*, *Phaonia*, and *Pegomya*, as well as specific locations like Zeku Maixiu Mountain and Chaidamu. These entities are interconnected through their ecological presence in Qinghai and their taxonomic descriptions by researchers like Stein. The province is also linked to publications and studies, such as *Annu.Mus.zool.Aca.Sci.St.-Petersb.*, which document the biodiversity and type localities of these species.

These species are often described as being found in Qinghai, and the province is noted as a type locality for many of them, indicating its importance in entomological research. The relationships between Qinghai and these species are well-documented, with multiple records showing their presence and taxonomic origins in the region.

These include Zeku Maixiu Mountain, where *Pegomya aurivillosa* and *Hypoderma qinghaiense* were first identified, and Chaidamu, the type locality for *Coenosia dilatitarsis*. Other notable type localities in Qinghai are Menyuan for *Hydrotaea spinosa* and *Hydrotaea nudispinosa*, and Yushu for *Helina truncata*. The presence of these type localities underscores Qinghai’s role in the formal classification and scientific understanding of fly species.

The province is home to a diverse array of taxa, including the genus *Mesembrina* (e.g., *Mesembrina montana*), *Xestomyia hirtifemur*, *Drymeia brumalis*, *Drymeia plumisaeta*, *Drymeia aculeata*, and *Drymeia pectinitibia*. It also hosts *Eutrichota* species, *Lydella grisescens*, *Oestroderma qinghaiense*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Tachina nupta*, and *Peteina hyperdiscalis*. Multiple *Nupedia* species, such as *Nupedia fulva*, *Nupedia patellans*, *Nupedia linotaenia*, and *Nupedia aestiva*, are documented in Qinghai, alongside *Adia danieli* and the genus *Adia*.  \n\nThe province is notable for its role as a type locality for several species, including *Hydrotaea spinosa* and *Hydrotaea nudispinosa* (both in Menyuan), *Scathophaga amplipennis* (type locality), and *Sinochirosia variegata* (type locality in Qinghai). *Phaonia* species such as *Phaonia incana*, *Phaonia hamiloba*, *Phaonia tenuirostris*, *Phaonia rufitarsis*, and *Phaonia decussata* are prevalent, with *Phaonia errans* specifically noted in the Chaidamu region. *Hydrophoria malaenia* and other *Hydrophoria* species, as well as *Hydrotaea palaestrica* (in Yushu), are also found here.  \n\nQinghai supports multiple *Delia* species, including *Delia canalis*, *Delia felsicanalis*, *Delia angustissima*, *Delia brassicaeformis*, *Delia subnigribasis*, *Delia nigribasis*, and *Delia coarctata* (in Huangyuan, Qilian, and Zhumu), with Qilian NiuXinshan serving as the type locality for *Delia sphaerobasis*. *Pegomya* species like *Pegomya flavoscutellata*, *Pegomya aurivillosa*, *Pegomya esuriens*, *Pegomya betae*, *Pegomya aniseta*, *Pegomya melatrochanter*, *Pegomya dentella*, and *Pegomya rarifemoriseta* are distributed across the province, with Chaidamu identified as the type locality for *Coenosia dilatitarsis*.  \n\nAdditional genera and species documented in Qinghai include *Calliphora* (e.g., *Calliphora rohdendorfi*, *Calliphora chinghaiensis* in Yushu, Zeku), *Calythea xizangensis* in Nangqian, *Chaetogena gynacphorae*, *Helina truncata* (type locality in Yushu), *Linnaemya* species, *Polietes nigrolimbata*, *I. tripartita*, *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Pegohylemyia* (e.g., *Pegohylemyia Pulvineta*, *Pegohylemyia latirufifrons*, *Pegohylemyia depressa* as type locality), *Paraprosalpia* (e.g., *Paraprosalpia magnilamella*, *Paraprosalpia pilitarsis*, *Paraprosalpia dasyops* in Nangqian), and *Hylemya* (e.g., *Hylemya bruneipalpis*, *Hylemya nigrimana*, *Hylemya partita*).  \n\nThe province is also associated with *Blondelia nigripes*, *Onesiomima pamirica*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, *Morellia hortorum tibetana*, *Musca domestica*, and the Chinese-specific *Qinghai Bellardia*. Notably, *731 BINGLU FLY* and *细柄折蜂麻蝇* are reported in Qinghai, as are *Monochrotogaster atricornis* and *rufifrons*, *Paregle aterrima* and *Paregle densibarbata*, and *SPALLANZANIA GENUS* and *CARCEILIA GENUS*. Specific locations within Qinghai, such as Xining, Qilian, Golog Prefecture, Menyuan, Yushu, Zeku, Dulan, and the East Qilian Mountains, are highlighted as key habitats for these species.  \n\nQinghai’s ecological significance is further underscored by its inclusion in studies related to the Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing, emphasizing its role in entomological research. The province’s diverse environments support a wide range of insect life, making it a critical area for understanding fly and insect biodiversity in China. This summary consolidates all reported species and locations, resolving minor redundancies while maintaining the full scope of Qinghai’s entomological importance.

It serves as the type locality for *Pegomya aurivillosa*, a species within the genus *Pegomya*, and also for *Hypoderma qinghaiense*, a member of the genus *Hypoderma*. As a type locality, Zeku Maixiu Mountain is the specific site where these species were first identified, collected, and formally described in scientific literature. The mountain’s role in entomology highlights its ecological significance as a habitat for these organisms, contributing to the understanding of biodiversity in the Qinghai region. Both species are associated with the area, though they belong to different taxonomic groups: *Pegomya aurivillosa* is a fly species in the family Anthomyiidae, while *Hypoderma qinghaiense* is a botfly in the family Oestridae. The descriptions provided do not conflict but instead emphasize the mountain’s dual importance in the taxonomic history of these two species. No contradictory information is present, and the summary integrates all details into a cohesive account of Zeku Maixiu Mountain’s role as a type locality.
