These activities include a specific study focused on **Hydrophoria melaena**, a species of water strider (a type of aquatic insect), as part of broader efforts to assess biodiversity and environmental conditions in the region. The military district’s work aligns with its dual responsibilities of maintaining national security and supporting local ecological monitoring initiatives, which may be tied to military infrastructure planning, resource management, or compliance with national conservation policies. While the first description highlights a targeted investigation into Hydrophoria melaena, the second underscores a wider survey of species in Xinjiang, suggesting a comprehensive approach to understanding the area’s ecological landscape. These surveys likely contribute to data collection for scientific research, habitat preservation, or military-environmental coordination in the region. The Xinjiang Military District’s role in such studies reflects the PLA’s increasing emphasis on integrating environmental stewardship with operational duties, particularly in ecologically sensitive or strategically significant areas like Xinjiang. No direct contradictions exist between the descriptions, as the specific focus on Hydrophoria melaena can be interpreted as a component of the broader species survey.
