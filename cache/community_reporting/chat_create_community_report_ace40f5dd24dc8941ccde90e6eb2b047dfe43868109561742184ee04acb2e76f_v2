It has features like at least a yellow tibial band on the front tibia and no tubercle on the mid-tibia. It is found in Heilongjiang (Huma), Inner Mongolia (Jiagedaqi), Shanxi (Ying County), and Tibet (Nagqu, Lhasa, Shigatse) in China, as well as Europe (Germany), Egypt, and North America.>\",5\n1574,胸刺厕蝇,\"胸刺厕蝇 (Fannia fuscula Fallen, 1825) is a species of fly described by Fallen in 1825. It has a strong spine on the abdominal side between the front and mid-tibia and black mid and hind femurs. It is found in Liaoning (Jianchang Dahuishan) and China's northern regions.>\",3\n1587,ANIMAL CLASSIFICATION JOURNAL,\"\n\nThe **ANIMAL CLASSIFICATION JOURNAL** (Chinese: *动物分类学报*, English: *Acta Zoologica Sinica*) is a Chinese academic publication focused on zoological taxonomy and systematics. It has served as a platform for research on animal classification, including the description and analysis of new or understudied species. A notable example is its role in a 1965 study cited in the text, which likely contributed to advancements in taxonomic methodologies or the documentation of specific animal groups. Additionally, the journal has been used to publish descriptions of species such as *Xiao Tumijing Ce Fly* (肖瘤胫厕蝇) and *Mao Ankai Ce Fly* (毛踝厕蝇), highlighting its importance in entomological research and the formal naming of insect taxa. These contributions underscore the journal’s dual function in both foundational taxonomic work and the dissemination of specialized findings in zoology. The journal’s bilingual identity—*动物分类学报* in Chinese and *Acta Zoologica Sinica* in English—reflects its role in bridging international and domestic scientific communities, particularly in the field of animal classification. While the 1965 study and species publications are distinct entries in its history, they collectively illustrate the journal’s long-standing commitment to advancing taxonomic science through diverse research outputs. Its scope appears to encompass both broad taxonomic studies and detailed species-level investigations, making it a key resource for researchers in zoology and related disciplines. The journal’s continued relevance is evident in its documentation of new species, such as the two flies mentioned, which adds to the global understanding of biodiversity and ecological systems. By maintaining a focus on rigorous classification practices, *Acta Zoologica Sinica*/*动物分类学报* supports the systematic organization of animal life, facilitating comparative studies and conservation efforts. The combination of historical citations and modern species descriptions positions the journal as a vital archive for taxonomic research in China and beyond.
