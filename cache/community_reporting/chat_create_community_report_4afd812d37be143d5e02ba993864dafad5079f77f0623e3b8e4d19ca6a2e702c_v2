It is associated with hosts like Acronycta aceris L. and Lymantria dispar L. in literature, and Calpe capucina in Beijing.>\",10\n2161,MUSCA VENTROSA,\"A species of fly described by Wiedemann in 1830, commonly found in China and other Asian regions, feeding on animal and human feces\",6\n2165,福建,\"\n\nFujian is a province located in southeastern China, known for its diverse ecosystems and as a significant domestic distribution area for various species of flies and parasitic insects. The region is home to multiple species within the families Calliphoridae (blowflies) and Tachinidae (tachinid flies), including *Lucilia hainanensis*, *Musca chui*, and *Musca vitripennis*. Additionally, Fujian hosts the *Isomyia* genus, with documented distributions of *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Isomyia oestracea*, and *Isomyia furcicula*. The province is also a key habitat for the *Harpagophalla kempi* species, which has been recorded in cities such as Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Zhangpu, and Xiamen. Notably, three specific parasitic fly species—1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇 (*Chrysomya* sp.), 1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇, and 1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇—are documented as domestic to Fujian, though their exact scientific classifications may require further verification. \n\nFujian’s biodiversity extends to other fly species, including 松毛虫缅麻蝇 (a parasitic fly associated with pine caterpillars) and 环斑孟蝇 (*Musca* sp.), both of which are part of the province’s ecological inventory. The 疏斑纹蝇 (*Musca* sp.) is also noted as a species distributed in Fujian, contributing to the region’s entomological richness. While some descriptions mention Nanjing as a location within Fujian, this is geographically inaccurate, as Nanjing is the capital of Jiangsu Province. The correct cities associated with Fujian in the data are Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Zhangpu, and Xiamen, which serve as focal points for the presence of these species. \n\nIn summary, Fujian functions as a critical ecological zone in China for the distribution of numerous fly and parasitic insect species. Its role as a habitat for both common and specialized species, such as those in the *Isomyia* and *Musca* genera, underscores its importance in regional biodiversity. The province’s specific locations, including Fuzhou and Xiamen, are highlighted for their association with certain species, while the inclusion of catalog numbers (e.g., 1461, 1463, 1464) for gray-faced and Sumatran narrow-cheeked tachinid flies indicates systematic documentation of these insects. Despite minor inconsistencies in the data (e.g., the incorrect reference to Nanjing), Fujian’s status as a hub for these species remains well-supported by the provided descriptions.\",11\n2166,广东,\"\n\nGuangdong is a province in China where multiple species of flies and insects have been documented. It is part of the distribution range for *Dichaetomyia bibax*, a species associated with the Chinese name 松毛虫缅麻蝇 (pine caterpillar fly), and *Helina lateralis*. The province also hosts populations of *Musca chui* and *Musca vitripennis*, both of which are reported to occur domestically within its borders. Specific regions in Guangdong, such as Lian County, Zhanjiang, and Chao’an, are linked to these species, indicating localized biodiversity. Additionally, Guangdong is home to three species of narrow-faced tachinid flies: 1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇 (*Chrysomya* sp. 1461), 1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇 (*Chrysomya* sp. 1463), and 1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇 (*Chrysomya* sp. 1464), which are cataloged under numerical identifiers. These species, along with others, contribute to the province’s ecological significance as a habitat for diverse fly populations. The descriptions collectively highlight Guangdong’s role in supporting both native and potentially invasive insect species, with reports spanning general provincial presence to specific county-level records. No contradictions exist among the provided data, as all references consistently associate Guangdong with the listed species and locations. The province’s inclusion in these records underscores its importance in entomological studies and regional biodiversity monitoring. (Word count: 150)\",11\n2167,海南,\"\n\nHainan is a province located in southern China, renowned for its ecological diversity and as a key distribution area for several insect species. The province hosts a range of species, including *Lucilia hainanensis*, a fly species named after the region, and *Harpagophalla kempi*, which is specifically documented in areas such as Nada, Baisha, Wuzhishan (Shuimanyang), and Wanning (Xinglong). Additionally, *Musca chui* is found in Hainan, further underscoring its role as a habitat for unique and regionally significant insects.  \n\nIn terms of Chinese-named species, Hainan is a domestic location for the 1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇 (1461 Gray Powdered Narrow-cheeked Tachinid Fly), a species identified by its catalog number and local nomenclature. The province also serves as a distribution area for 侧线孟蝇 (Lateral Line Meng Fly) and 疏斑纹蝇 (Sparse-spotted Patterned Fly), both of which are part of its broader entomological biodiversity. These species, along with others, are associated with Hainan’s varied ecosystems, which include tropical forests, coastal regions, and mountainous terrain.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Hainan’s importance as a geographical hub for both scientifically classified and locally named insect species. While some entries reference specific sub-regions within the province (e.g., Wuzhishan and Xinglong), others highlight its general role as a distribution site. There are no direct contradictions in the data, as all descriptions align with Hainan’s status as a province in China supporting these species. The integration of scientific and Chinese terminology reflects the region’s dual recognition in global and local taxonomic contexts.  \n\nIn summary, Hainan is a southern Chinese province with a notable presence of diverse insect species, including *Lucilia hainanensis*, *Harpagophalla kempi*, *Musca chui*, 1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇, 侧线孟蝇, and 疏斑纹蝇. Its ecological significance is further reinforced by the specific habitats within the province, such as Nada, Baisha, Wuzhishan (Shuimanyang), and Wanning (Xinglong), where some of these species are recorded.
