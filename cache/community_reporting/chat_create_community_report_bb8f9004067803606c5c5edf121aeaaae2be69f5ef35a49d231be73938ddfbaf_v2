Historical records indicate that in 1964, the station conducted a specific investigation into fly larvae, likely as part of efforts to address vector-borne diseases or sanitation-related public health concerns during that period. This activity aligns with its broader mandate of conducting health surveys and research to support disease prevention and control measures.  \n\nIn addition to its 1964 work, the station has been involved in surveys across Jinzhou and the surrounding **Western Liaoning** region. These surveys likely encompass a range of public health issues, such as tracking infectious diseases, assessing environmental health risks, or evaluating community health conditions. The inclusion of Western Liaoning in its operational scope suggests the station plays a regional role in health surveillance, extending beyond Jinzhou to address public health challenges in neighboring areas.  \n\nThe combination of these activities—specific investigations like the 1964 fly larvae study and broader regional surveys—demonstrates the station’s commitment to both targeted and comprehensive public health initiatives. Its work in Jinzhou and Western Liaoning underscores its importance in local and regional epidemic prevention, contributing to the understanding and management of health threats in the area. While the 1964 investigation highlights a historical focus on entomological or environmental health research, the ongoing surveys imply a sustained effort to monitor and respond to evolving public health needs.  \n\nBy integrating specialized studies with wide-ranging data collection, the **JINZHOU HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION** serves as a critical entity in safeguarding public health, ensuring timely interventions, and supporting policy decisions to mitigate disease outbreaks and improve community well-being in its jurisdiction.\",4\n6149,1964 SURVEY IN WESTERN LIAONING,Survey conducted in Western Liaoning by the Jinzhou Health and Epidemic Prevention Station,2\n6150,1980 SURVEY IN WESTERN LIAONING,Survey conducted in Western Liaoning by the Jinzhou Health and Epidemic Prevention Station,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11899,JINZHOU HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,1964 SURVEY IN JINZHOU,The station conducted the 1964 survey in Jinzhou,9\n11900,JINZHOU HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,1964 SURVEY IN WESTERN LIAONING,The station conducted the 1964 survey in Western Liaoning,6\n11901,JINZHOU HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,1980 SURVEY IN WESTERN LIAONING,The station conducted the 1980 survey in Western Liaoning,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
