He is credited with describing numerous species, including *Mesembrina mystacea*, *Calliphora vomitoria* (commonly known as the Regurgitating Calliphora), *Stomoxys calcitrans*, *Haematobia irritans*, *Oestrus ovis*, *Hypoderma bovis*, *Oedemagena tarandi* (now *O. tarandi*), *Exorista larvarum*, *Tachina grossa*, *Hydrotaea meteorica*, *Delia radicum*, and *Fannia canicularis*. Linnaeus also established the *Musca* genus in 1758, designating *Musca pluvialis* (now *Fannia canicularis*) and *Musca caesar* (later renamed *Musca carnaria*, though the species *Sarcophaga carnaria* is not the original Linnaean one) as type species. Additionally, he described *Scathophaga stercoraria* and *Scathophaga scybalaria*, as well as *Musca domestica* (the common housefly). His work on domestic animal larvae in the USSR is highlighted, referencing species like *Hypoderma bovis* and *Oedemagena tarandi*. While some descriptions note his role in naming *叉叶绿蝇* (a species now classified under a different genus), the majority emphasize his 1758 publications as pivotal in formalizing taxonomic systems. Linnaeus’s legacy includes the binomial nomenclature framework, which remains central to modern taxonomy. The contradictions in the data—such as the distinction between *Musca carnaria* and *Sarcophaga carnaria*—are resolved by clarifying that Linnaeus originally described *Musca carnaria* in 1758, but the species *Sarcophaga carnaria* was later reclassified, retaining his nomenclature in some contexts. His 1758 works, including *Systema Naturae*, solidified his reputation as a key figure in entomology and zoology.\",31\n6027,OESTRUS OVIS,,2\n1624,FAUNA SUEC,Journal where Fannia canicularis was described,1\n1818,SYST.
