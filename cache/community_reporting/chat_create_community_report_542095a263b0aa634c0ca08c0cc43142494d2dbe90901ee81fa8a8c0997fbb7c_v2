The city’s association with these species highlights its ecological relevance in entomological studies. *Parasarcophaga aegyptica*, a parasitoid fly, is documented to inhabit areas within Lanzhou, contributing to local biodiversity and potentially playing a role in pest control or ecosystem dynamics. Similarly, *Lasiomma curtigena*, a species of cicada, is also reported to be distributed in the city, indicating the presence of suitable habitats for its life cycle, such as forests or shrublands. The repeated mention of Lanzhou’s connection to these species across the descriptions underscores its status as a key location for their study and conservation.
