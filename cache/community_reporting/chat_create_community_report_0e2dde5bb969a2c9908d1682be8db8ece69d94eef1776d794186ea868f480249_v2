He first described the genus *Oestromyia* in 1860 and *Heteronychia* in 1863, the latter as a co-author. In 1858, Brauer described two species, *Rhinoestrus purpureus* and *Crivellia silenus*, the latter of which is referenced in publications about domestic animal larvae in the USSR. \n\nThroughout the 1880s and 1890s, Brauer collaborated with other scientists to co-describe several genera. In 1889, he co-described *Discochaeta*, *Dexodes machairopsis*, *Pseudogonia*, and *Lophyromyia clausa*. He also co-established the genus *Wohlfahrtia* in the same year. In 1891, Brauer described *Strobiloestrus* and *Xylotachina*, while also co-describing *Pseudoperichaeta* and *Xylotachina* (the latter with another collaborator). In 1893, he co-described the genus *Eutachina* with Bergenstamm, *Synthesiomyia*, and *Cryptolucilia* (again with Bergenstamm). Additionally, he is credited with describing the genus *Perichaeta* in 1893, as noted in a Chinese-language source. \n\nBrauer’s work extended to other genera, including *Metoposisyrops* in 1916, which he co-described. He also described *Gasterophilus inermis*, a species associated with the Ewenki Banner, though the exact nature of this connection remains unspecified. His taxonomic efforts spanned a wide range of flies, particularly within the Tachinidae family, and his descriptions were foundational for later studies in entomology. \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in identifying Brauer as a key figure in the field, with no direct contradictions in the data. All entries align with his role as a taxonomist and highlight his collaborations, particularly with Bergenstamm and others, as well as his independent work. The summary integrates all listed genera and species, noting their years of description and co-authors where applicable, to present a cohesive overview of Brauer’s scientific legacy. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",16\n5753,XYLOTACHINA,\"\n\n**Xylotachina** is a genus of tachinid flies (family Tachinidae) first described by German entomologists **Brauer and Bergenstamm** in 1891. The genus is distinguished by a combination of morphological traits, including specific wing venation patterns and bristle arrangements. Notably, Xylotachina species exhibit **two frontal bristles** on the head, a feature critical for taxonomic identification within the group. Additionally, a defining characteristic is the presence of a **row of black bristles behind the postocular bristles on the occiput**, which further aids in differentiating this genus from related taxa. The tibiae of these flies are also marked by **spines**, contributing to their unique physical profile. Wing vein patterns, a key diagnostic feature in tachinid flies, are particularly notable in Xylotachina, though specific details of these patterns are not elaborated in the provided descriptions. The genus is part of the broader Tachinidae family, known for its parasitoid lifestyle, though the ecological habits of Xylotachina are not explicitly detailed here. All three descriptions concur on the taxonomic authority (Brauer and Bergenstamm) and the year of description (1891), while emphasizing distinct morphological markers such as bristle configurations and tibial spines. No contradictions exist in the core taxonomic or physical attributes, allowing for a unified summary. The entity name \"\"Xylotachina\"\" is consistently used across the descriptions, with no conflicting synonyms or alternative classifications mentioned. This genus remains a subject of entomological study due to its specialized traits and placement within the Tachinidae family.
