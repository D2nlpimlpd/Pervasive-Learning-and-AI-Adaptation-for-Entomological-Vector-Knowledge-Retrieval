It serves as a habitat for various genera and species, including *Mesembrina resplendens*, *Mesembrina mystacea*, and *Parasarcophaga* species such as *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*, *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata*, and *Parasarcophaga albiceps*. The province is also home to *Musca* species like *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca convexifrons* (found in Jintang, Ya’an, and Mianyang), *Musca larvipara*, *Musca crassirostris*, and *Musca domestica*. Notable localities within Sichuan include Emei Mountain, a type locality for *Myospila fuscicoxa*, *Helina dibrachiata*, and *Hydrophoria megaloba*; Ya’an, where *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, *THICK RING BLACK FLY*, and *1431家蚕追寄蝇* are recorded; and Kangding, associated with the *Kangding Variant Beauty Fly* (*Paradichosia kangdingensis*) and *Mydaea setifemur kongdinga*. \n\nSichuan hosts multiple *Phaonia* species, including *Phaonia bruneaurea*, *Phaonia mimoincana*, *Phaonia chuanierrans* (specific to Erlang Mountain), and others like *Phaonia hebeta*, *Phaonia lamellata*, and *Phaonia subvivida*. The province is also a key area for *Drymeia* species such as *Drymeia cinerascens*, *Drymeia brevifacies*, and *Drymeia grapsopoda*. Additional genera and species documented in Sichuan include *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia pollenia*, *Metopia auripulvera*, *Metopia suifenhoensis*, *Calliphora axata* (Chongqing), *Calliphora chinghaiensis* (Batang), *Helina rastrella*, *Helina longiquadrata*, and *Helina punctifemoralis*. \n\nThe region supports *Paradichosia* species like *Paradichosia chuanbeiensis* and *Paradichosia parnarae*, as well as *Xenotachina chongqingensis*, *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, and *Bessa* species. Sichuan is further associated with *1393义乌亚麻蝇*, *1397卡西亚麻蝇*, *翼阳细麻蝇*, *戛斗细麻蝇*, and *蓝黑栉寄蝇* (*Pales pavida*). The province’s biodiversity includes *Onesia* species (*sinensis*, *hongyuanensis*, *jiuzhaigouensis*, *chuanxiensis*, *gangziensis*, *wolongensis*), *Lydella* species (*Mydaea tinctoscutaris*, *Mydaea gracilior*), and *Pegohylemyia* species such as *Pegohylemyia fugax* and *Pegohylemyia sichuanensis*. \n\nSichuan’s ecological significance is underscored by its role as a domestic distribution site for *Heteronychia macromembrana*, *Calythea nigricans*, *Goniopora picea*, and *Vibrissina Rondani*. It is also linked to the host species *粘虫* (a type of caterpillar) and the Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing. The province’s cities and natural features, such as Wolong, Gangzi, and Erlang Mountain, are highlighted in species records, including *Servillia planiforceps*, *Servillia ardens*, and *Tachina nupta*. \n\nWith over 50 distinct species and genera documented, Sichuan’s insect fauna reflects its varied landscapes, from mountainous regions like Emei Mountain and Litang Kangka to plains and valleys. The province’s role as a hub for entomological research is evident through its inclusion in studies by institutions like the Chengdu Military Region and its status as a type locality for several species. This summary consolidates Sichuan’s extensive and diverse fly species distribution, emphasizing its ecological and scientific importance in China.\",185\n2222,伪毛颧家蝇,,2\n1879,HENGDUAN MOUNTAINS,\"\n\nThe Hengduan Mountains are a prominent mountain range located in southwestern China, spanning the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet, as well as parts of Qinghai and Gansu. This region is characterized by its rugged topography, high biodiversity, and ecological significance, serving as a critical area for scientific research. The Hengduan Mountains are particularly notable for their role in entomological studies, as highlighted in two key references. First, they are referenced in the study of *Drymeia* species, a genus of flies within the family Muscidae, which underscores the area’s importance as a habitat for diverse insect populations. Second, the Hengduan Mountains are associated with the publication *Insects of the Hengduan Mountains*, a work that likely documents the region’s rich insect fauna and contributes to broader understanding of its ecosystems. These studies emphasize the Hengduan Mountains as a hotspot for biodiversity, where unique environmental conditions support specialized species and provide opportunities for taxonomic and ecological research. The mountain range’s geographical complexity, including steep gradients and varied microclimates, further enhances its value as a natural laboratory for investigating evolutionary processes and species adaptation. Collectively, the descriptions position the Hengduan Mountains as a vital region in China for both geographical and biological sciences, particularly in the context of insect diversity and conservation.\",2\n1706,CHONGQING JINYUN SHAN,\"Chongqing Jinyun Mountain in Sichuan, a distribution site for Xenotachina chongqingensis\",1\n1707,CHONGQING NASHAN,\"Chongqing Nanshan in Sichuan, a distribution site for Xenotachina chongqingensis\",1\n2090,JINTANG,\"\n\nJINTANG is a county-level administrative division located in Sichuan Province, China. While one description refers to it as a \"\"city,\"\" this likely reflects a common but imprecise usage of the term in Chinese administrative terminology, where \"\"city\"\" can sometimes encompass both urban and county-level jurisdictions. Officially, Jintang is classified as a county, which is a sub-provincial administrative unit within the province. It is situated in the eastern part of Sichuan, contributing to the region's diverse geographical and cultural landscape.  \n\nThe county is notable for its mention in the taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, a family of flies (Sarcophagidae) in the order Diptera. This reference suggests that Jintang may serve as a type locality or a significant location for the study, classification, or observation of certain Sarcophagini species. Such taxonomic associations often highlight areas with unique ecological conditions or biodiversity, which could be relevant to entomological research in the region. However, the specific scientific context or species linked to Jintang in this key is not detailed in the provided descriptions.  \n\nSichuan Province, where Jintang is located, is known for its mountainous terrain, including parts of the Sichuan Basin and the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The province is also culturally and historically rich, with a history of significant contributions to Chinese civilization. As a county, Jintang would fall under the jurisdiction of a prefecture-level city, though the exact parent city is not specified in the data.  \n\nIn summary, JINTANG is a county in Sichuan Province, China, recognized both as an administrative unit and as a geographical reference in entomological taxonomy. Its dual designation as a \"\"city\"\" and \"\"county\"\" underscores the nuances of Chinese administrative terminology, where lower-level divisions may be colloquially referred to as cities. The mention in the Sarcophagini taxonomic key indicates its relevance to scientific studies, though further details on this connection remain unexplored in the given data. The entity’s role within Sichuan’s administrative framework and its ecological significance, if any, warrant additional context for a more complete understanding.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",1\n2091,FENGJIE,\"Fengjie is a city in Sichuan province, China\",1\n2092,ZHAOJUE,\"\n\nZhaojue is a county-level city located in Sichuan Province, China. It is often described as a city within the province, but its administrative classification as a county-level city clarifies that it functions as a sub-prefectural division, subordinate to a prefecture-level city (though the specific prefecture is not mentioned in the provided data). This dual reference to \"\"city\"\" and \"\"county\"\" reflects the nuanced structure of Chinese administrative divisions, where county-level cities are considered part of the county tier but operate with municipal governance. Zhaojue is also explicitly noted as a county in Sichuan Province, aligning with its role in local governance and regional identity.  \n\nBeyond its administrative context, Zhaojue holds significance in scientific literature, particularly in the taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, a family of flies (Diptera: Sarcophagidae). This reference suggests that the location may be associated with entomological studies, biodiversity documentation, or ecological research related to these insects. The inclusion of Zhaojue in such a key highlights its relevance as a geographical identifier for classifying or studying Sarcophagini species, potentially due to its unique environmental conditions or documented presence of specific taxa.  \n\nThe entity \"\"Zhaojue\"\" thus represents both a political-administrative unit in Sichuan and a geographical marker in specialized scientific contexts. While the descriptions initially appear contradictory by labeling it as both a city and a county, this is resolved by understanding China’s administrative hierarchy, where county-level cities are a recognized category. Its mention in the Sarcophagini taxonomic key underscores its utility in academic and biological frameworks, adding a layer of scientific importance to its regional profile.  \n\nZhaojue’s role as a county-level city implies it serves as a hub for local governance, economic activities, and cultural preservation within Sichuan. The province itself is known for its diverse landscapes, historical heritage, and ecological significance, which may contribute to Zhaojue’s relevance in both administrative and scientific domains. However, the provided data does not elaborate on its population, history, or other socio-economic details, focusing instead on its dual classification and entomological association.  \n\nIn summary, Zhaojue is a county-level city in Sichuan Province, China, recognized in both administrative and scientific contexts. Its inclusion in the Sarcophagini taxonomic key emphasizes its role in biological classification, while its status as a county-level city reflects its position within China’s administrative structure. The entity’s description reconciles the apparent contradiction by clarifying the terminology used in Chinese governance and highlighting its interdisciplinary relevance.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n559,SICHUAN,INSECTA LAPPONICA,Insecta lapponica is distributed in Sichuan,193\n3722,SICHUAN,伪毛颧家蝇,四川省是伪毛颧家蝇的国内分布区域,187\n7487,SICHUAN,HENGDUAN MOUNTAINS,The Hengduan Mountains are a geographical region within Sichuan,187\n2781,SICHUAN,CHONGQING JINYUN SHAN,Chongqing Jinyun Mountain is located in Sichuan,186\n2782,SICHUAN,CHONGQING NASHAN,Chongqing Nanshan is located in Sichuan,186\n3562,SICHUAN,JINTANG,Jintang is a city located in Sichuan province,186\n3563,SICHUAN,FENGJIE,Fengjie is a city located in Sichuan province,186\n3564,SICHUAN,ZHAOJUE,Zhaojue is a city located in Sichuan province,186\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
