It was established by entomologists Fan and Qian as a *subgenus novus* (new subgenus) to categorize specific species within *Parasarcophaga* that exhibit distinct morphological or genetic characteristics. The subgenus is defined by its inclusion of the type species *Parasarcophaga emdeni*, which serves as the reference point for its classification. *Parasarcophaga emdeni* is a key member of this subgenus, highlighting its role in the broader taxonomic framework of the genus. The creation of **APICAMPLEXA** reflects efforts to refine the systematic organization of fly species, particularly those with ecological or evolutionary significance. Both descriptions provided align in identifying the subgenus as a taxonomic innovation by Fan and Qian, emphasizing its connection to *Parasarcophaga* and the foundational role of *P. emdeni*. No contradictions exist between the sources, as they collectively confirm the subgenus’s establishment, its parent genus, and its type species.

In 1981, Qian and Fan co-established the subgenus *Apicamplexa* and described the species *Pierretia bihami*, *Bellardia sastylata*, and *Sinoprosa aertica*. They also co-authored the genus *HUO HUAYING SHU* in the same year. Additionally, Qian was involved in the description of *Hydrophoria longissima*, *Hydrophoria crassiforceps*, and *Hydrophoria pronata*, though the exact year for the latter two is unspecified. In 1984, Qian independently described the species *Delia sphaerobasis*. By 1988, Qian co-described *Leucophora brevifrons dasyprosterna* and contributed to the ecological habit data of a fly species in Xinjiang, China. Qian and Fan also collaborated on *Drymeia xinjiangensis*, published in *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, and *Eutrichota aertica*. Furthermore, Qian is credited as a co-author for *Pegomya crinilamella* and *E. hamata* and *E. quadrirecta*, the latter two being described alongside Fan. Notably, Qian is one of the scientists who described *Pyrellia habaheensis*, a species of fly associated with the Habahe region. Their work spans multiple genera and subgenera, including *Pierretia*, *Bellardia*, *Drymeia*, *Eutrichota*, *Leucophora*, and *Sinoprosa*, with a focus on entomological research in China. The descriptions often appear in academic journals such as *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, reflecting Qian’s role in advancing the classification of Diptera species. Collaborations with Fan are central to many of these contributions, particularly in the 1980s, while Qian also conducted independent research on species like *Delia sphaerobasis*.
