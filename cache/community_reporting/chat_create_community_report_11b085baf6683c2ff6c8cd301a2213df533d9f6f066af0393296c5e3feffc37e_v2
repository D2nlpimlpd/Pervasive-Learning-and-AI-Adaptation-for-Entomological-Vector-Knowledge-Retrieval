As a type locality, ZERNEST holds taxonomic significance because it is the geographic site where these species were first collected and formally described by scientists. The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the specific place where a species is initially documented, serving as a critical reference for its classification and identification. For *Paraprosalpia denticauda*, ZERNEST is explicitly noted as the European location associated with its type locality, while *Paraprosalpia pilitarsis* is also linked to ZERNEST as the European site from which its type specimens originated. This dual designation underscores ZERNEST's role in entomological research, particularly in the study of the *Paraprosalpia* genus, which is part of the family Tachinidae (parasitoid flies). The presence of these species in ZERNEST likely reflects the region’s ecological characteristics, such as habitat diversity or specific environmental conditions, that support their populations. While the descriptions provided do not clarify whether ZERNEST is a single site or multiple locations within Europe, the repeated association of both species with this name suggests it is a recognized and distinct locality in the context of their taxonomic history. The information highlights the importance of ZERNEST in the scientific documentation of European biodiversity, particularly for parasitoid insects. Further details about the exact geographic coordinates, habitat, or historical context of ZERNEST would enhance understanding of its ecological and taxonomic relevance.\",2\n1341,PARAPROSALPIA DENTICAUDA,\"A species of fly described by Zetterstedt in 1838, with male-specific abdominal features and a body length of 7.5 mm.
