It serves as a key platform for entomological research in China and internationally, providing detailed scientific descriptions and data on insect biodiversity. The journal has been instrumental in recording studies of the *Paraprosalpia* genus, including species descriptions and ecological insights into their habitats, behaviors, and interactions. Additionally, it has published descriptions of other species, such as *Delia sphaerobasis*, alongside comprehensive morphological analyses and distributional records that contribute to understanding their geographic ranges and taxonomic classifications. By integrating both ecological and taxonomic research, the journal supports interdisciplinary studies in entomology, offering a repository for findings that enhance knowledge of insect life cycles, population dynamics, and environmental impacts. Its contributions to documenting species like *Paraprosalpia* and *Delia sphaerobasis* highlight its role in preserving and disseminating critical data for conservation, agricultural, and biological research.
