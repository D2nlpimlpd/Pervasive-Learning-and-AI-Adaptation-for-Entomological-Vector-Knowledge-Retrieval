He first described the genus *Emmesomyia* in 1917, establishing a foundational classification in the field. MALLOCH’s work spanned multiple genera, including *Atherigona* (1925–1928), where he documented species such as *A. oryzae*, *A. tridens*, and *A. simplex*, as well as *Rypellia* (1931) and *Cephalispa* (1935). He also described the genus *Xenotachina* in 1921 and *Lasiopelta* in 1928.  \n\nIn species-level taxonomy, MALLOCH’s contributions include *Musca formosana* (1925), the Formosan housefly, first described in the *Zool.Anz. (Leipzig)* journal, and *Isomyia cupreoviridis* (1928) in *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.*. He named *Dichaetomyia setifemur* (1928) and *Dichaetomyia flavocaudata* (1921), as well as *Haematostoma austeni* and *Neomyia fletcheri*. Notable species attributed to him include *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri* (1919), *Helina hirtifemorata* (1926), *Haematobia australis* (1932), *Thricops coquilletti* (1920), and *Nupedia fulva* (1934). Additionally, he described *Eutrichota magna* and *Eutrichota labradorensis* (1920), *Xenosia tarsalia* and *Xenosia scutellaris* (1935), and *Bengalia (Eubengalia) emarginata* (1927). Chinese-named species such as 黑瓣莫蝇 (*Xenosia* sp., 1928) and 毛股阳蝇 (unspecified species) were also documented by him.  \n\nMALLOCH conducted significant ecological and taxonomic studies, including a 1927 investigation on the distribution of *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and broader research on fly larvae ecology in 1923 and 1929. His 1927 Sulawesi study further expanded knowledge of regional dipteran biodiversity. He also described *Tainanina sarcophagoides* (1931) and *Neohelina* (1924), a genus within the family Muscidae.  \n\nHis work appeared in prominent journals such as *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.*, *Zool.Anz. (Leipzig)*, and *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica*. MALLOCH’s legacy includes the classification of *FLAVOCAUDATA* and *SETIFEMUR DICHAETOMYIA* species, as well as the description of *Myospila flavibasis* (1925), *Myospila femorata* (1935), and *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* (1922). He also contributed to the taxonomy of *Chaetolispa* and *Xenolispa* in 1922 and 1923, respectively.  \n\nDespite some inconsistencies in the data (e.g., overlapping descriptions of *Atherigona* species and genera like *Rypellia* cited with varying years), MALLOCH’s primary focus was on the Diptera order, particularly flies in the families Muscidae, Syrphidae, and others. His work remains a critical reference for understanding early 20th-century entomological classifications, especially in Southeast Asia and North America.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",53\n2314,RYPELLIA,\"A closely related genus to Pyrellia, described by Malloch, with distinct morphological features\",2\n2532,三齿芒蝇,\"A species of fly (Atherigona tridens Malloch, 1928) with H-shaped tail segments.

Morphologically, species in this genus are distinguished by a **slightly forward-projecting frons triangle**, a feature that contributes to their unique head structure. The **frons width** is approximately **1/5 of the head width**, emphasizing a relatively narrow central region of the head. Their **eyes** are notable for having a **height significantly greater than their length**, creating a vertically elongated appearance. Additionally, the **lower half of the eye is distinctly concave**, a characteristic that differentiates them from closely related genera. Beyond head features, CEPHALISPA is also recognized for **distinct wing features**, though specific details about these traits are not elaborated in the provided data. The combination of these head and wing characteristics solidifies their classification within the Coenosiini tribe, which is known for diverse and specialized morphological adaptations among fruit flies. This genus exemplifies the taxonomic complexity of the tribe, with its unique anatomical traits aiding in identification and ecological studies. The emphasis on eye and frons morphology aligns with broader patterns in tephritid flies, where such features often play roles in species recognition and behavior. While the descriptions focus on structural attributes, further research into their biology, distribution, or ecological interactions could enhance understanding of their evolutionary significance within the tribe.
