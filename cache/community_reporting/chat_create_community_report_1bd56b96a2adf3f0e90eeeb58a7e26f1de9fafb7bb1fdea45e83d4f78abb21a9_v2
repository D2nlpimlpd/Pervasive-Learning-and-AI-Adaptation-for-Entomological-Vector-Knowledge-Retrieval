It is distributed in Qinghai (type locality) domestically\",3\n343,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,\"\n\nROBINEAU-DESVOIDY was a 19th-century French entomologist and taxonomist renowned for his extensive contributions to the classification of flies, particularly parasitic species. Active primarily in the 1830s and 1860s, he described numerous genera and species, many of which remain foundational in modern entomology. In 1830, he established or described key genera such as *Aplomyia*, *Adia*, *Spallanzania*, *Mydaea*, *Myospila*, *Egenia*, *Hydrotaea*, *Nemoraea*, *Caricea*, *Limosia*, *Agria*, *Carcelia*, *Helina*, *Morellia*, *Amobia*, *Norellia*, *Pegomya*, *Hylemya*, *Fannia*, *Lucilia*, *Melinda*, *Pyrellia*, and *Phormia*. Notable species from this period include *Calliphora vicina* (Red-headed Calliphora), *Delia floricola*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Lydella maesta*, *Lydella cursoria*, *Hydrotaea cinerea*, *Leucophora cinerea*, *Leucophora sericea*, *Craspedochoeta liturata*, *Cynomya* species, and *Pollenia* in 1830. He also described *Dexia cincta* and *Dexia gracilis*, as well as *Blondelia*, *Meigenia*, and *Zaira* genera.  \n\nBy 1863, Robineau-Desvoidy expanded his work to include genera like *Phryxe* (e.g., *Phryxe praefixa*, *Phryxe fugitiva*, *Phryxe vernalis*), *Eurysthaea* (including *Eurysthaea scutellaris* in 1848 and *Eurysthaea* species in 1863), *Servaisia*, *Pierretia*, *Ravinia*, *Bercaea*, and *Bengalia*. He also described species such as *Macquartia laeta* (1863), *Macquartia villica* (1836), *Blaesoxipha campestris*, *Buquetia musca*, and *Emmesomyia grisea*. His 1863 contributions further solidified his role in tachinid fly taxonomy, with genera like *Lydella*, *Platymyia*, *Zenillia*, and *Buquetia* being highlighted as part of his broader work on parasitic flies.  \n\nRobineau-Desvoidy’s research spanned both morphological and ecological classifications, with a focus on the Palearctic region. He is credited with describing *Egle parva* (1830) and the genus *Egle*, as well as *Delia floricola* and *Myxexoristops blondeli*. His work on *Phorbia* (1830) and *Linnaemya* (1830) added to the understanding of fly diversity. Additionally, he described species such as *Peletieria rubescens* (1830) and *Calythea nigricans* (1830), and contributed to the subgenus *Pierretia (s.str.)* in 1863.  \n\nDespite some inconsistencies in the data (e.g., conflicting years for *Bercaea* and *Eurysthaea*), his legacy is marked by a prolific output in the 1830s and 1860s, with over 30 genera and dozens of species attributed to him. His efforts in organizing parasitic fly taxonomy, including *Aplomyia*, *Phryxe*, and *Lydella*, remain significant. Robineau-Desvoidy’s work on species like *蓝翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis* and *四鬃翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens* (translated as *Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis* and *Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens*) and the *朔粪泉蝇* (likely *Sphingomyia* or a related species) further underscores his global impact.  \n\nAs a French scientist, he was instrumental in advancing 19th-century entomology, with his descriptions of genera like *Drino*, *Cosmina*, and *Bellardia* reflecting his methodical approach to taxonomy. His work on *Chrysomya* (1830) and *Limnophora nigripes* also highlights his role in defining key fly lineages. Overall, Robineau-Desvoidy’s contributions to the classification of Diptera, particularly parasitic and blow flies, remain a cornerstone of entomological science.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",112\n3709,蜗蝇属,\"蜗蝇属 (Melinda) is a genus of flies with black thorax, green or olive abdominal coloration, and specific male and female reproductive structures.

It is characterized by a suite of morphological traits that distinguish it from other genera in the tribe. Notably, Lydella species possess crossed scutellar bristles, a feature observed on the scutellum (a triangular plate on the thorax). Additionally, they exhibit a specific 2:2 pattern of abdominal bristles, which refers to the arrangement of bristles on the abdominal segments. Another defining characteristic is the presence of a row of black bristles located behind the postocular bristles on the occiput, the posterior region of the head. These traits, including the wing bristle counts mentioned in the first description, collectively contribute to the taxonomic identification of Lydella within the Tachinidae family. The genus is part of the Eryciini tribe, a group of tachinid flies known for their parasitoid lifestyles, often targeting lepidopteran larvae. The combination of these morphological features—crossed scutellar bristles, abdominal bristle configuration, and occipital black bristles—provides a cohesive framework for classifying Lydella species and understanding their ecological and evolutionary roles. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they complement each other in detailing the genus’s diagnostic characteristics.\",2\n5746,PHRYXE,\"\n\nPHRYXE is a genus of parasitic tachinid flies within the family Tachinidae, first described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. The genus is characterized by its ovoviviparous reproductive strategy, a trait common among tachinid flies where eggs develop inside the mother until they are ready to be laid. Members of PHRYXE, such as the species *Phryxe vulgaris*, exhibit a distinct black body coloration, which is a prominent morphological feature. Additionally, they possess a red-yellowish tip on the scutellum, a triangular plate on the thorax, that serves as a key identifier for the genus. \n\nPHRYXE species are further distinguished by specific bristle arrangements on their mesotibia, the middle segment of the hind leg. These include two frontal bristles and three anterior dorsal bristles, which are critical for taxonomic classification within the genus. The combination of these traits—black bodies, red-yellowish scutellum tips, and the defined bristle patterns—help differentiate PHRYXE from other tachinid genera. As parasitic flies, they play a role in regulating populations of their host insects, though specific host preferences are not detailed in the provided data. The genus remains a subject of entomological study due to its ecological significance and morphological distinctiveness. \n\nBy integrating the descriptions, PHRYXE is confirmed as a tachinid fly genus with a historical taxonomic foundation, unique coloration, and specialized bristle structures, all contributing to its classification and biological role.\",2\n5846,NEMORAEA,\"\n\n**NEMORAEA** is a genus of flies within the tribe Nemoraeini, first described by the entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. The genus is characterized by a suite of morphological features that distinguish it from other members of its tribe. These include the presence of three abdominal bristles, a specific bristle arrangement on the thorax, and a hairy lower surstylus, which is a structure located on the male genitalia. Additionally, species in the genus exhibit a face ridge, a unique facial feature, and specialized abdominal and wing structures that contribute to their taxonomic identification. The combination of these traits—such as the thoracic bristle pattern, the hairy surstylus, and the face ridge—provides a comprehensive framework for classifying and differentiating *Nemoraea* species.  \n\nOne well-documented example within the genus is *Nemoraea pellucida*, which exemplifies the defining characteristics of the group. This species, like others in the genus, is likely to display the three abdominal bristles, the specific thoracic bristle arrangement, and the hairy lower surstylus. The wing and abdominal structures, though not explicitly detailed in the descriptions, are noted as key diagnostic elements, suggesting that these features may vary in form or venation patterns among species but remain consistent within the genus. The face ridge, a prominent trait, further aids in distinguishing *Nemoraea* from closely related genera.  \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in their attribution of the genus to Robineau-Desvoidy (1830) and its placement within the Nemoraeini tribe. While the first description emphasizes abdominal and thoracic bristle arrangements, the second adds details about the surstylus, face ridge, and wing/abdominal structures, all of which are integrated into the summary to reflect the full range of diagnostic traits. The inclusion of *Nemoraea pellucida* as a representative species ensures clarity about the genus's diversity and provides a concrete reference for its morphological features.  \n\nIn summary, *Nemoraea* is a taxonomically distinct genus of flies within the Nemoraeini tribe, defined by its unique combination of bristle patterns, a hairy lower surstylus, a face ridge, and specialized wing and abdominal structures. These characteristics, along with the historical context of its description, underscore its classification and help identify species such as *Nemoraea pellucida* within the group. The synthesis of the provided data resolves any implicit redundancy while maintaining a cohesive and detailed overview of the genus.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",2\n347,NORELLIA PSEUDONARCISI,,1\n648,EGLE PARVA,,1\n1543,EMMESOMYIA GRISEA,,1\n1796,HYDROTAEA CINEREA,A species of fly described by Robineau-Desvoidy,1\n1811,ESSAI MYOD.,Journal where Hydrotaea velutina was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830,1\n1817,ESS.MYOD.511.,A journal or publication where Hydrotaea cinerea was described by Robineau-Desvoidy,1\n2052,FAR EAST SIBERIA,,1\n2380,蓝翠蝇NEOMYIA (ORTHELLIA) TIMORENSIS,,1\n2583,MYOSPIRA,\"A genus of flies described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830, with features including bare wings and distinct abdominal patterns\",1\n2810,LIMOSIA,\"A genus of flies with antennae inserted at the upper third of the eye, a narrow frons (about 1/3 of head width), and parallel lateral margins\",1\n2820,短角秽蝇属LIMOSIA,\"Limosia is a genus described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830.

Specifically, it is recognized as the source in which the genus *Bengalia* was first described by the French entomologist **Robineau-Desvoidy** in 1830. This publication serves as a key reference for the taxonomic classification of the genus, which is part of the broader scientific documentation of insect species. The entity \"\"ESS. MYOD.\"\" likely represents an abbreviated or shorthand form of the journal's title, though the full name is not provided in the data. Its significance lies in its contribution to the formal naming and categorization of *Bengalia*, a genus that may be associated with a particular family or group of insects, depending on the context of Robineau-Desvoidy's work. The descriptions provided align in identifying the entity as a publication, with the first offering a specific historical detail about its content and the second emphasizing its general role as a referenced journal. Together, they establish ESS. MYOD. as a scholarly work from 1830 that advanced the understanding of insect taxonomy through the introduction of *Bengalia*. The summary resolves no contradictions, as both descriptions are consistent in their identification of the entity as a publication tied to Robineau-Desvoidy's 1830 work on the genus.

This information is consistently presented in both descriptions provided, which note that Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus *Lydella* in 1830, with the first description using the capitalized form \"\"LYDELLA\"\" and the second using the lowercase \"\"Lydella.\"\" The discrepancy in capitalization is resolved by recognizing that genus names in scientific taxonomy are typically italicized and follow binomial nomenclature conventions, where the genus name is capitalized and the specific epithet is lowercase. However, in this case, the entity \"\"LYDELLA\"\" is explicitly listed as the genus, and the descriptions confirm its attribution to Robineau-Desvoidy. \n\nThe summary clarifies that **ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY** (full name: **Pierre-Étienne Robineau-Desvoidy**) made this taxonomic contribution in the 19th century, a period marked by significant advancements in the classification of insect species. The genus **LYDELLA** is part of the family **Bombycidae**, which includes silk moths, though the specific characteristics or species within this genus are not detailed in the provided data. The year 1830 is critical for establishing the priority of the name under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, ensuring that **LYDELLA** is recognized as the valid genus name if no subsequent revisions or conflicts have arisen. \n\nNo contradictions exist in the descriptions, as both align on the authorship, the year of description, and the entity being described. The summary integrates these details into a coherent statement, emphasizing the taxonomic significance of Robineau-Desvoidy’s work and the formal naming of **LYDELLA**. This information is concise and adheres to the third-person perspective, with entity names included for clarity and context.

The genus was **established and described by the French entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830**. Robineau-Desvoidy, whose full name is often cited as **Joseph-Émile Robineau-Desvoidy**, was a prominent figure in 19th-century taxonomy, particularly known for his contributions to the classification of Diptera (true flies). His formal establishment of *Nemoraea* in 1830 marked a significant step in organizing the biodiversity of parasitoid flies, which play critical ecological roles as natural pest controllers. The genus *Nemoraea* is characterized by specific morphological traits, such as wing venation patterns and body structures, that distinguish it within the Tachinidae family. Robineau-Desvoidy’s work on *Nemoraea* reflects his broader efforts to systematize and document insect genera during a period of rapid taxonomic discovery. While the descriptions provided do not elaborate further on the genus’s species or ecological significance, the foundational act of its establishment by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830 remains a key historical reference in entomological literature. This dual action of describing and establishing the genus underscores his role in shaping early classifications of parasitic flies, which continue to inform modern biological studies.\",114\n282,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,NORELLIA PSEUDONARCISI,Robineau-Desvoidy named the species Norellia pseudonarcissi in 1830,113\n634,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,EGLE PARVA,Robineau-Desvoidy is the describer of the species Egle parva,113\n2464,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,EMMESOMYIA GRISEA,Robineau-Desvoidy is an author who described the species Emmesomyia grisea,113\n2974,HYDROTAEA CINEREA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described Hydrotaea cinerea,113\n3032,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,ESSAI MYOD.,Robineau-Desvoidy published the description of Hydrotaea velutina in the journal Essai Myod.,113\n3057,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,ESS.MYOD.511.,Robineau-Desvoidy described Hydrotaea cinerea in the journal Ess.Myod.511.,113\n3461,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,FAR EAST SIBERIA,Robineau-Desvoidy's species is distributed in the Soviet Union's Far East Siberia region,113\n4062,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,蓝翠蝇NEOMYIA (ORTHELLIA) TIMORENSIS,Robineau-Desvoidy described the species 蓝翠蝇 in 1830,113\n4528,MYOSPIRA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Myospila genus was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830,113\n5028,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,LIMOSIA,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Limosia,113\n5039,短角秽蝇属LIMOSIA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Limosia in 1830,113\n7447,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,\"POLLENIA ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY, 1830\",Robineau-Desvoidy is the author of the genus Pollenia,113\n7617,CHRYSOMYA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Chrysomya in 1830,113\n7720,PHORMIA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Phormia in 1830,113\n8491,OEBALIA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Oebalia was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863,113\n8492,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,PHROSINELLA,Phrosinella was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863,113\n9092,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,BERCAEA,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Bercaea,113\n9691,MYOPHORA PEREGRINA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy originally described Myophora peregrina in 1830,113\n10313,PERIBAEA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Peribaea in 1863,113\n10322,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,HERBSTIA,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Herbstia in 1851,113\n10556,BLONDELIA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Blondelia in 1830,113\n11162,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,PLATYMYIA,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Platymyia in 1830,113\n11253,LYDELLA MAESTA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Lydella maesta was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863,113\n11254,LYDELLA CURSORIA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Lydella cursoria was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863,113\n11275,PHRYXE PRAEFIXA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Phryxe praefixa was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863,113\n11276,PHRYXE FUGITIVA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Phryxe fugitiva was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863,113\n11277,PHRYXE VERNALIS,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Phryxe vernalis was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863,113\n11493,MACQUARTIA LAETA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described Macquartia laeta in 1863,113\n11494,MACQUARTIA VILLLICA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described Macquartia villica in 1836,113\n11635,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,DEXIA CINCTA,Robineau-Desvoidy described the species Dexia cincta in 1830,113\n11636,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,DEXIA GRACILIS,Robineau-Desvoidy described the species Dexia gracilis in 1830,113\n10884,ESSAI MYODAIRES,CARCELIAS BOMBYCIVORA,\"Carcelia bombycivora is described in the publication \"\"Essai Myodaires\"\"\",19\n8072,PERIS,PROC.LINN.SOC.,Peris provided distribution data for species in this journal,17\n1006,NORTHERN INDIA,HYLEMIA STRENUA,The genus Hylemya is found in Northern India,8\n3876,CHINESE IMPORTANT MEDICAL ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION HANDBOOK,PYRELLIA VIVIDA,The handbook documents Pyrellia vivida,5\n7526,ESS.
