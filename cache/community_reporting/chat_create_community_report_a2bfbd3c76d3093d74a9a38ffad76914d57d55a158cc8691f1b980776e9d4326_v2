Among the species described in its pages are *Isomyia cupreoviridis* and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, both of which are associated with the genus *Isomyia*. The latter, *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, was specifically described by the entomologist Malloch in 1928, highlighting the journal’s role in advancing taxonomic work during the early 20th century.
