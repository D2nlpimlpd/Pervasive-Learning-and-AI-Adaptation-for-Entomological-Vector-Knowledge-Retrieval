Active in both taxonomic research and ecological documentation, KANO's work spans multiple regions, including Japan, Micronesia, and Taiwan, and involves collaborations with other scientists. Their earliest recorded contribution dates to 1950, when they described the species *拟野亚麻蝇* (likely *Ph. fuscitibia* or a related *Phaonia* species). In 1953 and 1954, KANO authored multiple references to *1339上海细麻蝇* (possibly *Ph. xanthofemina*), and in 1956, they co-described *Sarcophaga furutonensis* with Okazaki and *Sarcophaga shiroganensis* with another collaborator.  \n\nKANO's 1960s work includes foundational studies on the genus *Xanthotryxus* in 1968, as well as co-authoring a 1968 study on fly species characteristics referenced in broader literature. They were also involved in documenting the distribution of flies in Micronesia in 1968, alongside other researchers. Notably, KANO described the species *Melinda itoi* in 1962 and co-authored a 1968 study on *Melinda* species. In 1964, they co-described *Robineauella (D.) uemotoi*, and in 1966, they contributed to the description of *Protocalliphora maruyamensis*. Additionally, KANO is cited as an author for the type locality of *Brontaea ezensis* and for studies on *Phaonia bambusa*, *Phaonia luteovittata*, and *Phaonia ryukyuensis*.  \n\nThe 1970s saw KANO's continued focus on taxonomic classifications, including co-establishing the *Horia* genus in 1967 and studying the genus *Neomyia* in 1973. They also co-described *Sarcosolomonia harinasutai* in 1977 and *Ophyra okazakii* in 1971. In 1973, KANO was associated with a report on fly species, and their work on *Stomoxys uruma* (co-described with Shinonaga in 1966) and *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Paradichosia tsukamotoi* further highlights their expertise in dipteran taxonomy.  \n\nKANO's research also extended to the 1980s, with studies on species differences in 1983 and 1987. They were cited for specimen collection in Japan and for the distribution of *Pyrellia cyanicolor* in Taiwan. Their collaborations often involved prominent entomologists, as seen in co-authoring works on *Gymnadichosia pusilla* and *Pollenomyia okazakii*.  \n\nOverall, KANO's career reflects a deep engagement with the taxonomy and ecology of flies, particularly within the *Phaonia*, *Melinda*, and *Sarcophaga* genera. Their work, frequently collaborative, advanced the understanding of species distribution, morphological characteristics, and regional biodiversity in Asia. Key publications include studies on *Xanthotryxus* (1968), *Horia* (1967), and multiple *Phaonia* species, alongside contributions to the classification of *Stomoxys uruma* and *Ophyra okazakii*. KANO's legacy is marked by meticulous documentation and the establishment of new taxonomic frameworks, solidifying their role as a pivotal figure in entomological research during the 20th century.\",29\n1745,SHINONAGA,\"\n\nSHINONAGA, a Japanese entomologist, is recognized for his significant contributions to the taxonomy and distribution studies of dipteran species, particularly flies, across Asia and the Pacific. His work spans multiple decades, with notable publications beginning in 1966. In that year, he co-authored the description of *Protocalliphora maruyamensis* and, alongside Kano, described *Stomoxys uruma*. By 1968, Shinonaga was actively involved in documenting the distribution of flies in Micronesia, collaborating with Kano on a study of *Melinda* species and contributing to a broader 1968 report on fly species characteristics. He also co-authored the 1968 documentation of *Neomyia indica* in Thailand and was cited for specimen collection in Japan.  \n\nIn 1969, Shinonaga expanded his research to include the study of *Iranihindia*, a genus of flies. The following year, 1970, marked his description of *Neomyia ruficornis*, further solidifying his expertise in the *Neomyia* genus. In 1973, he co-authored a fly species report and conducted a detailed study of the *Neomyia* genus, demonstrating his ongoing focus on this group. His 1979 work was particularly prolific: he proposed the synonymy of *Pierretia melania* for *Dinemomyia nigribasicosta*, co-established the genus *Kanomyia*, and described the genus *Hosarcophaga*. Additionally, he co-described *Huckettomyia watanabei* and *Megophyra simpliceps*, and was associated with the species *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Paradichosia tsukamotoi*.  \n\nShinonaga’s taxonomic contributions include the description of several species, such as *Phaonia bambusa*, *Phaonia fuscitibia*, *Phaonia ryukyuensis*, and *Ophyra okazakii*, as well as the genus *Xanthotryxus* in 1968. He also provided the type locality for *Brontaea ezensis*, a critical detail for its classification. His collaborative efforts, particularly with Kano, were instrumental in advancing the understanding of fly biodiversity in regions like Japan, Micronesia, and Taiwan, as evidenced by his co-authorship on the 1966 *Protocalliphora maruyamensis* and 1968 *Melinda* species studies.  \n\nShinonaga’s work reflects a multidisciplinary approach, addressing both regional distribution patterns and morphological characteristics of dipteran taxa. His research on *Tricholioproctia flavinervis* synonymy and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* in Taiwan highlights his role in clarifying taxonomic relationships and geographic ranges. Through these efforts, Shinonaga has left a lasting impact on the field of entomology, particularly in the systematic study of flies in East Asia and the Pacific. His publications remain foundational references for understanding the diversity and classification of these insects.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",25\n1736,PASSEROMYIA HETEROCHAETA,\"\n\n**Passeromyia heterochaeta**, also known as *异芒雀蝇* in Chinese, is a species of fly characterized by distinct morphological and ecological traits. It is distributed across multiple continents, including Japan, China, India, Africa, Oceania, and both North and South America.

This research was part of the *Fauna Japan* project, a significant taxonomic and ecological reference for Japanese fauna. The same 1971 study also marked their involvement in broader entomological research, though specific details about the scope of this work remain tied to their description of *Phaonia bambusa*.  \n\nIn 1973, SHINONAGA ET KANO expanded their contributions by focusing on the larval stages of insects, providing detailed descriptions that advanced understanding of developmental morphology in the field. This work, while not specifying a particular species, highlights their expertise in life cycle studies, which are critical for ecological and taxonomic research.  \n\nTheir most prominent achievement, however, came in 1977 with the description of the *Asian housefly* (*Musca asiatica*), a species distinct from the more commonly studied *Musca domestica*. This work likely addressed the taxonomy, distribution, or biological characteristics of *Musca asiatica*, contributing to the differentiation of housefly species in Asia.  \n\nCollectively, SHINONAGA ET KANO’s research underscores their role in documenting Japanese insect biodiversity, with a focus on both adult and larval forms. Their 1971 *Phaonia bambusa* study, linked to *Fauna Japan*, and their 1977 work on the Asian housefly demonstrate their impact on taxonomic science, while the 1973 larval descriptions reflect their methodological rigor in entomological research. Though the descriptions provided do not clarify the exact nature of their 1971 study beyond *Phaonia bambusa*, it is reasonable to infer that their 1971 and 1973 works were part of a cohesive effort to catalog and analyze insect life stages and species in Japan. Their legacy remains tied to foundational contributions in the 1970s, advancing knowledge of dipteran taxonomy and ecology.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",3\n3314,PHAONIA KATOI,,3\n6235,1967 STUDY,,2\n1537,HOKKAIDO OBIHIRO,Hokkaido Obihiro is a specific location in Japan where Muscidae subfamilies are distributed,1\n2559,TAKAHASHI YUICHI,Author of Atherigona biseta in Japan,1\n4071,ISHII,Ishii is an author cited in the text for a 1954 reference to Japan,1\n4072,NARUSE,Naruse is an author cited in the text for a reference to Japan,1\n2153,NAGATA,Location in Japan part of Musca conducens distribution,1\n4073,KOSUGAYA,Kosugaya is an author cited in the text for a reference to Japan,1\n6212,KANO ROKURŌ,Author of the Japanese larval guide mentioned in the text,1\n523,CHIROSIA BETULETI,\"\n\n**Chirosia betuleti** is a species of fly within the genus *Chirosia*, first described by Ringdahl in 1935.

The genus is taxonomically divided into two subgenera: *Pycnoglossa* and *Chirosia s. str.* (sensu stricto). Morphologically, a defining characteristic of *Chirosia* is the absence of flaps on the male fifth abdominal plates, as well as the lack of inner branches on the side tail leaf (a structure associated with the male genitalia). These features distinguish the genus from related taxa within the fly family. The subgeneric classification likely reflects further morphological or phylogenetic distinctions among species, though specific details about the subgenera’s differentiation are not provided in the descriptions. The genus is part of the broader fly taxonomy, with its nomenclature and classification rooted in 19th-century entomological research. While the descriptions focus on male anatomical traits, the inclusion of subgenera suggests ongoing taxonomic study to refine groupings within the genus.

Active primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, SUWA described numerous species and genera, including the genus *Meliniella* in 1974, with its type species *Meliniella sikisima*, and the genus *Shakshainia*, introducing the species *Shakshainia rametoka*. Their work on *Pegohylemyia* is notable, as they documented multiple species such as *Pegohylemyia tridentifera* (1986), *Pegohylemyia spinisternata* (1974), *Pegohylemyia nigrigenis*, *Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes*, and *Pegohylemyia maculipedella* in publications like the *Insect Research Journal* and *Chinese Economic Insect Monograph*. SUWA also described *Pegomya japonica* (1974), *Pegomya nigra* (1974), and its subspecies *Pegomya japonica mokanensis*, alongside *Hydrophoria montana* (1970) and *Phorbia pilostyla* (1977). \n\nIn addition to species descriptions, SUWA contributed to understanding host plant associations and geographic distributions of flies, including *Pegomya* species, and was cited in works related to *Phorbia fascicularis* in Japan. They also documented *Delia karasawana* (1974) and *Delia takizawai* (1974), as well as *Hylemya nigrimana* and *Hylemya femoralis*. SUWA’s research extended to *Chionomyia vetula* (1974) and *Paraprosalpia silvatica* (1974), with the latter being described twice in the data. Their work often appeared in Japanese entomological literature, reflecting a focus on regional biodiversity. \n\nThe entity’s name is associated with both scientific and Chinese vernacular species names, such as 黄跗粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya melatrochanter*), 喜马拉雅粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya criniventris*), 东方粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya nigra*), and 长板粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya japonica mokanensis*), as well as 亚山花蝇 (*Hyporites shakshain*). SUWA’s legacy includes foundational taxonomic studies that remain referenced in subsequent research on fly distributions and ecology. Their work in 1974 was particularly prolific, establishing multiple genera and species, while their 1970 and 1977 studies expanded on host plant interactions and regional faunal records. Despite some repetition in the data, all contributions consistently attribute to SUWA, underscoring their role as a key figure in Japanese entomology.\",35\n1099,圆斑莠蝇EUSTALOMYIA HILARIS,,7\n477,MELINIELLA,\"\n\n**Meliniella** is a genus of flies distinguished by a suite of morphological characteristics in both males and females. Males are notable for their narrow foreheads and the presence of interfrontal bristles, while females exhibit distinct abdominal structures. A key diagnostic feature of the genus is the male fifth abdominal segment, which bears a single bristle on its anterior margin and plates with inner flaps, as described by Landia Hennig (1973) and Suwa (1974). Additionally, the anal tail leaf in Meliniella species often ends with an inward curl, further differentiating them from related genera. The genus is also characterized by the absence of certain bristles, such as those found in *Shakshainia* (Suwa) and *Craspedochoeta* (Macq.), and by narrower postabdominal side lobes compared to these genera. \n\nSpecies within *Meliniella* include *Meliniella sikisima* and *Meliniella griseifrons*, which exemplify the genus’s defining traits. The body length of these flies typically ranges from 4.5 to 9.0 mm, as noted in comparative studies. The male abdominal morphology is particularly critical for identification, with the fifth abdominal plates featuring inner flaps and side tail leaf inner branches, which are absent in the genera used for differentiation. These structural details, combined with the narrow postabdominal side lobes, provide a clear taxonomic basis for separating *Meliniella* from *Shakshainia* and *Craspedochoeta*. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize the importance of abdominal and bristle-related features in distinguishing *Meliniella* from closely related taxa. While the first description highlights the absence of specific bristles and narrower side lobes, the second and third descriptions elaborate on the male-specific traits, such as the single bristle on the fifth abdominal segment and the inward curling anal tail leaf. These features are consistent across the provided sources, with no direct contradictions. The references to Landia Hennig (1973) and Suwa (1974) underscore the historical context of the genus’s taxonomic classification. \n\nIn summary, *Meliniella* is a fly genus defined by male morphological traits including a narrow forehead, interfrontal bristles, a single bristle on the fifth abdominal segment, and abdominal plates with inner flaps and side tail leaf inner branches. The inward curling of the anal tail leaf and narrower postabdominal side lobes further distinguish it from *Shakshainia* and *Craspedochoeta*. With species like *M. sikisima* and *M. griseifrons*, the genus is well-characterized by its unique anatomical features and size range, making it a distinct group within the fly family.\",10\n3305,PHAONIA FUSCITIBIA,,4\n1347,PARAPROSALPIA SILVATICA,\"A species of fly described by Suwa in 1974, with specific abdominal and wing features.
