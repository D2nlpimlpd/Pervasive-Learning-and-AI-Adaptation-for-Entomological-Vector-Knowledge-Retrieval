The province also hosts **Metopia** species like *Metopia pollenia*, *Metopia auripulvera*, and *Metopia suifenhoensis*, with records in Yajiang, Xiangcheng, and other areas. **Drymeia** species, including *Drymeia cinerascens*, *Drymeia brevifacies*, and *Drymeia grapsopoda*, are found in Sichuan, alongside **Phaonia** species such as *Phaonia bruneaurea*, *Phaonia hebeta*, *Phaonia suberrans*, and *Phaonia mimoincana*, with specific localities like Erlang Mountain and Emei Mountain noted. \n\nSichuan’s biodiversity includes **Musca** species like *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca larvipara*, and *Musca crassirostris*, as well as **Hemipyrellia liguriens** in Ya’an and **Myospila fuscicoxa** with a type locality at Emei Mountain. The province is also a key location for **Paradichosia** species, such as *Paradichosia chuanbeiensis* and *Paradichosia kangdingensis*, and **Xanthotryxus** and **Dexopollenia** species. Notable localities within Sichuan include **Kangding** (type locality for *Mydaea setifemur kongdinga*), **Makeng** (for *Thricops coquilletti*), **Erlang Mountain** (for *Phaonia chuanierrans* and *Helina punctifemoralis*), and **Emei Mountain** (type locality for *Hydrophoria megaloba* and *Helina dibrachiata*). \n\nAdditional species documented in Sichuan include **Lydella grisescens**, **Atherigona reversura**, **Thecocarcelia parnarae**, **Tachina nupta**, **Servillia planiforceps**, **Servillia ardens**, **GENUFORCEPS SARCOPHAGA**, **Sichuan Oestroderma**, **1431家蚕追寄蝇** (a parasitic fly), **翼阳细麻蝇**, **戛斗细麻蝇**, **Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri** (E’meishan), **Calliphora axata** (Chongqing), **Calliphora chinghaiensis** (Batang), **Cynomyiomima stackelbergi**, **Cynomya mortuorum**, **Cuphocera varia**, **Nemoraea pellucida**, **Pegohylemya fugax**, **Pegohylemyia sichuanensis**, **Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes**, **Pegomya bicolor**, **Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis**, and **Pegomya folifera**. The region supports **Parasarcophaga nanpingensis**, **Polleniopsis varilata**, **Sinohylemya**, **Bessa**, **Yibin Fannia**, **尾须厕蝇**, **秉氏亚麻蝇**, **义乌亚麻蝇**, and **棕尾别麻蝇**, with cities like Jintang, Ya’an, Mianyang, and regions such as Litang Kangka (3700m) and Wolong also highlighted. \n\nSichuan is further associated with the host species **粘虫** (a type of caterpillar) and is linked to the Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing for domestic entomological studies. The province’s varied ecosystems, including high-altitude areas and mountainous regions, contribute to its role as a hotspot for fly and insect diversity, with species like *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis*, *Heteronychia macromembrana*, and *Alloeostylus rufisquama* recorded. Specific localities such as **Li County Miaoliu**, **Ganzi**, and **Miyao** are noted for their ecological significance in supporting these species. \n\nThis summary consolidates Sichuan’s extensive entomological records, emphasizing its importance as a center for studying both common and rare fly species, with many type localities and multiple genera (e.g., *Parasarcophaga*, *Phaonia*, *Drymeia*) represented across its cities and natural features.\",185\n1920,HENGDUAN MOUNTAINS INSECTS,\"\n\nThe **Hengduan Mountains Insects** are a subject of significant scientific interest due to the region's unique biodiversity and ecological complexity. The Hengduan Mountains, a mountain range in southwestern China spanning Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces, host a rich array of insect species, many of which are endemic or understudied. Two notable studies have contributed to the documentation of this fauna. The first, published in a journal, describes two species of the genus *Phaonia*—*Phaonia mimobasiseta* and *Phaonia caudilata*—in volume 2, page 1237. These species, likely blowflies (family Calliphoridae), are part of the broader research into the region's dipteran diversity, which plays critical roles in ecosystems as decomposers, pollinators, and food sources. The second study focuses on *Drymeia* species, a genus within the family Muscidae, and documents their presence in the same provinces (Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai). This publication highlights the taxonomic and ecological significance of *Drymeia* in the Hengduan Mountains, emphasizing the area's role as a hotspot for muscid fly diversity. Together, these works underscore the importance of the Hengduan Mountains as a key region for entomological research, where both *Phaonia* and *Drymeia* species contribute to the understanding of local insect communities. The studies also reflect the fragmented yet growing body of knowledge about the area's insects, with each publication addressing distinct genera and geographic subsets. While the first study provides specific taxonomic details for *Phaonia* species, the second expands the scope to *Drymeia*, illustrating the range of dipteran adaptations in the region's varied habitats. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they reference separate species and publications. Collectively, they reinforce the Hengduan Mountains' status as a vital area for conserving and studying insect biodiversity, with ongoing research continuing to uncover new species and ecological relationships. These findings are essential for informing conservation strategies and understanding the impacts of environmental changes on fragile alpine and subtropical ecosystems.\",5\n5119,1352 LINGULATE PIERRETIAS,,5\n1981,MESAMBRIANA RESPLENDENS CILIIMACULATA,A subspecies of Mesembrina resplendens described by Fan and Zheng,4\n3871,ONESIA CHUANXIENSIS,\"A species of fly described by Chen et Fan in 1992, with a slender, forward-curved lateral lobe and a hooked terminal process.

This region is characterized by its rugged topography, high biodiversity, and ecological significance, serving as a critical area for scientific research. The Hengduan Mountains are particularly notable for their role in entomological studies, as highlighted in two key references. First, they are referenced in the study of *Drymeia* species, a genus of flies within the family Muscidae, which underscores the area’s importance as a habitat for diverse insect populations. Second, the Hengduan Mountains are associated with the publication *Insects of the Hengduan Mountains*, a work that likely documents the region’s rich insect fauna and contributes to broader understanding of its ecosystems. These studies emphasize the Hengduan Mountains as a hotspot for biodiversity, where unique environmental conditions support specialized species and provide opportunities for taxonomic and ecological research. The mountain range’s geographical complexity, including steep gradients and varied microclimates, further enhances its value as a natural laboratory for investigating evolutionary processes and species adaptation. Collectively, the descriptions position the Hengduan Mountains as a vital region in China for both geographical and biological sciences, particularly in the context of insect diversity and conservation.\",2\n1706,CHONGQING JINYUN SHAN,\"Chongqing Jinyun Mountain in Sichuan, a distribution site for Xenotachina chongqingensis\",1\n1707,CHONGQING NASHAN,\"Chongqing Nanshan in Sichuan, a distribution site for Xenotachina chongqingensis\",1\n2090,JINTANG,\"\n\nJINTANG is a county-level administrative division located in Sichuan Province, China. While one description refers to it as a \"\"city,\"\" this likely reflects a common but imprecise usage of the term in Chinese administrative terminology, where \"\"city\"\" can sometimes encompass both urban and county-level jurisdictions. Officially, Jintang is classified as a county, which is a sub-provincial administrative unit within the province. It is situated in the eastern part of Sichuan, contributing to the region's diverse geographical and cultural landscape.  \n\nThe county is notable for its mention in the taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, a family of flies (Sarcophagidae) in the order Diptera. This reference suggests that Jintang may serve as a type locality or a significant location for the study, classification, or observation of certain Sarcophagini species. Such taxonomic associations often highlight areas with unique ecological conditions or biodiversity, which could be relevant to entomological research in the region. However, the specific scientific context or species linked to Jintang in this key is not detailed in the provided descriptions.  \n\nSichuan Province, where Jintang is located, is known for its mountainous terrain, including parts of the Sichuan Basin and the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The province is also culturally and historically rich, with a history of significant contributions to Chinese civilization. As a county, Jintang would fall under the jurisdiction of a prefecture-level city, though the exact parent city is not specified in the data.  \n\nIn summary, JINTANG is a county in Sichuan Province, China, recognized both as an administrative unit and as a geographical reference in entomological taxonomy. Its dual designation as a \"\"city\"\" and \"\"county\"\" underscores the nuances of Chinese administrative terminology, where lower-level divisions may be colloquially referred to as cities. The mention in the Sarcophagini taxonomic key indicates its relevance to scientific studies, though further details on this connection remain unexplored in the given data. The entity’s role within Sichuan’s administrative framework and its ecological significance, if any, warrant additional context for a more complete understanding.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",1\n2091,FENGJIE,\"Fengjie is a city in Sichuan province, China\",1\n2092,ZHAOJUE,\"\n\nZhaojue is a county-level city located in Sichuan Province, China. It is often described as a city within the province, but its administrative classification as a county-level city clarifies that it functions as a sub-prefectural division, subordinate to a prefecture-level city (though the specific prefecture is not mentioned in the provided data). This dual reference to \"\"city\"\" and \"\"county\"\" reflects the nuanced structure of Chinese administrative divisions, where county-level cities are considered part of the county tier but operate with municipal governance. Zhaojue is also explicitly noted as a county in Sichuan Province, aligning with its role in local governance and regional identity.  \n\nBeyond its administrative context, Zhaojue holds significance in scientific literature, particularly in the taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, a family of flies (Diptera: Sarcophagidae). This reference suggests that the location may be associated with entomological studies, biodiversity documentation, or ecological research related to these insects. The inclusion of Zhaojue in such a key highlights its relevance as a geographical identifier for classifying or studying Sarcophagini species, potentially due to its unique environmental conditions or documented presence of specific taxa.  \n\nThe entity \"\"Zhaojue\"\" thus represents both a political-administrative unit in Sichuan and a geographical marker in specialized scientific contexts. While the descriptions initially appear contradictory by labeling it as both a city and a county, this is resolved by understanding China’s administrative hierarchy, where county-level cities are a recognized category. Its mention in the Sarcophagini taxonomic key underscores its utility in academic and biological frameworks, adding a layer of scientific importance to its regional profile.  \n\nZhaojue’s role as a county-level city implies it serves as a hub for local governance, economic activities, and cultural preservation within Sichuan. The province itself is known for its diverse landscapes, historical heritage, and ecological significance, which may contribute to Zhaojue’s relevance in both administrative and scientific domains. However, the provided data does not elaborate on its population, history, or other socio-economic details, focusing instead on its dual classification and entomological association.  \n\nIn summary, Zhaojue is a county-level city in Sichuan Province, China, recognized in both administrative and scientific contexts. Its inclusion in the Sarcophagini taxonomic key emphasizes its role in biological classification, while its status as a county-level city reflects its position within China’s administrative structure. The entity’s description reconciles the apparent contradiction by clarifying the terminology used in Chinese governance and highlighting its interdisciplinary relevance.\",1\n5915,SUPPLEMENTUM ENT.SYST.,\"Journal where species like Cuphocera varia, Jurinia angustiventris, and Cyphocera pyrrogaster were documented\",20\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9205,GUO'S EUCHARID FLY,FAN,Fan is the author who described Heteronychia quoi in 1964,301\n10114,兴隆亚麻蝇,FAN,FAN于1964年首次描述了兴隆亚麻蝇,301\n10120,云南亚麻蝇,FAN,FAN于1964年首次描述了云南亚麻蝇,301\n9201,HETERONYCHIA QUOI,FAN,Fan is the describer of the species Heteronychia quoi,300\n1884,上海九点花蝇ENNEASTIGMA SHANGHAIENSIS FAN ET CHEN,FAN,Fan is the primary describer of the Enneastigma shanghaiensis species,299\n2141,FAN,EUTRICHOTA GIGAS,Fan described the species Eutrichota gigas in 1988,298\n7657,CHRY SOMYA (COMPSOMYIA) PINGUIS,LIAONING,\"The species *Chrysomya (Compsomyia) pinguis* is distributed in Liaoning, China\",251\n10058,PARASARCOPHAGA BREVICORNIS,LIAONING,Species distributed in Liaoning,241\n11560,REVUE RUSSE ENT.,LIAONING,The Revue Russe Ent. documents species found in Liaoning,232\n9306,LIAONING,PHALLOSPHAERA AMICA,Phallosphaera amica is distributed in Liaoning,227\n9748,BERCAEA CRUENTATA,INNER MONGOLIA,\"\n\n**BERCAEA CRUENTATA** is a species native to the **INNER MONGOLIA** region, where it is specifically distributed.
