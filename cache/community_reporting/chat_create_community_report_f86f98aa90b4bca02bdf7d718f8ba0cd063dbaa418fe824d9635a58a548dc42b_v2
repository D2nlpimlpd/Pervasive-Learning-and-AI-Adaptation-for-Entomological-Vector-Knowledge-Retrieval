Additionally, *Phaonia luteovittata* is connected to Mudanjiang, suggesting the city's ecological or geographical relevance to this species. A third association with *Phaonia mimopalpata* further underscores Mudanjiang's role as a site of entomological interest, where these specific fly species have been observed or recorded. While the descriptions do not elaborate on the nature of these associations (e.g., habitat, research, or biodiversity significance), they collectively highlight Mudanjiang as a location with documented ties to three distinct *Phaonia* species. The city’s placement in Heilongjiang Province, a region known for its cold temperate climate and diverse ecosystems, may contribute to the presence of these species, though further details on their ecological roles or interactions in the area are not provided. The repeated mention of *Phaonia* species in the context of Mudanjiang implies that the city could be a focal point for studies on these insects, potentially related to their distribution, behavior, or conservation in northeastern China.
