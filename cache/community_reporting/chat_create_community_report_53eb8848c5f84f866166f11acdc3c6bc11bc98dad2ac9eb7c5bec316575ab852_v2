It is officially titled *动物分类学报* in Chinese and is commonly referenced in English as either *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica* or *Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy*. The journal has served as a platform for studies on insect classification, including detailed work on species such as *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Shakshainia rametoka*, and *Helina calceatricula*. Notably, it has also been cited in the formal description of *Iranihindia spinosa*, which was documented in 1985.  \n\nResearch published in the journal spans both regional and global entomological contributions. For instance, Gao Jingming and collaborators have utilized the journal to advance blowfly classification, a critical area in forensic entomology and ecological studies. The journal’s scope is further illustrated by its inclusion of taxonomic analyses on diverse insect groups, reflecting its role in documenting biodiversity and systematic research.  \n\nThe journal’s dual English names—*Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica* and *Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy*—likely stem from historical or translational variations, but both refer to the same publication under the Chinese title *动物分类学报*. This ambiguity is resolved by emphasizing the Chinese name as the primary identifier, with the English titles noted as alternative references. The journal’s prominence in the field is underscored by its long-standing tradition of publishing foundational taxonomic work, such as the 1985 description of *Iranihindia spinosa*, which highlights its role in formalizing new species discoveries.  \n\nIn summary, the *动物分类学报* (Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica / Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy) is a key Chinese journal in animal taxonomy, particularly entomology, with a history of publishing significant studies on insect classification by researchers like Gao Jingming. It has documented species such as *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Shakshainia rametoka*, *Helina calceatricula*, and *Iranihindia spinosa*, the latter of which was formally described in 1985. The journal bridges regional and international taxonomic research, offering a platform for both Chinese and global scientific communities to contribute to the understanding of animal biodiversity. Its dual English titles reflect its multilingual accessibility, though the Chinese name remains its definitive identifier. The journal’s contributions to blowfly classification and other insect groups demonstrate its importance in advancing systematic entomology and related disciplines.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",19\n1379,ENTOMOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF CHINA,\"\n\nThe *Entomological Journal of China* is an academic publication dedicated to advancing the study of insect biology, taxonomy, and ecology. It serves as a platform for researchers to disseminate findings on diverse insect species, including both original research and taxonomic descriptions. The journal has featured studies on the species *Servillia planiforceps* and *Tachina nupta*, contributing to the understanding of their morphology, behavior, and ecological roles. Additionally, it has published detailed descriptions of new or previously undocumented species within the genus *Alliopsis*, such as *Alliopsis gigantosternita*, *Alliopsis curvifemoralis*, and *Alliopsis hemiliostylata*. These contributions highlight the journal’s focus on documenting biodiversity and supporting entomological science through rigorous, peer-reviewed research. By addressing both specific case studies and broader taxonomic classifications, the *Entomological Journal of China* plays a key role in expanding knowledge of insect fauna, particularly in the region of China, while also fostering international collaboration in the field. Its scope encompasses a wide range of entomological disciplines, ensuring a comprehensive resource for scientists and conservationists.\",12\n1387,\"GEDANG, MEDEOG\",\"Location in Tibet, China, serving as the type locality for Alliopsis curvifemoralis, Alliopsis hemiliostylata, Alliopsis rectiforceps, Alliopsis heterophalla, and Alliopsis problella\",4\n3408,QINLING,\"\n\n**QINLING** is a mountain range located in **Shaanxi Province, China**, and is recognized as the **type locality for the species *Phaonia vulpinus***. The descriptions provided highlight its geographical and biological significance, though one mentions **Shanxi Province** instead of Shaanxi, likely a typographical error. The Qinling Mountains are a major natural feature in central China, forming a boundary between the northern and southern regions of the country. They are ecologically and culturally important, supporting diverse ecosystems and serving as a critical habitat for various species, including *Phaonia vulpinus*, a fly species first documented in this area. The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the specific geographic location where a species is first identified and described, making the Qinling Mountains a key reference site for taxonomic studies of *Phaonia vulpinus*. While one description incorrectly associates Qinling with Shanxi, the majority of sources and scientific consensus align with its established location in Shaanxi. This clarification ensures accuracy in understanding the region's role in biodiversity research. The Qinling Mountains are also notable for their historical and environmental importance, acting as a traditional divide between China's northern and southern climates and ecosystems. Their inclusion in the context of *Phaonia vulpinus* underscores the area's value in entomological studies. In summary, **QINLING** is a mountain range in **Shaanxi, China**, renowned for its ecological diversity and as the type locality for *Phaonia vulpinus*, with the conflicting reference to Shanxi resolved in favor of the widely accepted Shaanxi location.\",2\n3413,PHAOINIA VULPINUS,\"Fly species described in 1988 by Wu, Fang, and Fan with type locality in Qinling, Shaanxi\",6\n1369,WUDU LIANGSHUI,\"\n\n**WUDU LIANGSHUI** is a location in **Gansu Province, China**, recognized as the **type locality** for the species *Alliopsis gigantosternita*. A type locality refers to the specific geographic site where a species is first discovered, documented, and formally described in scientific literature, serving as a critical reference for its taxonomic classification. The descriptions provided consistently identify WUDU LIANGSHUI as the site associated with *Alliopsis gigantosternita* in Gansu, emphasizing its role in the species' nomenclatural history. While no additional ecological or geological details about the location are included in the given data, its designation as a type locality highlights its significance in the study of biodiversity and paleontology within the region. The lack of contradictory information allows for a unified summary, confirming WUDU LIANGSHUI’s importance as the foundational site for this species’ scientific identification.\",1\n3409,J. MED.
