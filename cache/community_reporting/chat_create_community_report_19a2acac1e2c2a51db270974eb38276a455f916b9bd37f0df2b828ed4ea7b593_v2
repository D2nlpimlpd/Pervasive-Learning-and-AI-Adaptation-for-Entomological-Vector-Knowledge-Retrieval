It is home to several notable species, including *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*, *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, and *Nupedia aestiva*, with the latter two being explicitly noted as having foreign distribution records in Nepal. The country also hosts *Sarcophaga haematodes*, *LUTEIVENTRIS DICHAETOMYIA*, and *Himalayan Spring Fly* (type locality), underscoring its role in the taxonomy and ecology of these insects. Additionally, *Neomyia fletcheri* (a greenbottle fly) and *Neomyia* species are documented in Nepal, alongside *Paradichosia scutellata*, which is collected in moist evergreen oak forests.  \n\nNepal’s fly fauna includes species such as *Anthomyia illocata*, *Sarcorohdendorfia mimobasalis*, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Eudasyphora cyanicolor*, *Hylemya nigrimana*, *Isomyia electa*, *Rhyncomya setipyga*, *Sturmiopsis inferens*, and *Tuye Pseudomyopina fumidorsis probola*. The genus *Lasiopelta* and *Linnaemya* are also reported to be distributed there. Specific localities within Nepal, such as the South end of Lake Baikal (likely a misstatement, as Lake Baikal is in Russia) and Bangel Kharka, are highlighted as first-discovery sites for *Phorbia perssoni* and *Phorbia tysoni*, respectively. *Polietes orientalis* adults have been collected on *Rhododendron* at 3,400 meters, indicating high-altitude adaptations.  \n\nThe country is linked to the distribution of *Adia danieli* (type locality) and the genus *Adia*, as well as *Scathophaga mellipes* and *Calythea setifrons* as international or foreign regions. *Metalliopsis setosa* and *Musca bezzii* are reported in Nepal, while *Musca crassirostris* is noted for its foreign distribution records. Chinese-named species like 戟斗细麻蝇 (a specific fly species) and 紫翠蝇, 绿翠蝇 (purple and green blowflies) are also found there, alongside 毛瓣家蝇 (a foreign distribution area for this species).  \n\nNepal’s role in entomological studies is further emphasized by its inclusion in taxonomic keys for Sarcophagini and as a distribution site for *Chlororhinia exempta* and *Insecta lapponica*. The genus *Sinonipponia* is documented in the region, and the species 1397卡西亚麻蝇 (likely a misrendered or localized name) is associated with Nepal. These records collectively illustrate Nepal’s ecological diversity and its importance as a habitat for both native and internationally distributed fly species, spanning lowland to high-altitude environments.
