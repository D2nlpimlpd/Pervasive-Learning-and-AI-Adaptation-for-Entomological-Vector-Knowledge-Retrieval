This species, a member of the genus *Fannia* (commonly known as lesser house flies or latrine flies), is also referred to in Chinese as **刷股厕蝇** (*shuā gǔ cè yíng*), a term that translates to \"\"brush-legged latrine fly.\"\" The descriptions provided consistently attribute the taxonomic work on *Fannia kowarzi* to Verrall, confirming his role in both naming and scientifically defining the species during the late 19th century. While the Chinese name 刷股厕蝇 is associated with the same species, it is not explicitly stated whether Verrall directly contributed to the Chinese nomenclature or if this is a later translation by entomologists in China. The entity \"\"VERRALL\"\" appears to refer to a single individual, likely a taxonomist or entomologist, whose work in 1892 established the foundational classification of *Fannia kowarzi*. No contradictions exist in the data regarding the species or the year of description, and the summary integrates all provided information into a unified account of Verrall's contributions.\",3\n1632,XIFENG,\"\n\nXIFENG is a city located in the Liaoning Province of China. It is recognized as a significant geographical site associated with the distribution of the species *Fannia kowarzi*, a type of fly, and as a recorded location for the presence of *Coenosia strigipes*, another fly species. These associations highlight Xifeng's role in entomological studies, particularly in documenting the habitats and ranges of such species within the region. The city is further described as a general location in Liaoning where \"\"the species is recorded,\"\" though this phrasing is less specific and likely refers to the two named species mentioned in the other descriptions. Collectively, the data underscores Xifeng's ecological relevance as a site where both *Fannia kowarzi* and *Coenosia strigipes* have been observed or documented, contributing to regional biodiversity records. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as all consistently identify Xifeng as a location in Liaoning, China, with ties to these species.\",3\n1636,ENT. MON. MAG.,\"\n\n**ENT. MON. MAG.** (likely an abbreviation for *Entomological Monthly Magazine* or a similar entomology-focused publication) is a scientific journal or periodical associated with the description of two distinct species within the field of entomology. The publication is noted for documenting *Fannia kowarzi*, a species of fly, and *Hydrotaea pandellei*, another fly species, which was specifically described in **volume 23, page 250** of the journal. These entries highlight the publication’s role in taxonomic research, serving as a platform for entomologists to formally introduce and classify new or notable insect species. While the exact scope or historical context of ENT. MON. MAG. is not detailed in the provided descriptions, its connection to these two species underscores its relevance in the study of dipteran taxonomy. The journal’s format, as suggested by the entity name, may involve monthly releases, aligning with its potential function as a regular academic resource for entomological discoveries. Both *Fannia kowarzi* and *Hydrotaea pandellei* are likely part of broader taxonomic works published in the journal, contributing to the understanding of fly biodiversity and classification. The specific reference to volume 23, page 250 for *Hydrotaea pandellei* indicates that ENT. MON. MAG. employs a structured pagination system, typical of scientific publications, to organize and reference its content. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they both point to the same entity and its role in entomological literature. The summary consolidates the information to reflect ENT. MON.
