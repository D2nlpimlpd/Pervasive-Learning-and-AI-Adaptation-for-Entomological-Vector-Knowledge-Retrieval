Described by Suwa in 1974\",5\n1096,INS. MATSUM.,\"\n\n**INS. MATSUM.** is a publication associated with the description of the species *Pegomya japonica*, commonly known as the Japanese Pegomya fly. The entity is specifically referenced in the context of entomological research, where it served as a source for documenting the taxonomic details of this fly species. One of the key pieces of information provided is that *Pegomya japonica* was described in 1974 within the pages of **Ins. Matsum.**, which likely refers to a journal or scientific work published by or under the auspices of the Matsumoto Institute, a research entity historically linked to studies in insect taxonomy. The Chinese name for the species, 亚山花蝇 (*Yàshān huāyíng*), is also cited in the same publication, confirming its role in bridging scientific and regional nomenclature. While the descriptions do not explicitly detail the content or scope of **Ins. Matsum.** beyond its connection to *Pegomya japonica*, the publication is recognized as a scholarly reference for this species, contributing to its formal classification in 1974. The entity’s significance lies in its contribution to the entomological record, particularly in documenting the Japanese Pegomya fly, which is part of the broader *Pegomya* genus within the family *Syrphidae* (hoverflies). The lack of additional details about the publication’s other works or authors suggests that its primary relevance here is its role in the 1974 taxonomic description of *Pegomya japonica*. The use of both the scientific and Chinese names in the descriptions highlights the publication’s utility in cross-referencing international and local taxonomic literature. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they both align on the publication’s role in describing the species and the year of publication. **Ins. Matsum.** remains a notable source for this specific taxonomic entry, underscoring its importance in the field of dipteran entomology.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2353,PEGOMYA JAPONICA,SUWA,Suwa described Pegomya japonica in 1974,40\n1492,INS.
