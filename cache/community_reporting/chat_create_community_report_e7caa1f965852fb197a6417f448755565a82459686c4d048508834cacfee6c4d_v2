It is associated with the distribution of *Onesia wolongensis*, a species of flowering plant, and is also linked to *Dexopollenia maculata*, a beetle species. These associations underscore WOLONG’s role as a habitat for diverse and potentially endemic organisms. The area is part of Sichuan’s broader biodiversity-rich landscape, which includes mountainous ecosystems supporting unique flora and fauna. While the first description specifies Balang Mountain as the precise location for *Onesia wolongensis*, the second description generalizes WOLONG as a Sichuan location tied to *Dexopollenia maculata*. This suggests that WOLONG may encompass multiple ecological zones or microhabitats within Sichuan, contributing to the presence of distinct species. The lack of direct contradiction between the two descriptions allows for a unified summary emphasizing WOLONG’s connection to both species, with the clarification that *Onesia wolongensis* is explicitly tied to Balang Mountain.
