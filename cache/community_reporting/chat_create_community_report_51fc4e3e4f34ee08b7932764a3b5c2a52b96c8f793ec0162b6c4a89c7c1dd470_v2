It is characterized by its long antennae, which are noted as black in some sources, and abdominal markings, including yellow abdominal segments. The species has a body length of 4.5–5.5 mm. Its distribution spans multiple regions: it is found in **Xinjiang, China**, as well as **Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan, and other international locations**. The discrepancy in the description year (1902 vs. 1918) may reflect a later revision or clarification of the species by Stein, though the 1902 date is explicitly tied to its initial description. The abdominal features are described as \"\"markings\"\" in one account and \"\"yellow segments\"\" in another, suggesting that the yellow coloration is a key part of the abdominal pattern. Illustrations of the species were provided by Hennig in 1952, aiding in its taxonomic identification. Despite variations in the details across sources, the core attributes of long antennae, yellow abdominal segments, and a geographic range encompassing East and Southeast Asia remain consistent.

PETERSB.,\"\n\nThe *Annals of the Zoological Museum of Petersburg* (abbreviated as **ANN. MUS. ZOOL. PETERSB**) is a scientific journal associated with the Zoological Museum of Petersburg, serving as a publication platform for taxonomic and entomological research. It has documented the descriptions of multiple species, including **Pegomya aniseta**, which was described in 1907 by the entomologist Stein. Similarly, **Sinochirosia variegata** was originally described in the same journal by Stein in 1907, highlighting its role in early 20th-century dipteran taxonomy. The journal also features **Delia angustissima**, a species documented within its pages, though the specific year or author for this entry is not provided in the data. Additionally, it has published the description of **瘦叶近脉花蝇** (a species name in Chinese, likely referring to a specific fly species, though the English translation is not included in the data). \n\nThe journal’s contributions span diverse taxa, with a focus on dipterous insects (flies), as evidenced by the inclusion of species from genera such as *Pegomya*, *Sinochirosia*, and *Delia*. Stein’s work in 1907 is particularly notable, as he described both *Pegomya aniseta* and *Sinochirosia variegata* in the journal, underscoring its historical significance in entomological studies. While the data does not specify the exact years for all species (e.g., *Delia angustissima* and *瘦叶近脉花蝇*), it confirms the journal’s role as a repository for zoological discoveries, particularly in the field of insect classification. The full name of the journal, *Annals of the Zoological Museum of Petersburg*, aligns with its function as a formal scientific record, likely reflecting the museum’s research output. \n\nThe entity **ANN. MUS. ZOOL. PETERSB** is thus a key reference for taxonomic work, especially for species described in the early 1900s. Its documentation of *Pegomya aniseta* and *Sinochirosia variegata* by Stein in 1907, along with other species like *Delia angustissima* and *瘦叶近脉花蝇*, establishes it as a foundational publication in zoology. The journal’s focus on museum-based research and its historical role in describing new species make it a critical resource for understanding the biodiversity and classification of insects, particularly in regions connected to the Zoological Museum of Petersburg. Contradictions in the data (e.g., variations in the journal’s name as \"\"Annals\"\" vs. \"\"Annual\"\") are resolved by treating them as alternative references to the same publication, emphasizing its consistent use in scientific literature. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",3\n312,HENNIG,,65\n299,DIPTERA,\"\n\n**Diptera** is the order of insects commonly known as flies, encompassing all true flies and characterized by their possession of a single pair of functional wings (the hind wings are modified into halteres for balance). This taxonomic group is a fundamental classification in entomology, with species exhibiting a wide range of ecological roles, including pollination, decomposition, and parasitism. The order is further divided into suborders, with one notable classification system proposed by Steyskal, who grouped Diptera into **Tipulata** and **Psychodata**. However, this classification is less commonly referenced in modern taxonomy, where Diptera is typically split into suborders such as **Nematocera** (e.g., mosquitoes, crane flies) and **Brachycera** (e.g., houseflies, fruit flies), based on morphological and developmental traits.  \n\nA specific example of a species within Diptera is **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) idmais**, which has been documented in the journal *Encycl.Ent.* This species highlights the diversity of the order, as it belongs to the family Sarcophagidae (flesh flies), a subgroup of Brachycera. The inclusion of such species underscores the broad phylogenetic and ecological scope of Diptera, which includes both free-living and parasitic forms.  \n\nWhile Steyskal’s division into Tipulata and Psychodata reflects historical taxonomic approaches, contemporary classifications often prioritize evolutionary relationships and genetic data. Despite these variations in suborder categorization, all descriptions agree that Diptera is a monophyletic group, meaning its members share a common ancestor. The order is distinguished by unique features such as a single pair of wings, a well-developed halter, and a wide range of larval habitats, from aquatic environments to terrestrial detritus.  \n\nIn summary, **Diptera** represents a critical and diverse insect order, with species like *Parasarcophaga idmais* illustrating its ecological and taxonomic complexity. The classification into suborders remains a topic of debate, with Steyskal’s Tipulata and Psychodata serving as one framework among others, while the broader significance of Diptera in ecosystems and human contexts (e.g., disease transmission, forensic entomology) remains undisputed.\",8\n2215,肖秋家蝇,肖秋家蝇 (Musca amita Hennig) 是一种蝇类，其♂个体侧颜在触角第二节水平的宽度大于或等于第三节，第五背板被覆灰黄色粉被且无明显暗色条。体长4.5-6.7毫米。分布于中国黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、内蒙古、河北、北京、山西、宁夏、青海、新疆、山东，以及苏联（模式产地）和蒙古。,7\n3214,HELINA NUDIFEMORATA,,6\n1423,帕米尔叉泉蝇,\"Eutrichota pamirensis is a species of fly described by Hennig in 1972.

As a geographical entity, FENGSHAN serves as a reference point for biodiversity studies in southern Taiwan, highlighting its role in supporting local wildlife. The district’s environment, characterized by its subtropical climate and diverse habitats, likely contributes to the presence and study of such species. While the first description broadly notes FENGSHAN as a location in Taiwan linked to a species, the second provides a more specific identification of *Helina lateralis* in Kaohsiung, confirming the district’s relevance to entomological research. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as both align in identifying FENGSHAN as a site of biological interest within Kaohsiung.

In 1947, he expanded his taxonomic work by describing additional *Dasyphora* species, including *Dasyphora trichosterna*. By 1951, ZIMIN’s expertise was evident in multiple publications: he described *Mesembrina montana* and *Mesembrina gracilior*, established the subgenus *Pyrelliomima*, and contributed to the description of *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca vitripennis*, *Musca osiris*, *Orthellia pacifica*, and *Neomyia laevifrons*. That same year, he also played a role in the ecological description of *Musca crassirostris* and was cited for illustrations of *Musca domestica* and *Graphomya maculata* (Figure 678). In 1954, ZIMIN described *Linnaemya zachvatkini* and *Pyrellia secunda* (双毛碧蝇), further solidifying his work on *Dasyphora* and related genera. Earlier, in 1929, he described *Servillia ardens*, and later in 1967 and 1980, he contributed to the taxonomy of *Tachina nigriventris* and *Tachina turanica*, respectively. Additionally, ZIMIN described *Schineria setinervis* in 1974 and *Musca amica* in 1954, the latter being a synonym for *Musca vitripennis*. His research also included the establishment of the subgenus *Dasysterna* in 1951. ZIMIN’s work was frequently referenced in illustrations and descriptions of other species, such as *Stomoxys calcitrans* and *Graphomya maculata*, highlighting his influence on visual and textual documentation in entomology. Despite the breadth of his contributions, the data does not clarify whether ZIMIN worked in a specific institution or region beyond his Chinese nationality. His career appears to have focused on both morphological taxonomy and ecological insights, with a particular emphasis on muscid and tachinid flies. The repeated mentions of 1951 as a pivotal year suggest it was a period of intense activity, during which he described multiple species, subgenera, and contributed to illustrations. ZIMIN’s legacy includes resolving taxonomic complexities, such as synonymizing *Musca amica* with *Musca vitripennis*, and advancing the understanding of fly biodiversity through meticulous descriptions and ecological observations. His work remains a foundational reference in the study of these insect groups.\",24\n1985,MESAMBRIANA RESPLENDENS,A species of Mesembrina with subspecies and distribution details provided in the text,6\n2276,DASYPHORA ASIATICA,\"A species of fly with a 3-3.5x wider third antennal segment in males and a metallic green body with dense white powder, distributed in Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, Shanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai (China)\",5\n1570,肖瘤胫厕蝇,\"肖瘤胫厕蝇 (Fannia subscalaris Zimin, 1945) is a species of fly described by Zimin in 1945, characterized by specific morphological features such as the absence of a blunt-headed bristle cluster on the mid-femur and a low tubercle on the mid-tibia.

In the most widely accepted modern classification, Muscomorpha is recognized as an **infraorder** within the **suborder Brachycera**, which is itself part of the larger Brachycera lineage. This infraorder is often considered equivalent to the **superfamily Calyptratae**, a grouping that includes flies with a distinctive calypter (a lobe covering the halteres) and a diverse array of species such as houseflies, fruit flies, and blowflies. The Calyptratae superfamily is characterized by a range of ecological and morphological adaptations, including a shortened pupal stage and a tendency toward more advanced developmental traits compared to other brachyceran groups.  \n\nHowever, some descriptions present conflicting placements. One source refers to Muscomorpha as a **suborder** equivalent to the broader Brachycera suborder, which may reflect an older or alternative taxonomic framework where the distinction between suborders and infraorders is less rigid. Another description positions Muscomorpha as a **superfamily within the suborder Bibionomorpha**, a group that includes non-brachyceran flies like crane flies and march flies. This latter classification is likely incorrect, as Bibionomorpha and Brachycera are traditionally separate suborders, with Muscomorpha firmly associated with Brachycera. The mention of \"\"Psychodata\"\" in the second description appears to be a typographical or terminological error, as this term is not recognized in standard dipteran taxonomy.  \n\nA key morphological feature distinguishing Muscomorpha (or Calyptratae) is the **absence of spiracles on the 6th and 7th abdominal tergites in females**, a trait observed in many species within this group. This characteristic is critical for identification and reflects evolutionary adaptations in respiratory structures. Additionally, members of Muscomorpha are typically associated with terrestrial habitats and exhibit a wide range of behaviors, from parasitism to scavenging, with many playing significant roles in decomposition, pollination, and disease transmission.  \n\nIn summary, **Muscomorpha is best classified as an infraorder within the Brachycera suborder of Diptera**, equivalent to the Calyptratae superfamily. It is distinguished by the absence of female abdominal spiracles and includes ecologically and morphologically diverse flies. Earlier or alternative classifications that equate it to a suborder or place it within Bibionomorpha are outdated or erroneous, as current phylogenetic studies support its position within Brachycera. The confusion with \"\"Psychodata\"\" likely stems from a misnomer or misinterpretation of Brachycera's subdivisions. This group remains a focal point in entomological research due to its economic and ecological importance.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",9\n322,MUSCIDA,\"\n\n**MUSCIDA** (commonly referred to as *Muscidae* in scientific taxonomy) is a family of flies within the superfamily **Muscoidea**, known for including ecologically and economically significant species such as the common house fly (*Musca domestica*). The family is characterized by distinct morphological traits, particularly in the structure of their **ovipositors** and **wing venation**, which aid in their classification and differentiation from other fly families. \n\n*Muscidae* encompasses several subfamilies, including **Fanniinae**, **Phaoniinae**, **Mydaeinae**, **Coenosiinae**, and **Atherigoninae**, each contributing to the family’s diversity. Genera within this family include **Atherigona**, **Lispe**, and **Musca**, with species like the house fly being widely recognized for their role in disease transmission and nuisance to humans and animals. The family’s taxonomic structure is further highlighted by its inclusion in broader classifications, such as the superfamily Muscoidea, which groups related fly families with similar biological traits. \n\nNotably, *Muscidae* is also referenced in the description of the species **Myospila bina**, underscoring its relevance in entomological studies. While some sources use the term \"\"Muscida\"\" to denote the family, the accepted scientific name is *Muscidae*. The family’s ecological roles vary, with members inhabiting diverse environments and exhibiting behaviors such as scavenging, parasitism, or predation, depending on the subfamily and species. \n\nIn summary, *Muscidae* (MUSCIDA) is a well-defined family of flies distinguished by unique anatomical features and a broad range of subfamilies and genera. It includes both the ubiquitous house fly and lesser-known species like *Myospila bina*, reflecting its importance in both applied and academic contexts. The family’s classification under Muscoidea and its morphological adaptations, such as specialized ovipositors and wing structures, provide key insights into its evolutionary and ecological significance.\",8\n1551,PHAONIINA,\"\n\n**PHAONIINA** is a subfamily of flies (Phaoniinae) within the family Muscidae, characterized by distinct morphological traits and a diverse range of genera. It includes the genera *Rhynchomydaea*, *Brontaea*, *Dichaetomyia*, and *Helina*, which are grouped under this taxonomic classification. The subfamily is distinguished by specific anatomical features, such as the presence of three abdominal notopleural bristles arranged in an equilateral triangle, a broad ovipositor in females, and unique wing and antennal structures. These traits help differentiate Phaoniinae from other subfamilies within the Muscidae family. While the first description emphasizes the inclusion of particular genera, the second highlights the subfamily’s taxonomic placement and defining characteristics. Together, they establish Phaoniina as a well-defined group within the broader context of fly taxonomy, with both phylogenetic and morphological significance. The summary integrates all provided details without contradiction, ensuring a cohesive overview of the entity.\",9\n1555,PHAONIA,\"\n\n**Phaonia** is a genus of flies belonging to the subfamily Phaoniinae within the family Muscidae. It is characterized by distinct morphological features that aid in its taxonomic differentiation, including a **Phaonia-type lower surstylus** and the presence of a **proximal anterior bristle on the mesepisternum**. These traits are critical for distinguishing *Phaonia* from closely related genera, such as *Limnophora*, which is also discussed in comparative studies. The genus is often referenced in entomological literature alongside *Limnophora* to highlight variations in anatomical structures, particularly those related to the male terminalia and thoracic bristle patterns. *Phaonia* species are typically associated with ecological niches involving decomposition or detritus, as is common among many muscid flies. The subfamily Phaoniinae, to which *Phaonia* belongs, is part of the larger family Muscidae, which includes a diverse array of flies with significant roles in forensic science, ecology, and agriculture. While the provided descriptions do not explicitly detail the specific differences between *Phaonia* and *Limnophora*, the emphasis on the lower surstylus and mesepisternal bristle suggests these are key diagnostic markers in their classification. Further studies comparing these genera may explore additional morphological or genetic distinctions to refine their taxonomic placement. Overall, *Phaonia* serves as an important example of the taxonomic complexity within the Phaoniinae subfamily, with its unique features contributing to the broader understanding of muscid fly evolution and systematics.\",8\n321,SARCOPHAGOIDEA,\"\n\nSarcophagoidea is a superfamily of flies within the Calyptratae subsection of the Brachycera infraorder, primarily characterized by the presence of a well-developed postscutellum, a triangular sclerite on the thorax. This taxonomic group includes the family Sarcophagidae, commonly known as flesh flies, which are notable for their larvae that exhibit specific feeding habits, such as consuming decaying flesh, animal waste, or other organic matter. The superfamily is referenced in figures A37-A39 and A42, drawing from the works of van Emden (1954) and Rohdendorf (1930–1935), who described its morphological and ecological traits. Sarcophagoidea plays a significant role in forensic entomology due to the carrion-feeding behavior of its larvae, which aids in decomposition processes and can provide insights into postmortem intervals. The inclusion of flesh flies within this superfamily highlights its ecological and taxonomic importance in the study of Diptera.\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3358,MESAMBRIANA MONTANA ASTERNOPOURALIS,FAN,Fan described the subspecies Mesembrina montana asternopleuralis in 1965,298\n1378,LEUCOPHORA GRISELLA,HEILONGJIANG,Leucophora grisella is distributed in Heilongjiang,202\n2896,HEILONGJIANG,HYDROTAEA SPINIGERA,\"Hydrotaea spinigera is found in Heilongjiang, China\",199\n5161,PYGOPHORA LONGICORNIS,STEIN,Stein described Pygophora longicornis in 1902,129\n480,STEIN,ANN.
