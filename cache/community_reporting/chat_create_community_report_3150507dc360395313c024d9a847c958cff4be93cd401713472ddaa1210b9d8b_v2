The country is part of the distribution range for the species *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni*, a fly belonging to the family Sarcophagidae, and *Egle anthomyioides*, a parasitoid wasp in the family Pteromalidae. Additionally, Bulgaria supports the presence of the genus *Sinonipponia*, which is associated with the family Sesiidae (clearwing moths), and the species *Haematobia titillans*, commonly known as the horn fly, a significant pest in livestock management. The genus *Helicophagella*, part of the family Helicophagidae (a group of parasitic flies), is also documented as occurring in Bulgaria. These entities collectively underscore Bulgaria’s ecological diversity, particularly in its entomological fauna, and highlight the country’s role in the broader biogeographical context of Europe. The inclusion of both specific species and genera in these descriptions reflects the varied taxonomic levels represented in Bulgaria’s natural habitats, emphasizing its importance as a region for biodiversity studies and conservation efforts.\",2\n639,HAMBURG,Hamburg is a city in Germany specified as the type locality for Egle muscaria,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n624,INNER MONGOLIA,EGLE MUSCARIA,Egle muscaria is distributed in Inner Mongolia,169\n646,EGLE CONCOMITANS,BEIJING,Egle concomitans is distributed in Beijing,106\n1868,板须原泉蝇,PANDELLE,Pandelle described the species Nupedia patellans in 1900,18\n642,REV.
