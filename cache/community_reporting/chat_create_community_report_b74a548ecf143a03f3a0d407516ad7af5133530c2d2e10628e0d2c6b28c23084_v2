Active from at least 1916 to 1948, Seguy is best known for his work on flies, including the establishment of the genus *Pollenomyia* in 1935 and the description of its type species. He described multiple species across different genera and families, such as *Meliniella griseifrons* (1923), *Delia echinata* (1923), *Eustalomyia lepraota* (1928), and the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly (1928). In 1932, he authored *Gymnodia spilogaster*, later recognized as a synonym of *Brontaea tonitrui*. His 1934 publications include *Isomyia oestracea* in *Encycl. Ent.*, *Bellardia menechma*, and *Lucilia (Luciliella) bazini*. Additionally, he described *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) koulingiana* in 1941 and *Calliphora axata* in 1946, the latter of which is a species of blowfly. Seguy also contributed to the taxonomy of *Limnophora*, authoring *Limnophora pandellei* (1946), a synonym for *Limnophora orbitalis*. Notably, he described *Caiusa coomani* in 1948, a species later referred to as the Vietnam jewel fly, and *Isomyia isomyia* in 1946, further expanding his work on the *Isomyia* genus. His 1916 description of *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) chini* and 1935 work on *Nystomyia* in *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.* highlight his long-standing engagement with fly taxonomy. Seguy’s research was cited in studies related to Laos in 1946 and referenced in the description of the Scathophagidae family (粪蝇科) in figure A40. His career spanned both foundational taxonomic work and the establishment of new genera, reflecting a broad expertise in entomology. Despite some species being later synonymized or reclassified, his contributions remain critical to the understanding of dipteran biodiversity, particularly in Southeast Asia.

The journal is notable for its contributions to entomology and natural history, particularly in documenting new taxa. It served as the publication venue for the description of the genus *Hypopygiopsis*, a taxonomic group within the field of natural history. Additionally, *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.* was instrumental in the formal description of the genus *Xenotachina* and its related species, further expanding the understanding of insect biodiversity. The journal also published key works on the *Myospila* genus, including the 1922 description of *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* by Malloch, as well as the earlier documentation of *Myospila femorata*. These contributions highlight the journal’s role in advancing taxonomic research during the early to mid-20th century, particularly in the study of Diptera (flies) and other arthropods. While the journal’s primary focus was on natural history, its publications on these specific genera and species demonstrate its importance as a platform for entomological discoveries.

Additionally, Kashmir serves as the type locality for *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons*, a subspecies within the genus *Myospila*. The region is further mentioned in the context of a taxonomic key for the Sarcophagini tribe, which is used to classify and identify species within this group. While the descriptions emphasize Kashmir’s role in the distribution and classification of these flies, they collectively underscore its importance as a geographical and biological reference point in entomological research.
