The genus was first described by R.-D. in 1830 and is notable for its black legs, a trait consistently observed across its species. Males of the genus exhibit specific anatomical structures, including a preapical bristle on the anterior surstylus, which is a key identifier for classification. Additionally, male Hydrophoria flies often possess long, sclerotized lateral tail lobes, further distinguishing them within the fly family. In terms of body size, individuals in this genus typically range from 4.0 to 11.0 mm in length, as noted in comparative studies. Another defining characteristic is the absence of a terminal posterior abdominal bristle on the hind tibia, a feature that differentiates Hydrophoria from related genera. These traits collectively contribute to the taxonomic identification of the genus, emphasizing its unique adaptations and structural variations. The descriptions provided align in defining Hydrophoria as a group of flies with specialized male morphology and specific leg and tail features, with no contradictory information to resolve. The genus remains a subject of entomological study due to its distinct physical attributes and ecological niche.\",3\n476,HYDROPHORIA R.-D.,Hydrophoria R.-D. is a person who described the genus Hydrophoria in 1830,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n393,HYDROPHORIA,R.-D.,R.-D. is the taxonomist who described the genus Hydrophoria,16\n391,HYDROPHORIA R.-D.,HYDROPHORIA,Hydrophoria R.-D. described the genus Hydrophoria in 1830,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
