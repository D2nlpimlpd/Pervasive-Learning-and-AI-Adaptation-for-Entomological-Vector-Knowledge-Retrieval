One of the defining features of *Coenosiina* is the presence of three abdominal notopleural bristles arranged in an equilateral triangle, a key diagnostic criterion for its classification. Additionally, males of this subfamily exhibit a non-narrow frons (forehead region), which further aids in identification. Female *Coenosiina* species are also notable for unique ovipositor traits, though the exact nature of these traits is not detailed in the provided descriptions. \n\nThe subfamily includes at least two tribes: *Lispini* and *Coenosiini*. These tribes represent distinct evolutionary lineages within *Coenosiina*, each with its own set of morphological and ecological adaptations. The inclusion of these tribes underscores the subfamily’s diversity and its role in the broader taxonomy of muscid flies. \n\nWhile the first description broadly categorizes *Coenosiina* as a subfamily of flies, the second provides more precise taxonomic and morphological context by linking it to *Muscidae* and specifying the bristle arrangement, male frons structure, and female ovipositor characteristics. These details align with standard entomological classifications, where such anatomical features are critical for differentiating subfamilies. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they complement each other by combining taxonomic hierarchy with specific diagnostic traits. \n\nIn summary, *Coenosiina* is a subfamily of the *Muscidae* family, distinguished by three abdominal notopleural bristles in an equilateral triangle, a non-narrow male frons, and unique female ovipositor morphology.
