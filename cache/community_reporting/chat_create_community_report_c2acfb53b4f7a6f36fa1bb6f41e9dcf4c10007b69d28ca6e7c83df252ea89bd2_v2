It is characterized by distinct morphological traits, particularly in males, which include the presence of **orbital bristles** and **interfrontal bristles**. These features are highlighted as key identifiers in the genus. Additionally, males of *Nupedia* are distinguished by the **absence of certain setae** (hairs or bristles) and the presence of **forked terminalia**, which further differentiates them from related genera. The genus is primarily distributed across the **Palaearctic region**, a biogeographic realm encompassing most of Eurasia and North Africa. While the descriptions provided emphasize different aspects of the genus’s morphology—such as the presence of specific bristles versus the absence of others—these traits collectively define *Nupedia* within taxonomic classifications. The combination of these features, along with its geographic range, supports the genus’s recognition as a distinct group within the fly family. The summary integrates all provided details, resolving apparent contradictions by noting that the presence of orbital and interfrontal bristles in males coexists with the absence of other setae and the forked terminalia structure.
