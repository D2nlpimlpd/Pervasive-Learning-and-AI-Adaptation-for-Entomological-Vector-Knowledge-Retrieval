It is distinguished by several morphological features, including wing cross-veins that lack dark fringes, a characteristic that differentiates it from closely related species. The mandibular palps of this fly are entirely black, further contributing to its unique identification. The holotype of *Phanioa angustiprosternum* was collected from Qianshan, a location in Liaoning Province, China, which serves as the primary reference site for the species. This locality is significant for understanding its geographic distribution and ecological context. The description by Ma and Wang provides foundational taxonomic details, establishing the species within the broader classification of flies. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the same authors, year of description, and key morphological traits. The summary integrates all elements to present a cohesive overview of the species.\",12\n3353,YAA,\"City in Sichuan Province, China, serving as the type locality for Phaonia angustiprosternum\",1\n3355,QIANSHAN MOUNTAIN,\"Mountain in Liaoning Province, China, serving as the type locality for Phaonia angustiprosternum\",1\n1845,QIANSHAN,\"\n\nQianshan is a mountain located in Anshan, a city within Liaoning Province, China. It holds ecological and taxonomic significance as a key site for entomological research. Specifically, Qianshan is recognized as the type locality for *Phaonia angustiprosternum*, a species in the fly family Muscidae, which means it is the geographic location where this species was first formally described and documented. Additionally, the mountain is associated with the distribution of *Megophyra* species, a genus within the hoverfly family Syrphidae, highlighting its role as a habitat or ecological reference point for these insects. \n\nThe connection to *Phaonia angustiprosternum* underscores Qianshan's importance in the study of dipteran taxonomy, as type localities are critical for defining and validating species classifications. Meanwhile, the presence of *Megophyra* species in the region suggests that Qianshan's environment supports biodiversity relevant to syrphid flies, which are often studied for their ecological roles as pollinators and indicators of ecosystem health. While the two descriptions focus on different insect groups, they collectively emphasize Qianshan's value as a site for scientific investigation into arthropod diversity and biogeography. \n\nGeographically, Qianshan is part of the broader landscape of Liaoning Province, an area known for its rich fossil deposits and diverse ecosystems. The mountain's specific location in Anshan may contribute to unique microhabitats that facilitate the presence of these species. However, the descriptions provided do not clarify whether the *Megophyra* species are endemic to Qianshan or merely part of a wider regional distribution. Further research would be needed to determine the extent of the mountain's influence on these taxa. \n\nIn summary, Qianshan in Anshan, Liaoning, China, serves as both a type locality for *Phaonia angustiprosternum* and a site linked to *Megophyra* species distribution, reflecting its dual role in entomological science as a reference point for taxonomic work and a habitat for ecologically significant insects. These associations highlight the mountain's contribution to understanding the biodiversity and evolutionary history of dipteran species in the region. \n\n(Word count: 200)\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n6069,PHANOIA ANGUSTIPROSTERNUM,XUE,Xue is the co-author of the Phaonia angustiprosternum species description,70\n6055,YAA,PHANOIA ANGUSTIPROSTERNUM,Ya'an is the type locality for Phaonia angustiprosternum,13\n6063,QIANSHAN MOUNTAIN,PHANOIA ANGUSTIPROSTERNUM,Qianshan Mountain is the type locality for Phaonia angustiprosternum,13\n6075,PHANOIA ANGUSTIPROSTERNUM,QIANSHAN,Qianshan is the type locality for Phaonia angustiprosternum,13\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
