Active primarily between 1856 and 1877, Rondani described numerous genera and species, many of which remain foundational in modern taxonomy. He is credited with establishing the genera *Atherigona* (1856), *Brachicoma* (1856), *Chirosia* (1856), *Stomorhina* (1861), *Vibrissina* (1861), *Polietes* (1866), *Piezura* (1866), *Macronychia* (1859), *Mesomelaena* (1859), *Bothria* (1856), *Tan huaying shu* (1856), *Qianmu huaying shu* (1856), and *Orchisia* (1877). Additionally, he played a role in the classification of parasitic flies, including the synonym *Viviania* for *Zaira*.  \n\nRondani’s work on species includes notable entries such as *Pegohylemyia spinosa* (1866), *Tachina noctuarum* and *Exorista jugoslavica*, *Hilarella stictica*, *Macquartia clausicella* (1865), *Cyphocera pyrrogaster* (1859), *Scathophaga taeniopa* (1867), *Lyperosia irritans* (1862), *Senotainia albifrons* (1859), *Metopia staegeri* (1859), *Anthomyia procellaris* and *Anthomyia imbrida* (1866), *Phorichaeta fuliginaria* (1861), *Delia bracata* (1866), *Winnertzia loewi* (1859), *Stomoxys sitiens* (1873), *Lasiomma anthomyinum* (1866), and *Schineria tergestina* (1859, with the genus *Schineria* founded in 1857). He also described the subspecies *Adia grisella asiatica* via the nominate subspecies in 1870. Among his 1859 contributions were *Gonia cinerascens*, *Phorocera grisella*, *Masicera setifacies*, and the Chinese-named species *多斑聚蜂麻蝇* (likely a misspelled or transcribed name).  \n\nRondani’s taxonomic legacy includes the original description of the genus *Hydrophoria* in 1870 and the species *Dichaetomyia luteiventris* (1873, previously cited as *LUTEIVENTRIS DICHAETOMYIA*). He further described several species within the *Prosena* genus in 1861, including *Prosena epieurea*, *Prosena luculliana*, and *Prosena sybarita*. His work on *Thricops* (1856) and *Chelisia* (1856) and *Acyglossa* (1866) genera, as well as *Macronychia griseola* (1859), underscores his focus on diverse fly families.  \n\nDespite some inconsistencies in the data—such as the conflicting year for *Chaetogena* (1956 vs. 1856, likely a typo) and the ambiguous Chinese species name—Rondani’s role as a prolific taxonomist is clear. His descriptions spanned both nominate and subspecies levels, with a particular emphasis on parasitic and predatory flies. By resolving discrepancies and synthesizing his contributions, Rondani emerges as a key figure in 19th-century entomology, whose work laid groundwork for understanding dipteran taxonomy and ecology. His legacy is preserved in the continued use of many of the genera and species he established.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",57\n1940,POLIETES,\"A genus of flies with four black longitudinal stripes on the thorax, characterized by specific morphological features such as the presence of long bristles on the hind femur and the shape of the posterior spiracle\",2\n2969,明腹重毫蝇,\"Dichaetomyia luteiventris (Rondani, 1873) is a species of fly characterized by yellow-brown abdomen and described in taxonomic literature\",2\n5414,CHETOGENA,,2\n5680,BLEPHARIPA,\"饰腹寄蝇属, described by Rondani in 1856\",2\n452,TAN HUAYING SHU,\"A genus of flies described by Rondani in 1856, with males having narrow frons\",1\n456,QIANMU HUAYING SHU,\"A genus of flies described by Rondani in 1856, with males having a narrow frons and females having a wide frons\",1\n735,ATTI SOC.
