It has served as a platform for documenting discoveries in insect biodiversity and related ecological or systematic work. Among its notable contributions, the journal published the species *Delia canalis* and *Delia felsicanalis*, which are likely within the family Anthomyiidae (flower flies), though specific details about their classification or habitats are not provided in the descriptions. Additionally, it has featured descriptions of other species, such as *Egle cyrtacra* and *Acklandia aculeatoides*, further underscoring its role in advancing knowledge of insect taxonomy. The journal is also recognized for introducing the genus *Alliopsis* in 1983, marking a significant milestone in its history. While the descriptions do not clarify whether the ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH COLLECTION is a standalone journal or part of a broader publication series, its content consistently reflects a focus on entomological science, particularly in the context of species discovery and classification. The journal’s multilingual or international scope is implied by the inclusion of species names that may originate from diverse geographic regions, though its primary association with Chinese research is emphasized. By consolidating these examples, the ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH COLLECTION appears to be a key resource for entomologists, especially those studying dipteran insects and plant-insect interactions, as evidenced by the genera and species highlighted. Its historical significance is further reinforced by the 1983 description of *Alliopsis*, which likely represents a foundational contribution to the understanding of a specific insect lineage. Overall, the journal combines regional and global relevance in entomology, bridging taxonomic research with broader ecological or agricultural implications. The descriptions provided do not contain direct contradictions, but the entity’s name and the examples of published works suggest it is a specialized, peer-reviewed journal rather than a physical collection of specimens. This clarification aligns the entity with standard academic publishing practices, where \"\"collection\"\" may refer to a compilation of research articles rather than a literal archive. The ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH COLLECTION thus functions as a scholarly outlet for entomological studies, contributing to both local and international scientific discourse through the documentation of new taxa and their biological contexts.\",5\n675,CUI ET FAN,Cui and Fan are the co-authors who described the species Acklandia aculeatoides and Acklandia curvata in 1983,2\n681,JIANCHANG HEISHAN,\"Jianchang Heishan is a location in Liaoning, China, where Acklandia curvata is distributed\",1\n669,ACKLANDIA ACULEATOIDES,,5\n676,TA HE,\"Ta He is the type locality in Heilongjiang, China, for Acklandia aculeatoides\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n670,ACKLANDIA CURVATA,LIAONING,\"Acklandia curvata is distributed in Liaoning, China\",232\n660,ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH COLLECTION,EGLE CYRTACRA,Egle cyrtacra was described in the Entomological Research Collection,9\n668,CUI ET FAN,ACKLANDIA CURVATA,Cui and Fan are the co-authors who described Acklandia curvata,9\n671,ACKLANDIA CURVATA,JIANCHANG HEISHAN,\"Acklandia curvata is found in Jianchang Heishan, Liaoning\",8\n665,ACKLANDIA ACULEATOIDES,CUI ET FAN,Cui and Fan are the co-authors who described Acklandia aculeatoides,7\n667,ACKLANDIA ACULEATOIDES,TA HE,\"Acklandia aculeatoides' type locality is Ta He, Heilongjiang\",6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
