It is part of the distribution range for *Dichaetomyia bibax*, a species noted for its ecological presence in the region. Additionally, Hubei is home to *松毛虫缅麻蝇* (likely *Myiopharos* sp. or a related species) and *盘突缅麻蝇* (possibly *Myiopharos discoidalis* or a similar name), both of which are found within the province. The province also supports the distribution of *Lucilia sinensis*, a blowfly species commonly associated with forensic and ecological studies in China. \n\nHubei is further identified as a domestic distribution location for *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa*, a parasitoid fly species, and as a habitat for *Phallocheira minor*, a species of fly whose distribution is specifically noted in Macheng, a city within Hubei. While some descriptions refer to Hubei as a \"\"Chinese province in the species' distribution\"\" without specifying the species, the cumulative data highlights its role as a biodiversity hotspot for these arthropods. The province’s varied ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, and agricultural areas, likely contribute to the presence of such a diverse array of species. \n\nThe information collectively underscores Hubei’s ecological importance in the context of entomological research, particularly for species with regional or localized distributions. The inclusion of multiple species, some with specific localities like Macheng, suggests a need for further study to map their exact habitats and interactions within the province. No contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as they all align in identifying Hubei as a key location for these species. The summary integrates all listed entities and their associated species, emphasizing the province’s role in supporting a range of arthropod life. \n\n(Word count: 198)\",6\n2690,河南,\"\n\nHenan is a province located in central China and is recognized as a significant region for the distribution of various fly species. Among the notable species found in Henan are **Dichaetomyia bibax**, a fly species within the family Calliphoridae, and **Lucilia shenyangensis**, a blowfly native to the area. The province also hosts **Protocalliphora azurea**, a species of parasitic fly, and **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa**, which is part of its domestic distribution in China. Additionally, Henan is home to two specific tachinid fly species: **松毛虫缅麻蝇** (pine caterpillar Chinese tachinid fly) and **盘突缅麻蝇** (disk-protuberance Chinese tachinid fly), both of which are documented in the region.  \n\nA more localized example is **Phallocheira minor**, a species whose distribution includes Dengfeng, a city within Henan. This highlights the province’s ecological diversity, even at the municipal level. Another species, **绯胫纹蝇** (red-legged patterned fly), is explicitly noted as one of its distribution areas, further emphasizing Henan’s role in supporting a range of fly populations.  \n\nThe data collectively underscore Henan’s importance as a biodiversity hotspot for flies, particularly those with ecological or parasitic significance. While most descriptions align in identifying the province as a key location for these species, the mention of \"\"Dengfeng\"\" in the case of *Phallocheira minor* adds a specific geographic nuance. The absence of contradictory information across the descriptions allows for a unified summary, confirming Henan’s status as a central hub for the distribution of multiple fly species, including both general and localized examples.
