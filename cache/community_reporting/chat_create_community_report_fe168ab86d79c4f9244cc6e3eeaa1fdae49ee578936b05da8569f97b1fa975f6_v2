His work spanned multiple genera and species, with significant activity between 1888 and 1915. In 1888, he described the genus *Alloeostylus* and the species *Helina vanderwulpi*, and also contributed to the original description of *Helina calceataeformis* in 1911. The same year, he introduced *Hebecnema* in 1889, further establishing his expertise in dipteran taxonomy.  \n\nIn 1902, SCHNABL described the genus *Syngamoptera* and its species *Syngamoptera amurensis*, published in *Pyccx,aHTom,oбo3p.* (likely a transliteration of a Russian entomological journal). By 1911, his research expanded to include the genus *Spilogona*, as well as several species within *Phaonia*, such as *Phaonia hybrida* (1888), *Phaonia kowarzii* (1911, in *Horae Soc. Ent. Ross.*), and *Phaonia serva*. He also co-described *Drymeia tibetana* and the genus *Alliopsis* with Dziedzicki in 1911. That year, he introduced the genus *Paregla* and *Pegohylemyia*, and described the subgenus *Pegomyza* of *Eutrichota*, alongside the species *Eutrichota similis* (1911).  \n\nSCHNABL’s work extended to other genera, including *Coenosia* (notably *Coenosia lacustris*, though the exact year is unspecified), *Hylemya* (*Hylemya latifrons* in 1911), and *Hydrophoria* (*Hydrophoria fasciculata* in 1915 and *Hydrophoria nuda*). He was associated with the journal *Nova Acta Caesar.Leop. Carol.* for describing *Phaonia latipalpis* and other *Phaonia* species, and his research on *Pyrellia* was cited in 1911. Additionally, he was referenced for *Dialyta halterata* in the *Chinese Journal of Zoological Taxonomy* (动物分类学报).  \n\nSCHNABL’s career demonstrated a focus on both morphological classification and collaborative efforts, particularly with Dziedzicki. His descriptions of genera and species were foundational for later taxonomic studies, and his work in journals such as *Horae Soc. Ent. Ross.* and *Nova Acta* highlights his engagement with European and Russian entomological communities. Notably, he grouped *Chionomyia* and *Paregle* together in earlier classifications, though these were later separated. His legacy includes the original descriptions of *Helina obscuratoides* (1911) and *Helina calceataeformis* (1911), as well as the genus *Pegohylemyia*.  \n\nSCHNABL’s contributions were most prolific in the early 1900s, with key works published in 1911 and 1915. His meticulous documentation of Diptera species and genera, often in collaboration, solidified his role as a significant figure in entomological taxonomy during his era. The contradictions in the data, such as the unspecified year for *Coenosia lacustris* or the journal abbreviations, are resolved by prioritizing the most specific details provided (e.g., 1911 for *Phaonia kowarzii* in *Horae Soc. Ent. Ross.* and 1915 for *Hydrophoria fasciculata*). His work remains a critical reference for understanding the systematics of flies in the early 20th century.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",38\n833,HYDROPHORIA FASCICULATA,\"\n\n**Hydrophoria fasciculata** is a species of fly first described by taxonomist Schnabl in 1915. The species is characterized by distinct morphological features, including a head width that is 1.5 times the diameter of the frontal ocellus (a small, simple eye-like structure on the forehead) and four times the width of the gena (the area between the eye and the base of the antennae). Its body length measures approximately 6.5 millimeters, providing a key metric for identification. The taxonomic description event, which formally established the species, was conducted by Schnabl in the same year, 1915, as noted in both provided descriptions. \n\nGeographically, *Hydrophoria fasciculata* is known to inhabit the region of Heilongjiang in China, specifically in the area of Wuying. This information aligns across the descriptions, confirming its presence in this location. The species’ name and classification remain consistent in the data, with no contradictory details reported. \n\nIn summary, *Hydrophoria fasciculata* is a 6.5 mm-long fly species distinguished by its head proportions relative to the frontal ocellus and gena, first documented by Schnabl in 1915 and native to Wuying, Heilongjiang, China. The descriptions provided are non-conflicting and collectively establish its taxonomic history, physical traits, and geographic distribution.\",4\n1399,EUTRICHOTA (PEGOMYZA),A subgenus of Eutrichota described by Schnabl and Dziedzicki in 1911,3\n3351,NOVA ACTA CAESAR.LEOP.

It belongs to the Mydaeinae subfamily, a taxonomic group within the family Muscidae. The genus is distinguished by unique morphological features, particularly the specific arrangement of bristles on the thorax and wings, which serve as key diagnostic traits for its classification. These bristle patterns are critical for differentiating *HEBECNEMA* from other genera within the subfamily. While the descriptions provided do not elaborate further on ecological or behavioral characteristics, the taxonomic placement and morphological details highlight its significance in the study of fly biodiversity and evolutionary relationships. The genus remains a subject of interest for entomologists due to its specialized anatomical features and historical taxonomic context.\",2\n492,PAREGLA,,1\n1405,EUTRICHOTA SIMILIS,\"\n\n**EUTRICHOTA SIMILIS** is a species of fly belonging to the genus *Eutrichota*, first described by the entomologist Schnabl in 1911. It is native to China, where it has been documented as part of the region’s diverse fly fauna. The species is taxonomically distinguished by specific morphological features, including the presence of three lower orbital bristles on the head and yellow-colored tarsomeres (segments of the tarsi, or feet). These characteristics are critical for identifying *Eutrichota similis* within the broader context of its genus and family. While the first description emphasizes its classification under *Eutrichota*, the second provides additional diagnostic traits that align with its placement in the fly order (Diptera). Together, these details confirm that *Eutrichota similis* is a well-defined species within the genus, sharing its taxonomic lineage with other *Eutrichota* flies but uniquely identifiable by its bristle count and tarsal coloration. Its distribution is currently restricted to China, though further research may clarify its range or ecological preferences.

He co-described the species *Drymeia tibetana* alongside Schnabl, contributing to the understanding of this fly species. Together with Schnabl, he also co-authored the description of *Phaonia latipalpis*, which was published in the journal *Nova Acta Cæsarea Leopoldino-Carolina*. In the same year, Dziedzicki and Schnabl jointly proposed the genus *Alliopsis*, establishing its taxonomic framework. Their collaboration extended to resolving taxonomic relationships, as they classified *Chionomyia* and *Paregle* as conspecific genera, effectively synonymizing them. Additionally, Dziedzicki described the species *Halina moedlingensis*, further expanding his contributions to dipteran taxonomy. He was cited in 1911 for his work on the genus *Pyrrellia*, though the specific nature of his contribution (e.g., description, classification, or analysis) is not detailed. Notably, Dziedzicki also co-described the subgenus *Pegomyza* in 1911, indicating his involvement in refining the hierarchical classification of flies. His partnership with Schnabl appears to have been central to his scientific output during this period, with multiple publications and taxonomic decisions emerging from their joint efforts. While the exact scope of his independent work remains unclear, his role as a co-author and describer highlights his expertise in morphological and systematic studies of Diptera. All these contributions were published in 1911, suggesting a concentrated period of research activity. Dziedzicki’s legacy lies in his collaborative descriptions and classifications, which advanced the taxonomic knowledge of flies during the early 20th century.\",6\n1457,QILIAN MOUNTAINS,\"\n\nThe QILIAN MOUNTAINS are a prominent mountain range located in Qinghai, China, and are recognized as a significant geographical and ecological region. The area is notable for its association with several species of flies, particularly within the families Muscidae and Calliphoridae. Specifically, the Qilian Mountains are the location in Qinghai where *Pegomya prominens* is documented, a species often linked to specific environmental conditions found in alpine or high-altitude ecosystems. Additionally, the mountain range is reported to be the habitat of *Calliphora rohdendorfi*, a blow fly species that may play a role in decomposition processes or forensic studies in the region. The distribution of *Lispe cinifera*, a member of the family Muscidae, is also noted in the Qilian Mountains, further highlighting the area's biodiversity. Importantly, the Qilian Mountains in Qinghai serve as the type locality for *Drymeia tibetana*, a species whose classification and ecological role are tied to this specific geographic origin. \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize the presence of these insect species, they collectively underscore the Qilian Mountains' role as a critical ecological zone in Qinghai, supporting diverse arthropod populations. The mountain range's high-altitude environment likely contributes to the unique adaptations and distributions of these species, which are studied for their taxonomic significance and ecological functions. No contradictions exist among the provided data, as all descriptions consistently identify the Qilian Mountains as a location in Qinghai, China, associated with these specific fly species. The summary integrates all entities and their relationships, presenting a unified account of the region's biological relevance. \n\n(Word count: 150)\",2\n1883,NOVA ACTA ACADEMIA CAESAR LEOPOLD CAROLIN,A journal publishing Drymeia tibetana in 1911.>,1\n505,PEGOMYIA,\"Pegomya is a genus of flies described by R,D. in 1830, noted for features like the third antennal segment length-to-width ratio and broad labella in females\",4\n511,\"R,D.\",\"R,D. is a taxonomist who described the genus Pegomya in 1830\",1\n824,BA YINHE,\"River in Qinghai, China, associated with Hydrophoria fasciculata\",1\n3341,D'ASSIS FONCECA,Author of Phaonia umbraticola described in taxonomic literature,1\n1181,DEUTSCHE ENT.ZEITSCHR.,Journal where the genus Pegohylemyia was first described,1\n1657,REV.RUSS D‘ENT.,A journal where the species *Syngamoptera amurensis* was described,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2078,FAN,ALLIOPSIS,FAN is the primary author of the genus Alliopsis and multiple species,304\n5211,RINGDAHL,ENT MITT,Ringdahl published the species Coenosia luteipes in Ent.
