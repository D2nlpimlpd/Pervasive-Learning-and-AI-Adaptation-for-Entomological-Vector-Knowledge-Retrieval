Distributed in tropical regions.\",8\n2647,JIJI,\"\n\n**JIJI** is a geographical area in Taichung, Taiwan, recognized for its ecological and taxonomic significance in entomological studies. It is associated with the distribution of the fly species *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, which is documented in this region as part of its known range. Additionally, JIJI is cited as a location in Taiwan (notably, the term \"\"Taiwan, China\"\" in the second description is geographically imprecise, as Taiwan is a separate territory with complex political status; the correct reference is to Taiwan itself) where the fly *Helina lateralis* has been observed. The area also holds importance as the **type locality** for the species *Lasiopelta longicornis*, a term in taxonomy indicating the specific geographic location where the first specimen of a species was collected and described. \n\nThese associations highlight JIJI’s role as a site of biodiversity interest, particularly for dipteran (fly) species. The presence of *Dichaetomyia quadrata* and *Helina lateralis* suggests that the region supports habitats conducive to their life cycles, though specific ecological details about these species in JIJI are not provided in the descriptions. The designation of JIJI as the type locality for *Lasiopelta longicornis* underscores its historical and scientific value in the classification of this species, which is likely a beetle given the genus name *Lasiopelta* (a group within the family Chrysomelidae). \n\nWhile the descriptions do not clarify whether these species coexist in the same microhabitats within JIJI or if their associations are based on separate studies, the cumulative data position JIJI as a focal point for research on insect distribution and taxonomy in Taiwan. The mention of multiple species across different taxonomic groups (*Dichaetomyia* and *Helina* as flies, *Lasiopelta* as a beetle) indicates a diverse local fauna, though further ecological context would be needed to fully understand the interrelationships or conservation status of these species in the area. \n\nIn summary, JIJI in Taichung, Taiwan, is a location with documented ties to three distinct insect species: *Dichaetomyia quadrata* (fly), *Helina lateralis* (fly), and *Lasiopelta longicornis* (beetle), serving both as a distribution site and a type locality. Its role in scientific literature reflects its contribution to understanding regional biodiversity, though the descriptions provided lack detailed environmental or temporal context for these associations.\",2\n2645,SUPPL. ENT.,\"\n\n**SUPPL. ENT.** is a scientific journal recognized as the publication source for the taxonomic descriptions of two distinct species: *Limnophora albitarsis* and *Lasiopelta longicornis*. The journal has been cited as the venue where *Limnophora albitarsis*, a species within the genus *Limnophora* (likely a dipteran fly or related organism), was formally described and documented. Similarly, *Lasiopelta longicornis*, a species belonging to the genus *Lasiopelta* (potentially a beetle or insect with elongated antennae, as \"\"longicornis\"\" suggests long horns), was also first detailed in this publication. These entries highlight **SUPPL. ENT.** as a platform for entomological research, contributing to the classification and scientific understanding of insect biodiversity. The journal’s role in describing both species underscores its significance in the field of taxonomy, particularly for arthropods. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both consistently identify **SUPPL. ENT.** as the source for these species’ formal introductions.
