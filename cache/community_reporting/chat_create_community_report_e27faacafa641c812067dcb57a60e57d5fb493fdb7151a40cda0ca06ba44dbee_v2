Additionally, **Guling** has been identified as a habitat for **Pyrellia cyanicolor** (环斑孟蝇), a species of the family Calliphoridae, which was recorded in the locality. The Chinese term \"\"环斑孟蝇\"\" directly corresponds to *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, emphasizing its ecological relevance in the Guling area. These findings highlight Guling's role in supporting diverse dipteran populations, particularly within the context of forensic entomology or biodiversity studies, where such species distributions are critical for understanding local ecosystems. The region’s inclusion in scientific records for both *Lucilia hainanensis* and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* underscores its importance as a reference point for entomological research in Jiangxi.

The mountain is explicitly associated with the distribution of multiple fly species, including *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, *疏斑纹蝇* (a species likely translated as \"\"sparse-spotted fly\"\"), and *浙江孟蝇* (Zhejiang *Musca* species, though the exact taxonomic classification may require further verification). These associations highlight Tianmu Mountain as a critical area for entomological research and conservation.  \n\nSpecifically, Tianmu Mountain serves as the **type locality** (模式产地) for *疏斑纹蝇* and *浙江孟蝇*, meaning these species were first identified and described based on specimens collected from this region. The presence of *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* further underscores the mountain’s ecological diversity, as these species are documented within its distribution range. The mention of \"\"multiple fly species distributions\"\" in the data suggests that Tianmu Mountain supports a broader array of fly populations, potentially due to its unique environmental conditions, such as altitude, climate, or vegetation.  \n\nZhejiang Province, where Tianmu Mountain is situated, is known for its rich biodiversity, and the mountain’s role in harboring these specific fly species contributes to its scientific importance. The combination of type localities and distribution records indicates that Tianmu Mountain is not only a site of origin for certain species but also a habitat where they thrive. This dual role may make it a focal point for studies on species evolution, ecological adaptation, and regional entomology.  \n\nNo contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions consistently identify Tianmu Mountain as a location in Zhejiang Province linked to fly species. The summary integrates the entity’s role as both a type locality and a distribution area, emphasizing its multifaceted significance in the context of these species.

It serves as the **type locality** for *Huangshan guest night fly* (黄山客夜蝇), a species first described and documented in this region, highlighting its significance in entomological research. Additionally, the area is linked to *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, a species within the genus *Isomyia*, which is part of the family Muscidae. This connection underscores Huangshan’s role as a habitat for diverse fly populations, including those with specific ecological or taxonomic relevance.  \n\nFurther, the Huangshan region in Anhui Province is identified as a **distribution site** for two other fly species: *Zhejiang Meng Fly* (浙江孟蝇) and *Ring-spotted Meng Fly* (环斑孟蝇). These species, likely belonging to the same or related genera, contribute to the area’s biodiversity and ecological importance. The presence of these flies in the region suggests a complex interplay of environmental factors, such as altitude, climate, and vegetation, that support specialized insect communities.  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize different species, they collectively position Huangshan Mountain as a critical location for studying fly taxonomy and distribution in eastern China. The mountain’s unique ecosystem, characterized by its scenic landscapes and varied microhabitats, appears to foster the presence of both endemic and regionally significant species. The mention of \"\"type locality\"\" for *Huangshan guest night fly* and the distribution of *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Zhejiang Meng Fly*, and *Ring-spotted Meng Fly* in the area aligns with its reputation as a biodiversity hotspot.  \n\nNo contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as all consistently reference Anhui Province and associate the entity \"\"Huangshan\"\" with specific fly species.
