Distributed in Sichuan (China) and globally in Myanmar, India, Nepal, Pakistan.>\",6\n658,MYANMAR,\"\n\nMyanmar, a Southeast Asian country, is recognized as a significant region for the distribution of various insect species. It is home to the species *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, as well as the genus *Burmanomyia*, whose name directly references Myanmar (\"\"缅\"\" meaning \"\"Myanmar\"\" in Chinese). The country hosts multiple species of the genus *Isomyia*, including *Isomyia isomyia*, *Isomyia electa*, and *Isomyia viridaurea*, and is a distribution site for *Limnophora prominens*, *Limnophora exigua*, and *Limnophora albitarsis* (specifically noted in the northeastern region). Additionally, Myanmar is documented as a location for *Alikangiella vittata*, *Anthomyia plumiseta*, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, *Egle minuta*, *Haematobiosa austeni*, *Megophyra simpliceps*, and *Paradichosia scutellata*.  \n\nThe country also supports the distribution of several *Musca* species, such as *Musca bezzii*, *Musca pilifacies*, *Musca tibetana*, and *Musca crassirostris*, which are noted to have foreign or international distribution records in Myanmar. Furthermore, Myanmar is associated with the genus *Hoa*, a group of flies, and the species *Sarcosolomonia crinita*, which is reported as a foreign distribution area. The Indian greenbottle fly (*Lucilia cuprina*), *Pegomya quadrivittata*, and *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* are also documented in the region.  \n\nNotably, Myanmar serves as the type locality for *Limnophora apiciseta*, a species within the Limnophora genus, and is part of the broader distribution range for other species. The Chinese name \"\"614裸蹠芒蝇\"\" (likely a local identifier for a species in the *Dichaetomyia* genus) and \"\"毛瓣家蝇\"\" (translated as \"\"hairy-palped housefly,\"\" corresponding to *Musca pilifacies* or *Musca tibetana*) are explicitly cited as foreign distribution areas. The species *Calythea setifrons* is also reported in Myanmar as an international region.  \n\nIn summary, Myanmar’s biodiversity includes a wide array of fly species, with notable presence in genera such as *Isomyia*, *Limnophora*, *Musca*, and *Dichaetomyia*. It functions as both a primary habitat and an international distribution point for these insects, underscoring its ecological importance in Southeast Asia. The country’s role as a type locality for certain species and its inclusion in the global range of others highlight its relevance in entomological studies. This compilation reflects Myanmar’s contribution to the geographic diversity of these taxa, though further research may clarify specific ecological interactions or regional variations. (498 words)\",22\n2728,LIMNOPHORA PROMINENS,\"\n\n**Limnophora prominens** is a species of fly first described by Stein in 1904 in the journal *Tijdschrift voor Entomologie* (Tijdschr. Ent., 47, 106). It is characterized by a distinct triangular brown abdominal spot, a key morphological feature that aids in its identification. The species has a body length of approximately 4 mm, as noted in the second description. Morphologically, it also exhibits a unique anal plate structure, which further differentiates it from other members of the genus *Limnophora*.  \n\nGeographically, **Limnophora prominens** is distributed across several regions in Asia. It is native to **Guizhou, China**, and has a broader global presence in **Indonesia, India, Myanmar, and Japan**. These locations suggest a preference for subtropical to tropical climates, though specific ecological habitats or behavioral traits are not detailed in the provided data. The species’ range may indicate its adaptability to diverse environments within these regions, but further research would be required to confirm such patterns.  \n\nThe two descriptions provided are consistent in their core details, with the first emphasizing the triangular abdominal spot and anal plate structure, while the second adds the body length and journal citation. By synthesizing these, the summary highlights the species’ defining physical traits, its taxonomic history, and its geographic distribution. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, allowing for a unified account.  \n\nIn total, **Limnophora prominens** is a 4 mm-long fly species notable for its triangular brown abdominal marking and distinct anal plate morphology, originally documented by Stein in 1904. Its presence in Guizhou, China, and additional countries like Indonesia, India, Myanmar, and Japan underscores its regional significance in entomological studies. Further investigation into its ecology, life cycle, and interactions within these ecosystems could enhance understanding of its role in biodiversity.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",10\n2729,GUANGYI,A domestic distribution location for Limnophora prominens)|,1\n2730,ZHOU ZHIKUN,A person who collected Limnophora prominens in Guizhou)|,1\n2740,GUIYANG,\"\n\nGuiyang is a city located in Guizhou Province, China, and serves as a significant geographical reference in entomological studies. It is particularly noted for being the site where specimens of the species *Limnophora prominens* were collected, contributing to scientific research on this organism. Additionally, Guiyang is cited in the taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, a family of flies (Diptera: Sarcophagidae), indicating its relevance in the classification and identification of species within this group. The city’s role in both specimen collection and taxonomic documentation highlights its importance as a hub for biodiversity studies in the region. While the descriptions provided focus on specific scientific contexts, they collectively underscore Guiyang’s ecological and academic significance in the study of insect taxonomy and related biological research. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as both align on the city’s location and its association with entomological work.\",1\n4584,HENGCHUN PORT,\"\n\nHENGCHUN PORT is a coastal location situated in Hengchun, a town in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan, China. It is recognized as a site associated with the presence of two distinct species: *Sarcosolomonia crinita* and *Synorbitomyia linearis*. *Sarcosolomonia crinita* is a species of marine organism, potentially a type of algae or invertebrate, whose ecological or biological significance in the port area remains under study. Meanwhile, *Synorbitomyia linearis* is a species of fly, likely part of the Diptera order, which may inhabit or interact with the local environment of the port. The port’s connection to these species highlights its role as a biodiversity hotspot or a location of scientific interest for researchers studying marine and coastal ecosystems. While the descriptions do not specify the nature of the association (e.g., whether the species are native, invasive, or studied in the area), the repeated mention of Hengchun Port in relation to both organisms underscores its ecological relevance. The port’s geographical position in southern Taiwan, near the Hengchun Peninsula, may contribute to unique environmental conditions that support such species. Further research or documentation would be required to clarify the exact ecological relationships or conservation status of these organisms in the region. Overall, HENGCHUN PORT serves as a notable reference point for studies involving *Sarcosolomonia crinita* and *Synorbitomyia linearis*, reflecting its importance in local biodiversity and scientific inquiry.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9391,TAIWAN,SARCOSOLOMONIA CRINITA,The species Sarcosolomonia crinita is distributed in Taiwan,120\n3303,POLIETES FUSCISQUAMOSUS,EMDEN,Emden described the species Polietes fuscisquamosus in 1965,36\n3603,MYANMAR,MUSCA PILIFACIES,Musca pilifacies is distributed in Myanmar,29\n4847,LIMNOPHORA PROMINENS,GUANGYI,\"Limnophora prominens is distributed in Guangyi, Guizhou\",11\n4848,LIMNOPHORA PROMINENS,ZHOU ZHIKUN,Zhou ZhiKun collected Limnophora prominens in Guizhou,11\n4856,LIMNOPHORA PROMINENS,GUIYANG,\"The species is found in Guiyang, Guizhou\",11\n9395,HENGCHUN PORT,SARCOSOLOMONIA CRINITA,\"The species Sarcosolomonia crinita is found in Hengchun Port, Taiwan\",7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
