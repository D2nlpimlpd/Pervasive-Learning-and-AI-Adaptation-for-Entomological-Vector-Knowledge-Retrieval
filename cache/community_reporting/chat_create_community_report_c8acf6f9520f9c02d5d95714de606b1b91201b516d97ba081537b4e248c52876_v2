However, there is a minor contradiction in the descriptions of the sclerotization of these structures, with one noting strong sclerotization and another describing weakly sclerotized processes. This discrepancy may reflect variations within the subgenus or differing interpretations of the same anatomical features. Despite this, the defining characteristics of *Phallantha* remain consistent and are essential for its identification and phylogenetic placement. The subgenus was later merged into the genus *Pierretia*, indicating a shift in its taxonomic hierarchy.

Rohdendorf's ability to define distinct morphological and taxonomic features has provided a framework for understanding the evolutionary relationships and biodiversity of flies in the family Sarcophagidae. His influence is evident in the continued use of the subgenera he described, even after some have been reclassified elsewhere; for example, *Phallantha* is now considered part of *Pierretiae*.

Rohdendorf in 1938. Initially classified under the genus *Sarcophaga*, it is characterized by distinct morphological features, including paired downward side projections on the epandrium (a structure of the male genitalia) and bifurcated lateral processes. These traits, however, present a minor contradiction in the provided descriptions: one notes \"\"strong sclerotization of membrane-like projections,\"\" while another describes \"\"weakly sclerotized membranous processes.\"\" This discrepancy may reflect differing interpretations of the same structures or variations within the subgenus, but the defining features consistently emphasize the epandrial projections and lateral processes. The type species of *Phallantha* is *Phallantha sichotealini* Rohdendorf, 1938, which anchors its taxonomic classification. Notably, subsequent taxonomic revisions have merged *Phallantha* into the genus *Pierretia*, indicating a shift in its hierarchical placement. Despite this reclassification, the subgenus retains its historical significance as a morphologically distinct group within the family Sarcophagidae. Rohdendorf’s original work established *Phallantha* as a key taxonomic unit, and its integration into *Pierretia* underscores the dynamic nature of classification in entomology. The subgenus remains notable for its unique anatomical adaptations, which aid in species identification and phylogenetic studies.\",4\n4661,ROH DENDORF,\"\n\nROH DENDORF (likely a variant of \"\"Rohdendorf\"\") was an entomologist known for his contributions to the classification and description of insect species and subgenera. In 1956, he formally described the **Alashan Wohlfahrtia** species, a significant addition to the study of flies (Diptera) or related insect groups. Additionally, Rohdendorf is credited with establishing the subgenera **Bellieriomima**, **Pseudothyrsocnema**, and **Asiopierretia**, which are used to categorize specific lineages within broader insect genera. These subgenera reflect his expertise in taxonomic entomology, particularly in organizing and defining morphological or ecological distinctions among insect populations. While the first description highlights his work on a species-level classification, the second underscores his role in refining subgeneric taxonomy, indicating a multifaceted career in entomological research. The discrepancy in the entity name (\"\"ROH DENDORF\"\" vs. \"\"Rohdendorf\"\") may stem from formatting or transcription errors, but the core information about his scientific contributions remains consistent. Rohdendorf’s work, spanning both species and subgeneric classifications, has provided foundational insights for subsequent studies in entomology, particularly in regions where these taxa are prevalent. His 1956 description of Alashan Wohlfahrtia and the establishment of the three subgenera demonstrate his impact on understanding insect biodiversity and evolutionary relationships.\",6\n5054,PHALLANTHA SICHOTEALINI,,1\n5043,PSEUDO THYRSOCNEMA,\"Pseudothyrsocnema is a subgenus of Sarcophaga, characterized by a central process without proximal setae and membranous processes with microtrichia.
