In 1986, YAO collaborated with Chen to formally describe *Pierretia (s.str.) recurvata*, a species within the genus *Pierretia* (sensu stricto), contributing to the classification and documentation of this taxon. Earlier, in 1984, YAO served as a co-author in the description of *Tainanina yangchunensis*, a species belonging to the genus *Tainanina*. These contributions highlight YAO's involvement in botanical or zoological taxonomy, depending on the context of the species, and demonstrate their role in advancing scientific understanding of these groups. Both works were published in the 1980s, with the *Pierretia* description occurring two years after the *Tainanina* publication. While the specific fields of study for these species are not detailed in the provided data, the use of Latin binomial nomenclature suggests they are biological taxa. YAO's collaborations with other researchers, such as Chen, underscore their engagement in collective scientific efforts during this period.
