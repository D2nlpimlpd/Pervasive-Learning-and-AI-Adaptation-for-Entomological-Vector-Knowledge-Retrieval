It serves as the primary reference location for the description and classification of several *Pegomya* species, including *Pegomya hamatacrophalla*, *Pegomya angusticerca*, *Pegomya simpliciforceps*, *Pegomya flaviprecoxa*, *Pegomya dichaetomyiola*, *Pegomya nudapicalis*, and *Pegomya folifera*.

The mountain is also the type locality for *Phorbia perssoni* and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, further underscoring its importance in entomological research. Additionally, E’Mei Mountain is associated with *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis*, a species within the blowfly family, though the exact nature of this association (e.g., type locality or simply presence) is not specified in the descriptions. Beyond these, the site is home to *Silbomyia hoeneana*, which is distributed in the region but not explicitly noted as a type locality. The repeated emphasis on E’Mei Mountain as a type locality for multiple *Pegomya* species and others highlights its ecological and scientific value as a hub for biodiversity and taxonomic studies. The descriptions collectively confirm the mountain’s role in the discovery and documentation of these species, with no contradictions in the data provided.
