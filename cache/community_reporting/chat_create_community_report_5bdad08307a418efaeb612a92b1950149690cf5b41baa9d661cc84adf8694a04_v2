Additionally, **Baikal Lake** functions as the type locality for *Heteronychia bajkalensis*, a species first identified and described from this region, underscoring its role in scientific discovery. Both species highlight the lake’s ecological distinctiveness, though they pertain to different taxonomic groups—dipterans (flies) and odonates (dragonflies). The descriptions provided are consistent in identifying the lake’s location in Siberia and its connection to these species, with no contradictions requiring resolution. **Baikal Lake** remains a focal point for biodiversity studies, particularly for organisms endemic to its ecosystem.\",1\n4391,FENGZHEN,A location in Inner Mongolia where Macronychia griseola is found.>,1\n4390,ERENTHOT,A location in Inner Mongolia where Macronychia polyodon is found.>,1\n4444,SHEPHICIDAE,,1\n4445,MILTORGAMMOIDES ZIMINI,\"Miltogrammoides zimini is a species of fly described by Rohdendorf in 1935, found in Inner Mongolia (Erlianhaote) and the Soviet Union (Uzbekistan, Chiva)\",5\n4460,MILTORGAMMOIDES,,1\n4449,ERLIANHAOTE,Erlianhaote is a location in Inner Mongolia where Miltogrammoides zimini is found,1\n2947,BRONTEA HUMILIS,Brontaea humilis is a species of Brontaea genus described by Zetterstedt in 1860,3\n5272,ROHENDENROF,Rohdendorf is a taxonomist who described multiple species including Parasarcophaga parkeri and Parasarcophaga jacobsoni,2\n5275,PARASARCOPHAGA PARKERI,A species of fly (Parasarcophaga parkeri) described by Rohdendorf in 1937,1\n5789,CHIFENG,Chifeng is a city in Inner Mongolia associated with the study of the fly species' hosts,2\n5790,LI RONGBO,\"Li Rongbo is a researcher in Chifeng, Inner Mongolia, linked to the host relationship study\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10044,PARASARCOPHAGA JACOBSONI,HEILONGJIANG,\"The species Parasarcophaga jacobsoni is distributed in Heilongjiang Province, China\",199\n571,INNER MONGOLIA,STROBILOMYIA LARICICOLA,Strobilomyia laricicola is distributed in Inner Mongolia,174\n8303,MACRONYCHIA GRISOLO,INNER MONGOLIA,The species is distributed in Inner Mongolia,168\n11572,\"HORAE SOC,ENT.ROSS.\",INNER MONGOLIA,\"The Horae Soc,ent.ross. documents species found in Inner Mongolia\",167\n8778,1257陈氏污蝇,EUROPE,1257陈氏污蝇 is documented in Europe's foreign distribution,150\n5735,HELINA PARCEPILOSA,STEIN,Stein described the species Helina parcepilosa in 1907,131\n8445,MILTORGAMMA,MEIGEN,Meigen described the Miltogramma genus in 1803,125\n8418,APODACRA,MACQUART,Macquart described the genus Apodacra in 1854,25\n5651,POLAND,HELINA OBSCURATOIDES,The species Helina obscuratoides is distributed in Poland,19\n8466,MILTORGAMMA ASIATICUM,TUMERTEI,\"Miltogramma asiaticum is found in Tumertei, Inner Mongolia\",14\n8461,SOUTHERN ASIA,MILTORGAMMA TESTACEIFRONS,Miltogramma testaceifrons is distributed in Southern Asia,12\n8469,MILTORGAMMA ASIATICUM,BAYI CITY,\"Miltogramma asiaticum is found in Bayi City, Xinjiang\",11\n8448,MILTORGAMMA,MILTORGAMMA BIMACULATUM,Miltogramma bimaculatum is a species within the Miltogramma genus,10\n8465,MILTORGAMMA TESTACEIFRONS,DONGWU BANNER,\"Miltogramma testaceifrons is found in Dongwu Banner, Inner Mongolia\",10\n1279,DELIA FLORILEGA,DIPTERA SCANDINAVICA,Delia florilega was published in Diptera Scandinavica,9\n8305,MACRONYCHIA GRISOLO,TUMERTEI,\"The species is found in Tumertei, Inner Mongolia\",9\n8451,VON ROSE,MILTORGAMMA TESTACEIFRONS,Von Roser described Miltogramma testaceifrons in 1840,9\n9692,密刺伊麻蝇,LI YE LIU,\"Li, Ye et Liu 于 1985 年首次描述了密刺伊麻蝇\",8\n8458,DEQIN BAIMANG SNOW MOUNTAIN,MILTORGAMMA BIMACULATUM,\"Miltogramma bimaculatum is found in Deqin Baimang Snow Mountain, Yunnan\",7\n8459,SOUTHERN SLOPE OF DEQIN BAIMANG SNOW MOUNTAIN,MILTORGAMMA BIMACULATUM,Miltogramma bimaculatum is found on the southern slope of Deqin Baimang Snow Mountain,7\n8460,SOUTHERN SLOPE,MILTORGAMMA BIMACULATUM,Miltogramma bimaculatum is found on the southern slope of Deqin Baimang Snow Mountain,7\n556,ELBERG,STROBILOMYIA BAICALENSIS,Elberg described the species Strobilomyia baicalensis,6\n592,BAIKAL LAKE,ELBERG,\"Elberg described the species Strobilomyia baicalensis, which is distributed in the Baikal Lake region of Siberia\",6\n8304,MACRONYCHIA GRISOLO,FENGZHEN,\"The species is found in Fengzhen, Inner Mongolia\",6\n8306,MACRONYCHIA GRISOLO,ERENTHOT,\"The species is found in Erenhot, Inner Mongolia\",6\n8422,APODACRA,SHEPHICIDAE,Apodacra larvae prey on wasps (Sphecidac),6\n8439,MILTORGAMMOIDES ZIMINI,MILTORGAMMOIDES,Miltogrammoides zimini is a species within the Miltogrammoides genus,6\n8442,MILTORGAMMOIDES ZIMINI,ERLIANHAOTE,\"Miltogrammoides zimini is found in Erlianhaote, Inner Mongolia\",6\n5295,BRONTEA HUMILIS,DIPTERA SCANDINAVICA,\"Brontaea humilis is referenced in Dipt, Scand.\",5\n10038,ROHENDENROF,PARASARCOPHAGA PARKERI,Rohdendorf is the author who described the species Parasarcophaga parkeri in 1937,3\n11281,CHIFENG,LI RONGBO,Li Rongbo is associated with research activities in Chifeng,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
