It is found in Xinjiang and parts of Europe and Turkey.\",4\n1224,新疆,\"\n\nXinjiang, officially the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is a geographically and ecologically diverse region in northwest China, renowned for its role as a critical distribution area for numerous fly species. It serves as a domestic habitat for multiple genera and species, including **Protocalliphora azurea**, **Protocalliphora chrysorrhoea**, and **Phormiata** species, as well as **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa** and **Musca vitripennis**. The region is also home to **Sarcophila rasnitzyni**, **Mesembrina resplendens** (specifically in the Habahe River area), **简莫蝇** (a Chinese species), and **Pyrellia cyanicolor**. Additionally, Xinjiang hosts **Hypoderma lineatum** and **Hypoderma sinense** (commonly known as bot flies), **高山泉种蝇** (a species of fruit fly), and **Pollenia pseudo rudis**, a blow fly.  \n\nThe autonomous region supports a range of **Eutrichota** species, such as **E. hamata**, **E. quadrirecta**, **E. pilimana pilimarginata**, **E. pamirensis**, and **E. nigriscens**, as well as **棕翅阳蝇** (a Chinese hoverfly) and **陈氏污蝇**, **介污蝇**, and **巴彦污蝇** (species of the genus *Chrysomya* or related). It is a key area for **Dasyphora** species and **Gasterophilus** species, which include horse bots. The **Rypellia** genus is also documented in Xinjiang, with specific mentions of Shawan and other locations. Notably, **三鬃亚麻蝇** (a species of *Eutrichota* or related) and **紫鼻狂蝇**/**宽额鼻狂蝇** (likely *Gasterophilus* or *Hypoderma* species) are part of its fauna.  \n\nXinjiang is the type locality for **拟山字泉种蝇** (a species of fruit fly), with the holotype collected in Urumqi. It is a distribution site for **1287肿额潘麻蝇** (a species of *Parasarcophaga* or similar genus) and **1526鼻胃蝇** (possibly a *Hypoderma* species). The region is also associated with **查禾短须寄蝇** (a tachinid fly) and **牛皮蝇** (another term for *Hypoderma* species).  \n\nThese species reflect Xinjiang’s ecological significance as a hub for diverse fly populations, influenced by its arid to semi-arid climate, mountainous terrain, and unique biodiversity. The data consistently identifies Xinjiang as a Chinese autonomous region, though some descriptions refer to it as a \"\"province\"\" or \"\"geographical region,\"\" which are resolved by its official status as an autonomous region. The presence of multiple genera, including *Eutrichota*, *Hypoderma*, *Pollenia*, and *Rypellia*, underscores its role in supporting both common and specialized insect species. Specific localities like the Habahe River and Shawan highlight microhabitats within Xinjiang that contribute to this diversity. Overall, Xinjiang’s fly fauna is a vital component of its broader ecological and zoological profile.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",34\n5990,亚洲象胃蝇,亚洲象胃蝇C.elephantis是象胃蝇属的一个种，我国自缅甸输入的亚洲象体内获得。,2\n4112,山伏蝇PHORMIATA PHORMIATA,\"A species within the Phormiata genus, found in China's Qinghai and Xinjiang, and internationally in the Soviet Union (Tajikistan).
