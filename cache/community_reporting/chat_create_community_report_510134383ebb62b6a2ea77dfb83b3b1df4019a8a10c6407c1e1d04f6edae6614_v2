The city’s inclusion in the distribution of both species highlights its ecological relevance for studying blowfly populations in the region. While the descriptions note the alternative spelling \"\"Qiqihaer,\"\" the standard and widely accepted name is \"\"Qiqihar,\"\" which is consistently used in administrative and geographic contexts. The data collectively confirm Qiqihar’s status as a key location in Heilongjiang for the presence of these two blowfly species, underscoring its importance in entomological research and related scientific applications.

Additionally, Tahe is home to *Delia penicillaris*, another species documented within its geographical boundaries, further underscoring the area's biodiversity. Beyond these, the county is also significant in entomological research as the location where the holotype of *Spilogona costalis* was collected. A holotype serves as the single physical example used to formally describe and name a species, indicating that Tahe has contributed to the scientific classification of this particular fly species. While the descriptions emphasize different biological associations, they collectively affirm Tahe's status as a key ecological and taxonomic site in Heilongjiang province, with a focus on its role in the distribution and study of these specific organisms.
