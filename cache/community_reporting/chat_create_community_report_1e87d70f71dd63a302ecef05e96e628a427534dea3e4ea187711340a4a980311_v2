Ackland first described the species *Strobilomyia infrequens* in 1965, with later records of this species in Nepal linked to their work in 1967. In the same year, 1967, Ackland also documented the distribution of *Lasiomma strigilatum* in Nepal, contributing to regional entomological knowledge. Additionally, they described *Hylemya probilis* and *Hylemya vagans* in 1967, both belonging to the genus *Hylemya*. Ackland’s research extended to other species, including *Calythea setifrons*, described in 1986, and *Pamir Pseudomyopina pamirensis*, for which they are credited as the author. Their work is frequently cited in species descriptions and references, indicating a significant role in taxonomic studies. Ackland’s entomological research is notably tied to the UK, as highlighted in the description of *Strobilomyia infrequens*. While some records mention Nepal (e.g., *Strobilomyia infrequens* in 1967 and *Lasiomma strigilatum* in 1967), these appear to reflect subsequent documentation or regional studies rather than original descriptions, as the 1965 date for *Strobilomyia infrequens* is explicitly noted as the year of its initial description.
