He is credited as the author of *Tachina setosa* in the *Systematic Description of European Two-winged Insects*, a work that contributed to the classification of Diptera (true flies) in Europe. Additionally, Brischke described *Tachina omnivora* in the same year, further establishing his role in documenting the biodiversity of this insect group. His taxonomic efforts, particularly in 1885, are linked to both species, indicating his active involvement in entomological research during that period. The descriptions of these species appear in the same publication or related works, as all references point to 1885 as the year of their formal classification. Brischke’s contributions highlight his expertise in Dipteran taxonomy and his significance in the scientific community for advancing the understanding of European two-winged insects. The consistency across the descriptions—each attributing both species to Brischke in 1885—supports the conclusion that he was the primary author for these classifications, with no contradictions to resolve. His work remains a foundational reference for studies on *Tachina* species and their ecological roles.\",2\n5861,PALM,Author of Voria spinicosta (1876) in the Systematic Description of European Two-winged Insects,1\n5862,D'AGUILAR,Author of Voria ciliata (1957) in the Systematic Description of European Two-winged Insects,1\n5540,TACHINA OMNIVORA,Tachina omnivora is a species of tachinid fly described by Brischke in 1885.,2\n5571,AKADEMIENS HANDLINGAR,\"Academy's Proceedings, referenced in the species description context\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11424,SYST.BESCHR.EUR.ZWEIFLUG.LNSEKTEN,BRISCHKE,Brischke described Tachina setosa in the Systematic Description of European Two-winged Insects,6\n11425,SYST.BESCHR.EUR.ZWEIFLUG.LNSEKTEN,PALM,Palm described Voria spinicosta in the Systematic Description of European Two-winged Insects,5\n11427,SYST.BESCHR.EUR.ZWEIFLUG.LNSEKTEN,D'AGUILAR,d'Aguilar described Voria ciliata in the Systematic Description of European Two-winged Insects,5\n10645,BRISCHKE,TACHINA OMNIVORA,Brischke described the species Tachina omnivora in 1885,4\n10655,AKADEMIENS HANDLINGAR,TACHINA OMNIVORA,The Academy's Proceedings is referenced in the description of Tachina omnivora,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
