The province is also home to species such as **Lucilia sinensis** and **Lucilia shenyangensis**, both belonging to the blowfly genus *Lucilia*, which are likely associated with decomposition or forensic contexts.  \n\nFurther, Zhejiang is identified as a distribution site for three *Isomyia* species: **Isomyia pseudolucilia**, **Isomyia oestracea**, and **Isomyia furcicula**, which are parasitic flies often linked to avian hosts. The **Protocalliphora azurea**, a species of bot fly, is also documented in the province, as is **Cocytodes coerulea**, a member of the *Cocytodes* genus. The **Pyrrellia cyanicolor**, a fly species, is explicitly stated to inhabit Zhejiang, contributing to its entomological diversity.  \n\nIn terms of more specific or cataloged species, Zhejiang is a domestic location for three *Chrysomya* species: **1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇** (Chrysomya gray-powdered narrow-cheeked flesh fly), **1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇** (Chrysomya gray-bellied narrow-cheeked flesh fly), and **1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇** (Chrysomya Sumatran narrow-cheeked flesh fly), though the numerical prefixes may indicate catalog or taxonomic identifiers. The province is also a distribution area for **Zhejiang *Megaselia*** (浙江孟蝇) and **ring-spotted *Megaselia*** (环斑孟蝇), both part of the *Megaselia* genus, which includes small, often parasitic or saprophagous flies. Additionally, **sparsely spotted *Megaselia*** (疏斑纹蝇) is noted as a species found in Zhejiang.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Zhejiang’s role as a significant ecological hub for multiple fly species, including parasitic, predatory, and decomposer varieties. These species are associated with diverse habitats, such as pine forests (for the pine caterpillar parasitic fly) and broader ecosystems supporting blowflies, bot flies, and other dipterans. The presence of both widely distributed genera (e.g., *Lucilia*, *Isomyia*) and regionally specific species underscores the province’s importance in entomological studies. While some entries use scientific names and others rely on Chinese terminology, the data aligns in confirming Zhejiang as a shared or primary distribution area for these organisms. The summary integrates all provided information, resolving any ambiguity by treating each species as distinct unless explicitly linked. This highlights Zhejiang’s contribution to China’s rich insect biodiversity and its relevance in ecological and taxonomic research.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",17\n5494,浙江富阳亚林所,\"Zhejiang Fuyang Sub-forestry Institute, associated with Algedonia coclesalis Walker and researcher Xu Tiansen\",2\n358,西藏,\"\n\nTibet (西藏), an autonomous region in China, is a significant distribution area for various fly species. The region hosts the Chinese endemic species *Dichaetomyia bibax*, as well as *Aplomyia*, a genus of flies. It is also home to 瘦喙近脉花蝇 (slender-billed near-veined flower fly) and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*. Notably, Tibet serves as a domestic distribution location for *Delia echinata* and the species 1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇 (1464 Sumatran narrow-cheeked parasitic fly), with the latter’s catalog number included in its name. The region supports Dasyphora species, and Rypellia (possibly a typo for *Pyrellia*; clarification needed) is documented in multiple locations, including Linzhi, Bomi Yigong, Cayu, Bomi, and Baxiong Ranwu. \n\nTibet is part of the distribution range for 黑瓣莫蝇 (*Pyrellia cyanicolor*), a species whose name appears in both Chinese and Latin. The autonomous region is also a key habitat for 兔裸皮蝇 (hare skin fly) in China’s southwest and 紫鼻狂蝇 (purple-nosed horn fly). Additionally, it is the type locality for 角板鬃粪蝇 (horned plate bristle fly), with the specific site being Aasan Tree (亚东阿桑树) in Subeast (Subeast may refer to a local area or a misrendered term; further verification required). The region is explicitly noted as the domestic distribution area for 西藏疣麻蝇 (*Sarcophaga tibetana*, 1289), a species named after Tibet. \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to Tibet as a \"\"province,\"\" this is inaccurate; it is officially an autonomous region. The data collectively highlight Tibet’s ecological role in supporting diverse fly populations, including both endemic and regionally distributed species. Specific localities within Tibet, such as Linzhi and Bomi Yigong, are critical for certain genera like Rypellia. The inclusion of scientific names in both Chinese and Latin (e.g., *Pyrellia cyanicolor* for 黑瓣莫蝇) underscores the region’s importance in entomological studies. Catalog numbers (e.g., 1464, 1289) suggest these species are part of formal taxonomic records. Overall, Tibet’s unique environment contributes to the biodiversity of flies, with implications for ecological and agricultural research in China’s southwest. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",14\n5496,余有森,Individual associated with the entity 稻苞虫 in Zhejiang,1\n5645,梁恩义,梁恩义 is a researcher who documented the parasitism of Calpe capucina Esper by 1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇 in Beijing.>,1\n2165,福建,\"\n\nFujian is a province located in southeastern China, known for its diverse ecosystems and as a significant domestic distribution area for various species of flies and parasitic insects. The region is home to multiple species within the families Calliphoridae (blowflies) and Tachinidae (tachinid flies), including *Lucilia hainanensis*, *Musca chui*, and *Musca vitripennis*. Additionally, Fujian hosts the *Isomyia* genus, with documented distributions of *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Isomyia oestracea*, and *Isomyia furcicula*. The province is also a key habitat for the *Harpagophalla kempi* species, which has been recorded in cities such as Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Zhangpu, and Xiamen. Notably, three specific parasitic fly species—1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇 (*Chrysomya* sp.), 1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇, and 1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇—are documented as domestic to Fujian, though their exact scientific classifications may require further verification. \n\nFujian’s biodiversity extends to other fly species, including 松毛虫缅麻蝇 (a parasitic fly associated with pine caterpillars) and 环斑孟蝇 (*Musca* sp.), both of which are part of the province’s ecological inventory. The 疏斑纹蝇 (*Musca* sp.) is also noted as a species distributed in Fujian, contributing to the region’s entomological richness. While some descriptions mention Nanjing as a location within Fujian, this is geographically inaccurate, as Nanjing is the capital of Jiangsu Province. The correct cities associated with Fujian in the data are Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, Zhangpu, and Xiamen, which serve as focal points for the presence of these species. \n\nIn summary, Fujian functions as a critical ecological zone in China for the distribution of numerous fly and parasitic insect species. Its role as a habitat for both common and specialized species, such as those in the *Isomyia* and *Musca* genera, underscores its importance in regional biodiversity. The province’s specific locations, including Fuzhou and Xiamen, are highlighted for their association with certain species, while the inclusion of catalog numbers (e.g., 1461, 1463, 1464) for gray-faced and Sumatran narrow-cheeked tachinid flies indicates systematic documentation of these insects. Despite minor inconsistencies in the data (e.g., the incorrect reference to Nanjing), Fujian’s status as a hub for these species remains well-supported by the provided descriptions.\",11\n2033,牯岭,\"\n\n**Guling (牯岭)** is a location situated in **Jiangxi Province, China**, and is recognized as a significant site for the distribution of specific fly species. The area is associated with the presence of **Lucilia hainanensis**, a blow fly species documented in the region. Additionally, **Guling** has been identified as a habitat for **Pyrellia cyanicolor** (环斑孟蝇), a species of the family Calliphoridae, which was recorded in the locality. The Chinese term \"\"环斑孟蝇\"\" directly corresponds to *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, emphasizing its ecological relevance in the Guling area. These findings highlight Guling's role in supporting diverse dipteran populations, particularly within the context of forensic entomology or biodiversity studies, where such species distributions are critical for understanding local ecosystems. The region’s inclusion in scientific records for both *Lucilia hainanensis* and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* underscores its importance as a reference point for entomological research in Jiangxi. No contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as all consistently identify Guling as part of Jiangxi Province and link it to the distribution of these two fly species.\",1\n4038,噶洛山,印度噶洛山（Garo Hills），环斑孟蝇的分布地,1\n4039,卡西山,印度卡西山（Khasi Hills），环斑孟蝇的分布地,1\n2021,PYRELLIA CYANICOLOR,\"Pyrellia cyanicolor is a species described by Ouchi in 1938, found in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Tibet.

The mountain is explicitly associated with the distribution of multiple fly species, including *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, *疏斑纹蝇* (a species likely translated as \"\"sparse-spotted fly\"\"), and *浙江孟蝇* (Zhejiang *Musca* species, though the exact taxonomic classification may require further verification). These associations highlight Tianmu Mountain as a critical area for entomological research and conservation.  \n\nSpecifically, Tianmu Mountain serves as the **type locality** (模式产地) for *疏斑纹蝇* and *浙江孟蝇*, meaning these species were first identified and described based on specimens collected from this region. The presence of *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* further underscores the mountain’s ecological diversity, as these species are documented within its distribution range. The mention of \"\"multiple fly species distributions\"\" in the data suggests that Tianmu Mountain supports a broader array of fly populations, potentially due to its unique environmental conditions, such as altitude, climate, or vegetation.  \n\nZhejiang Province, where Tianmu Mountain is situated, is known for its rich biodiversity, and the mountain’s role in harboring these specific fly species contributes to its scientific importance. The combination of type localities and distribution records indicates that Tianmu Mountain is not only a site of origin for certain species but also a habitat where they thrive. This dual role may make it a focal point for studies on species evolution, ecological adaptation, and regional entomology.  \n\nNo contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions consistently identify Tianmu Mountain as a location in Zhejiang Province linked to fly species. The summary integrates the entity’s role as both a type locality and a distribution area, emphasizing its multifaceted significance in the context of these species. The mountain’s association with *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, *疏斑纹蝇*, and *浙江孟蝇* collectively establishes it as a key site for understanding fly biodiversity in the region.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",4\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n7578,浙江孟蝇,FAN,Fan于1965年描述了浙江孟蝇,307\n2742,黄山客夜蝇XENOTACHINA HUANGSHANENSIS,FAN,Fan described the species 黄山客夜蝇 as a new species,298\n3396,黑瓣莫蝇,MALLOCH,Malloch described the species 黑瓣莫蝇 in 1928,60\n9278,松毛虫缅麻蝇,SENIOR-WHITE,Senior-White described the species 松毛虫缅麻蝇 in 1924,54\n10887,1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇,辽宁,\"1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇 is distributed in Liaoning, China\",52\n3627,MUSCA VENTROSA,WIEDEMANN,Wiedemann described the species *Musca ventrosa* in 1830,42\n3839,钱,内蒙古,钱 conducted research on Rypellia in Inner Mongolia,38\n6621,ENC.ENT.,江苏,The journal lists Jiangsu as a distribution location for Lucilia hainanensis,37\n10900,1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇,黑龙江,\"1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇 is distributed in Heilongjiang, China\",34\n10921,1465松毛虫狭颊寄蝇,吉林,\"1465松毛虫狭颊寄蝇 is distributed in Jilin, China\",34\n6623,ENC.ENT.,江西,The journal lists Jiangxi as a distribution location for Lucilia hainanensis,32\n8725,北京,拉氏麻野蝇,The species *Sarcophila rasnitzyni* is distributed in Beijing,26\n10912,1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇,北京,\"1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇 is distributed in Beijing, China\",26\n5520,云南,\"SUPPLTA.
