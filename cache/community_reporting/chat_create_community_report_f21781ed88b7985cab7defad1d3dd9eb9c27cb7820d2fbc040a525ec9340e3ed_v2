Their work is cited in multiple contexts, including the **1940 Australian study**, the **Illustris Greenbottle Fly** (*Lucilia illustris*) in **Europe and Asia**, and species descriptions in **Malaya and Thailand**. Additionally, they are referenced for a **1910 publication**, though the 1940 work appears to be their most significant contribution.  \n\nThe 1940 study by Senior-White et al. focused on entomological research, with a particular emphasis on **dipteran species** (flies). It provided critical documentation of the **Illustris Greenbottle Fly** in **Europe and Asia**, expanding understanding of its geographic range. Simultaneously, the group described species in **Malaya and Thailand**, regions within the broader **Oriental biogeographic zone**, and contributed to the 1940 Australian study, which likely addressed regional biodiversity. Their work in the **Garo Hills of India** (a part of the Oriental region) further underscores their role in cataloging species in South and Southeast Asia.  \n\nWhile some sources mention a 1910 reference, the majority of citations pertain to the 1940 publication, suggesting it was a landmark work in the field. The apparent contradictions in regional focus (e.g., Australia vs. Europe/Asia) are resolved by recognizing that the **Oriental and Australian regions** are adjacent biogeographic zones, and the 1940 study may have encompassed both. Senior-White et al. are credited with synthesizing data on species distribution, including the **Illustris Greenbottle Fly**, which is notable for its ecological and forensic significance. Their descriptions of species in **Malaya, Thailand, and the Garo Hills** highlight their contribution to regional entomology, particularly in understudied areas.  \n\nThe group’s work remains foundational for understanding the historical distribution of dipteran species in these regions. Though the exact composition of the group is unspecified, their collaborative effort in the 1940s reflects the interdisciplinary nature of early 20th-century taxonomic research. The 1910 reference may pertain to earlier contributions or a different publication, but the 1940 work is consistently highlighted as their most impactful. Senior-White et al. are thus recognized as key figures in documenting the biodiversity of the **Oriental and Australian regions**, with a focus on **flies** and their ecological roles.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",7\n3623,LUCILIA SINENSIS,Species name with authorship by Aubertin,2\n3539,CALLIPHORINAE,\"\n\nCalliphorinae is a subfamily of the fly family Calliphoridae (丽蝇亚科), characterized by distinct morphological features in both adults and larvae. Adult members of this subfamily are notable for their arc-shaped m1+2 wing veins, a key taxonomic trait that differentiates them from other calliphorid groups. Female Calliphorinae also possess a telescopic ovipositor, an adaptation that facilitates efficient egg-laying. In contrast, larval characteristics exhibit variability, as some species within the subfamily have larvae with pharyngeal appendages, while others do not. This diversity in larval morphology suggests potential ecological or functional adaptations among different species.  \n\nThe subfamily includes species such as *Hypopygiopsis infumata* and *Hemipyrellia ligurriens*, which are representative of its taxonomic breadth. These species, along with others in Calliphorinae, are part of the broader Calliphoridae family, commonly known as blow flies or bottle flies, which are often associated with carrion, decaying organic matter, or plant material as larval food sources. However, specific ecological roles within Calliphorinae may vary depending on the presence or absence of larval pharyngeal appendages, which could influence feeding behaviors or habitat preferences.  \n\nBy integrating the defining adult traits (arc-shaped wing veins and telescopic ovipositor) with the variable larval features (pharyngeal appendage presence), Calliphorinae represents a taxonomically distinct yet ecologically diverse group within the Calliphoridae. Its members contribute to decomposition processes and are subjects of interest in forensic entomology and ecological studies. The inclusion of both fixed and variable characteristics underscores the importance of comprehensive morphological analysis in classifying and understanding this subfamily.\",2\n3695,HYPOPYGIOPSIS INFUMATA,,4\n3563,LUCILIA,\"Lucilia is a genus of flies within the tribe Luciliini, characterized by metallic green body coloration and specific morphological features such as long plumose antennae and a 1/3 cheek height to eye height ratio.
