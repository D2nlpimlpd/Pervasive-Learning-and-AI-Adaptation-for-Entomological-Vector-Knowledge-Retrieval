Researchers like Kato (1950) and Suwa (1974) have contributed to understanding species such as *Chionomyia vetula* and *Pegohylemyia*. Some species, like *Lixophaga parva*, were introduced for pest control, while others, such as *Stomoxys uruma* (type locality in Ryukyu Islands), are native.

While the primary focus of Yonaguni’s ecological significance lies in its marine and terrestrial ecosystems, the distribution of *Musca sorbens* highlights the island’s role in supporting specific insect populations.
