BOT. AFR.\"\") is a multidisciplinary scientific publication focused on African zoology and botany. It has served as a platform for describing new species and documenting biodiversity in the African region. Two notable species have been introduced in this journal: *Alikangiella flava*, a taxon described by Villeneuve in 1927, and *Isomyia electa*, another species whose description was also published in the journal, though the specific author and year for *Isomyia electa* are not provided in the data. The journal’s role in taxonomic research is evident through its contributions to entomology and mycology, as both species belong to distinct biological groups—*Alikangiella flava* is a fungal species, while *Isomyia electa* is a dipteran insect. The absence of conflicting information in the descriptions allows for a unified summary, highlighting the journal’s significance in advancing knowledge of African flora and fauna. Its historical use by researchers like Villeneuve underscores its credibility as a source for taxonomic studies. The journal continues to be a reference for scientists working on African ecosystems, providing a repository for discoveries in zoological and botanical sciences. Both *Alikangiella flava* and *Isomyia electa* exemplify the diverse life forms documented in this publication, reflecting its broad scope and commitment to regional biodiversity research.\",2\n3927,GYMNADICHOSIA PUSILLA,,16\n2520,VILLENEUVE,\"\n\n**Villeneuve** was a notable entomologist and taxonomist who made significant contributions to the classification of various insect species and genera during the early 20th century. His work spanned multiple taxonomic groups, with descriptions published between 1911 and 1933. In 1911, Villeneuve described the genus *Microceromasia* and the species *Blaesoxipha litoralis*. The same year also marked his involvement in the taxonomy of *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, a species later reclassified under the subgenus *Bufolucilia*. In 1925, he formally described the species *Atherigona reversura*, adding to the understanding of flies in the family Muscidae. By 1927, Villeneuve established the genus *Gymnadichosia*, which he expanded in 1933 with the description of the species *Gymnadichosia pusilla*. Additionally, he is credited as the author of the species *Hoplocephala linearis* and the genus *Wohlfahrtiodes*, though the exact year for these contributions is unspecified in the provided data. Villeneuve’s work reflects a focus on dipteran insects, particularly in defining new genera and species, and his publications remain foundational in entomological taxonomy. His career highlights include pioneering descriptions that clarified the relationships and classifications of these taxa, contributing to the broader field of insect systematics. The consistency in his naming conventions and the chronological progression of his publications suggest a dedicated and methodical approach to taxonomic research. Villeneuve’s legacy is preserved in the scientific literature through the species and genera he established, which continue to be referenced in modern entomology.\",14\n4305,台湾等彩蝇,\"A species of fly in the genus Isomyia, described by Villeneuve in 1927, with a body length of 8-11 mm and a distribution in Sichuan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Taiwan (Kaohsiung Jiasianpu, the type locality), Hainan, Japan, Nepal, Myanmar, Malaya, and India\",15\n3707,裸变丽蝇属,\"裸变丽蝇属 (Gymnadichosia) is a genus of flies with sparse or absent eye hairs, specific wing and abdominal bristle patterns, and distinct male and female reproductive structures.

It is recognized as the publication where the species *Blaesoxipha litoralis* was first described in 1911. The journal serves as a key resource for entomological research and has contributed to the documentation of various insect species through its scholarly articles. The use of the abbreviation \"\"Deuts,ent.Zeits.\"\" is common in scientific literature to reference this periodical efficiently. The specific mention of 1911 in the second description aligns with the first, confirming the year of the initial description of *Blaesoxipha litoralis* in this journal. Together, these details establish *Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift* as both the authoritative German journal in entomology and the historical source for the taxonomic introduction of *Blaesoxipha litoralis*. The entity’s role in entomological science is underscored by its long-standing reputation for publishing rigorous research, including foundational works like the 1911 description of this species.
