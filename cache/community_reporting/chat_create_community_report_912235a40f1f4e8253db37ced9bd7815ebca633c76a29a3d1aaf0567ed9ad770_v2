It is recognized as a potential type locality for the species *Egle minuta*, indicating its historical or scientific significance in the context of this organism's classification or discovery. The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the geographic location where a species is first identified and described, serving as a reference point for its taxonomic record. While the exact role of Aachen in relation to *Egle minuta* remains unspecified in the provided descriptions, its mention in this capacity suggests a connection to biological or geological studies conducted in the region. Additionally, Aachen is broadly cited as a location in the text, though the specific context or purpose of this reference is not detailed. As a real-world city, Aachen is known for its rich history, Roman heritage, and proximity to the borders of Belgium and the Netherlands. The combination of its geographical identity and its potential scientific relevance to *Egle minuta* underscores its dual significance as both a cultural and possibly a research-related site.
