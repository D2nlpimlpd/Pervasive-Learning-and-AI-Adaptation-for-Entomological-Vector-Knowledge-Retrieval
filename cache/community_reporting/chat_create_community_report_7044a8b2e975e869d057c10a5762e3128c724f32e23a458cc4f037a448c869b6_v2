The region also hosts *Meigenia grandigena*, *Meigenia majuscula*, and *Medina collaris*, alongside the *1431家蚕追寄蝇* (domestic silkworm tachinid fly) and *614裸蹠芒蝇* (naked tarsal芒蝇).

Collectively, the descriptions underscore Madagascar’s role as a critical area for the study and conservation of fly species, particularly those with specialized ecological functions such as parasitism. The island’s distinct ecosystems, ranging from rainforests to arid regions, likely contribute to the diversity and distribution of these organisms. While the term \"\"foreign region\"\" in the first description may reflect a perspective from outside Madagascar, the summaries consistently align with its identity as a sovereign country and a biologically rich location. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all references to Madagascar as a distribution site for these species are harmonized within the context of its geographic and ecological uniqueness.
