In 1928, Seguy described the species *Chrysomya phaonis* and *Polleniopsis mongolica*, and was linked to the genus *Cyaneosomyia*. The same year, he also documented *Strongyloneura senomera*, though the exact publication date for this species is unspecified in the data. By 1934, Seguy expanded his work by contributing to the *Encyclopaedia Entomologica* (Enc. Ent), a significant reference in entomology, and described several species, including *Bellardia menechma*, *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) idmais*, and *Sarcophaga hervebazini*. Additionally, he documented *Chirosia alutia* and *Strongyloneura senomera* in this period, though the latter’s 1934 attribution may overlap with earlier work. In 1941, Seguy conducted a detailed study on the larval development of *Macronychia polyodon* within Hymenoptera nests, highlighting his focus on developmental biology alongside taxonomy. His research also extended to geographic distribution, as he is cited in records of species found in Syria and Laos. Seguy’s work spans multiple genera and species, including *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) idmais*, which reflects taxonomic revisions over time. His contributions to the 1930s-era *Encyclopaedia Entomologica* further solidify his role in documenting and classifying insect species during a critical period of entomological research. Overall, Seguy’s legacy includes foundational descriptions of Diptera species, insights into larval ecology, and geographic data that remain relevant in modern entomological studies.\",25\n3819,BELLARDIA MENECHMA,\"A species of fly described by Seguy in 1934, characterized by larval development and specific morphological features such as 1:1 abdominal tergite setae and dark brown to black anterior spiracles\",7\n5334,巧亚麻蝇PARASARCOPHAGA (LIOSARCOPHAGA) IDMAIS,\"A species of fly described by Seguy in 1934, with morphological features including a broad anal tail leaf and distribution in Chinese provinces and internationally in Thailand and Nepal\",2\n6209,CHRYSOYA PHAONIS,Scientific name of a fly species described by Seguy in 1928,2\n4953,ENT.
