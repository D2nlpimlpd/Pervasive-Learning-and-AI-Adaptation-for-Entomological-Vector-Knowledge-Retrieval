He described several notable species, including *Parasarcophaga uliginosa* in 1908, a member of the family Sarcophagidae (flesh flies), and *Sarcophaga schuetzei* in 1909, another sarcophagid fly species. In the same year (1908), he also established the genus *Pseudosarcophaga*, which is closely related to *Parasarcophaga*. Additionally, Kramer authored the 1911 description of *Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia*, a species within the family Syrphidae (hoverflies), with the \"\"(D.)\"\" likely denoting a subgenus or taxonomic subgroup.  \n\nKramer is further credited with describing the genus *Pierretia*, though the specific year for this contribution is not explicitly stated in the provided data. His work on these taxa reflects a focus on diverse fly families, including Sarcophagidae and Syrphidae, as well as broader taxonomic efforts in entomology.  \n\nA potential point of clarification arises from the description of *毛腹绿蝇* (Lucilia sericata, a species of blow fly) as \"\"nec Kramer, 1910.\"\" The Latin abbreviation \"\"nec\"\" indicates that Kramer was not the original author of this species, which was first described in 1910 by another researcher. However, Kramer may have been associated with the species through subsequent studies, revisions, or nomenclatural corrections, as suggested by the phrasing. This distinction is critical in taxonomic literature to avoid misattribution.  \n\nIn summary, Kramer’s legacy includes the formal description of *Parasarcophaga uliginosa* (1908), *Pseudosarcophaga* (1908), *Sarcophaga schuetzei* (1909), *Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia* (1911), and the genus *Pierretia*. His work advanced the understanding of dipteran taxonomy, though his role in the 1910 description of *Lucilia sericata* remains corrected to another author. These contributions highlight his expertise in classifying both sarcophagid and syrphid flies, as well as his engagement with broader entomological research.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",4\n5320,JAPAN (AGAIN),Country where Parasarcophaga uliginosa is found,1\n5321,SOVIET UNION (AGAIN),Country where Parasarcophaga uliginosa is found,1\n5229,伪叉麻蝇,伪叉麻蝇 (Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia) 是一种寄生在僧尼舞毒娥幼虫中的肉食性蝇类，由 Kramer 于 1911 年描述，分布于中国黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、河北，以及朝鲜、日本（北海道）、苏联和德国（模式产地）,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10212,PARASARCOPHAGA ULIGINOSA,KRAMER,Kramer described the species Parasarcophaga uliginosa in 1908,18\n10214,PARASARCOPHAGA ULIGINOSA,JAPAN (AGAIN),Parasarcophaga uliginosa is found in Japan,15\n10215,PARASARCOPHAGA ULIGINOSA,SOVIET UNION (AGAIN),Parasarcophaga uliginosa is found in the Soviet Union,15\n9325,KRAMER,ENT.
