It has documented numerous species across diverse fly families, including parasitic flies, and is recognized for its contributions to entomological science in China. The journal has published descriptions of species such as *Egle rectapica* and *Egle cyrtapica*, as well as *Protomiltogramma yunnanense* (described in issue 24(3):314, figures 5–10, under the genus *Pterella*). It has also featured studies on parasitic flies like *Blepharipa tibialis* and *Drymeia xinjiangensis*, alongside *Xestomyia hirtifemur*. \n\nTaxonomic work on the genus *Pegomya* is prominently highlighted, with the journal publishing descriptions of *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Pegomya hamatacrophalla*, *Pegomya angusticerca*, *Pegomya simpliciforceps*, *Pegomya flaviprecoxa*, *Pegomya dichaetomyiola*, *Pegomya folifera*, *Pegomya melatrochanter*, *Pegomya crinisternita*, and *Pegomya tenuiramula*. For the genus *Phaonia*, it has documented species such as *Phaonia bitrigona*, *Phaonia nigrigenis*, *Phaonia qingheensis*, and *Phaonia fissa*, with specific mentions of *Phaonia huanrenensis* described in 1984. The journal also includes studies on *Bellardia* species, such as *Bellardia micromenechma* and *Bellardia notomenechma* (described in 1986 by Liang and Gan), and *Servillia planiforceps*. \n\nAdditional species documented in the journal include *Heteronychia macromembrana* (1980), *Syllegopterula flava* (with a reference correction to remove an extraneous parenthesis), *Dinemomyia nigribasicosta* (described by Chen in 1975), and *1355 Small Gray Pierretia Fly*. It has also published works on *Alliopsis* species, *1278靴折麻蝇* (Servaisia species in issue 21(2):185), and *1966 study on fly larvae* by Meng Xianqin. The journal’s 1981 issue (volume 24, issue 3, pages 314–315) includes the description of *Tibetan Tuberomembrana*, and it has been a venue for documenting new *Helina* species and their Chinese distributions. \n\nThe journal is written in Chinese (its full title is *昆虫学报*) and has been cited in multiple contexts, including taxonomic classifications and ecological research. Its publications span decades, with notable contributions in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and it continues to serve as a critical resource for entomologists studying Chinese insect biodiversity. The journal’s role in describing and classifying species like *Burmanomyia beesoni* and *Atherigona* (e.g., pages 4(1–2):8–9, figures 1–5, 6–10, 21–26, 32–36) further underscores its importance in regional entomology. \n\nIn summary, *Acta Entomologica Sinica* is a multidisciplinary Chinese journal that has systematically advanced the understanding of fly taxonomy, ecology, and distribution, with a focus on species native to China. It has been instrumental in publishing works by researchers such as Liang, Gan, Hsue, and Chen, and remains a foundational reference for studies on genera like *Pegomya*, *Phaonia*, *Bellardia*, and others. The journal’s historical and ongoing contributions to entomology are marked by detailed morphological descriptions, distribution data, and taxonomic revisions, making it a vital resource for the scientific community. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",66\n1373,ALLIOPSIS LATIFRONS,\"Species described by Fan et Wu in 1983, found in Tibet\",2\n1374,ALLIOPSIS HETEROCHAETA,\"Species described by Fan et Wu in 1983, found in Tibet\",2\n1375,ALLIOPSIS DENTILAMELLA,\"Species described by Fan et Wu in 1983, found in Tibet\",2\n1376,ALLIOPSIS VENTIPALMATA,\"Species described by Fan et Wu in 1983, found in Tibet\",2\n6211,MENG XIANQIN,Author of a 1966 article in Acta Entomologica Sinica about fly larvae,1\n3531,HUANREN SHAJIANZI,\"Huanren Shajianzi is a location in Liaoning province, the type locality for Phaonia fissa\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9159,TIBETAN TUBEROMEMBRANA,FAN,Fan described the Tibetan Tuberomembrana species in 1981,298\n6500,LIAONING,PUBLICATION IN ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA 27(3):337,The publication event is associated with Phaonia fissa found in Liaoning,228\n11042,HEILONGJIANG,BLEPHARIPA TIBIALIS,Blepharipa tibialis is distributed in Heilongjiang province,200\n640,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,EGLE RECTAPICA,The journal Acta Entomologica Sinica describes Egle rectapica,72\n2085,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,ALLIOPSIS LATIFRONS,Species Alliopsis latifrons was published in Acta Entomologica Sinica,68\n2086,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,ALLIOPSIS HETEROCHAETA,Species Alliopsis heterochaeta was published in Acta Entomologica Sinica,68\n2087,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,ALLIOPSIS DENTILAMELLA,Species Alliopsis dentilamella was published in Acta Entomologica Sinica,68\n2088,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,ALLIOPSIS VENTIPALMATA,Species Alliopsis ventripalmata was published in Acta Entomologica Sinica,68\n11996,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,MENG XIANQIN,Meng Xianqin published a 1966 study in Acta Entomologica Sinica,67\n6504,HUANREN SHAJIANZI,PUBLICATION IN ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA 27(3):337,The publication event is associated with Phaonia fissa from Huanren Shajianzi,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
