The region is also home to *Tachina albidopilosa* and *T. nupta*, with the latter noted in the northern Greater Khingan Range. \n\nInner Mongolia hosts multiple species of the genera *Phaonia* (e.g., *P. jagedaqiensis*, *P. malaisei*, *P. changbaishanensis*, *P. beizhenesis*), *Miltogrammoides* (e.g., *M. zimini*), and *Strobilomyia* (e.g., *S. melaniola*, *S. laricicola* in Ganhe and Guxuan). Specific localities within the region, such as Hohhot (including Dagao Mountain and Naoxintai), Hulunbeier League, Alashan Banner, Ejina Banner, Dongwuqi, and Jiagedaqi, are highlighted for species like *Oestromyia tarandi*, *Shuangban Jiewei Jiying*, *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, and *Muscina assimilis*. The western Gobi Desert is noted for *Agriella gobica*, while the southeastern part (Naoxintai) supports *Calliphora genarum*. \n\nAdditional species documented in Inner Mongolia include *1238黑条蝇* (Black-streaked Fly 1238), *细角细麻蝇* (Fine-horned Small Tachinid Fly), *1254钝叶污蝇* and *1256黑须污蝇* (Blunt-leaf and Black-whiskered Filth Flies), *异聚蜂麻蝇*, *多斑聚蜂麻蝇*, and *华丽聚蜂麻蝇* (Distinctive, Multispotted, and Ornate Tachinid Flies), as well as *肖瘤胫厕蝇* and *毛踝厕蝇* (Rhinus-legged and Hairy Ankle厕 Flies). The region is also a type locality for *1341细角细麻蝇* (Fine-horned Small Tachinid Fly 1341) and *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia*. \n\nInner Mongolia’s ecological significance is underscored by its role in studies of fly-host relationships and outbreaks, such as those involving *Prosena* and *Brush Spring Fly*. It supports genera like *Zaira*, *Meigenia*, *Hydrophoria* (e.g., *H. melaena*, *H. wierzejskii*), *Dasyphora* (e.g., *D. trichosterna*, *D. asiatica*), and *Paraprosalpia* (e.g., *P. atrifimbriae*). Species such as *Muscina sorbens*, *Musca bezzii*, *Musca tempestiva*, *Musca conducens*, and *Muscina larvarum* are also reported, alongside *Voria ruralis* and *Cuphocera varia*. \n\nThe region’s biodiversity includes rare or regionally significant species like *KENT’S SARCOPHAGA*, *SHUANG YANGYING*, *1281毛股折麻蝇* (Hairy-thighed Folded Tachinid Fly), *Azelia fengi*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Helicophagella maculata*, and *Leucophora unilineata*. Notably, *Miltogramma bimaculatum* and *M. tibitum*, as well as *Hydrotaea armipes* and *Calliphora axata* (Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner), are documented. Inner Mongolia is further recognized for its role in the distribution of *Jining*, *Tumertei*, *Linhe*, and *Siziwang Banner* as specific fly habitats. \n\nThis summary consolidates Inner Mongolia’s status as a critical area for entomological research, emphasizing its role in the domestic and regional ecology of over 50 fly species across diverse genera and habitats.

Additionally, the species *Halina moedlingensis* is noted as being distributed in Poland, though this may represent a typographical variation of *Helina* (a genus in the family Muscidae) and requires further clarification. The country also hosts *Coenosia octopunctata* and *Coenosia flavicornis*, both members of the *Coenosia* genus, as well as *Haematobia titillans* (the horn fly) and *Musca larvipara* (a species of housefly). *Pollenia pectinata*, a blow fly, is similarly reported in Poland. The genus *Sinonipponia*, though less commonly referenced, is also documented as occurring in the region. Furthermore, the genus *Helicophagella* is described as being distributed in Poland, though the term \"\"foreign country\"\" in this context may be an error, as all other descriptions explicitly reference Poland as the location. Finally, the data highlights that Poland is a country where at least one species exhibits international distribution, though the specific species is not named. These findings underscore Poland’s ecological significance as a habitat for both native and internationally distributed insect taxa, contributing to broader biodiversity studies in Europe. The summary consolidates all provided information, resolving potential typographical inconsistencies (e.g., \"\"Halina\"\" likely intended as *Helina*) and emphasizing the country’s role in the geographic range of these species.
