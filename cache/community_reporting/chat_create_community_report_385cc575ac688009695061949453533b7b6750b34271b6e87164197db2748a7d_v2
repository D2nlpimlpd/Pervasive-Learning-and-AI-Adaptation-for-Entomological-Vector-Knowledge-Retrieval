Additionally, the species *Halina moedlingensis* is noted as being distributed in Poland, though this may represent a typographical variation of *Helina* (a genus in the family Muscidae) and requires further clarification. The country also hosts *Coenosia octopunctata* and *Coenosia flavicornis*, both members of the *Coenosia* genus, as well as *Haematobia titillans* (the horn fly) and *Musca larvipara* (a species of housefly). *Pollenia pectinata*, a blow fly, is similarly reported in Poland.
