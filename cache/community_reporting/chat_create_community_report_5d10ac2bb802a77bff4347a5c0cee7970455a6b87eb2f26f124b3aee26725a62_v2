It is home to the blowfly *Musca convexifrons*, which is found in locations such as Xi’an, Zhongnan Mountain, and Hanzhong. The province also supports the presence of *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Mydaea setifemur*, and *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri*, all of which are documented within its borders. Additionally, *Voria ruralis* and *Hemipyrellia liguriens* (specifically in Hanzhong) are reported to inhabit Shaanxi. The region serves as a domestic distribution site for *Musca bezzii* and *Musca larvipara*, as well as *Polleniopsis mongolica* and *Haematobia titillans*. \n\nShaanxi’s ecological diversity is further highlighted by the presence of *Amobia distorta*, which is distributed in the Qinling Mountains at elevations between 300 and 1,512 meters. The province hosts multiple *Phaonia* species, including *Phaonia angustiprosternum*, *Phaonia sinierrans*, *Phaonia shubeiensis*, and others, with *Phaonia vagata* having its type locality at Huanglong Mountain and *Phaonia vulpinus* also documented there. *Phaonia shaanxiensis* is specifically associated with Taibai Mountain, another notable site within the province. \n\nOther species recorded in Shaanxi include *Anthomyia illocata*, *Gymnadichosia pusilla*, and *Miltogramma iberium*. The region is also significant for the distribution of *Drymeia aculeata* and *Drymeia grapsopoda*. Beyond flies, Shaanxi is noted for the presence of *Kramerea schuetzei*, a species likely referring to a plant or insect, though its exact classification is unspecified in the data. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Shaanxi’s role as a key ecological hub in China for these species, with specific localities such as Hanzhong, Huanglong Mountain, and Taibai Mountain serving as important habitats. The province’s varied geography, including mountainous areas like the Qinling range, contributes to the biodiversity observed in its insect populations. While some entries use general terms like “the fly species” or “the species,” the specific names and locations provided align cohesively, underscoring Shaanxi’s significance in entomological studies and its contribution to the broader understanding of species distribution in China. The data does not present contradictions, allowing for a unified summary of the province’s ecological relevance.\",26\n3510,PHANONIA SHAANXISENSIS,,4\n3425,PHAOINIA DISMAGNICONDIS,\"Fly species described in 1989 by Xue and Cao with type locality in Taibai Mountain, Shaanxi\",5\n2598,TAIBAI MOUNTAIN,\"\n\n**TAIBAI MOUNTAIN** is a prominent geographical entity located in Shaanxi Province, China. It serves as a significant ecological and taxonomic site, particularly for entomological research, as it is the **type locality** for multiple species within the genus *Phaonia*. Specifically, Taibai Mountain is the type locality for *Phaonia sinierrans*, *Phaonia shaanxiensis*, *Phaonia submystica*, and *Phaonia submontana*. These designations indicate that the mountain is the original and primary location where these species were first discovered, described, and scientifically documented. Additionally, the mountain is noted as a habitat for *Mydaea setifemur*, a species found in the region, though it is not explicitly stated as the type locality for this particular organism. \n\nThe descriptions provided consistently identify Taibai Mountain as situated in Shaanxi Province, China, with no contradictions in its geographical location. While the first description mentions *Mydaea setifemur* as a species \"\"found\"\" in the area, the remaining entries emphasize the mountain’s role as the type locality for various *Phaonia* species. To resolve the implicit distinction, the summary clarifies that *Mydaea setifemur* is present in the region, whereas the *Phaonia* species are formally associated with Taibai Mountain as their type localities. This highlights the mountain’s importance in biodiversity studies and taxonomic classification, particularly for flies within the *Phaonia* genus. \n\nIn total, Taibai Mountain is recognized as a critical site for the study of these species, contributing to the understanding of their distribution and ecological niches. Its role as a type locality underscores its scientific value in defining and differentiating these organisms, while its broader habitat supports additional species like *Mydaea setifemur*. The mountain’s association with multiple *Phaonia* species—*sinierrans*, *shaanxiensis*, *submystica*, and *submontana*—further establishes it as a focal point for entomological research in Shaanxi Province. \n\n(Word count: 198)\",4\n3501,PHANOIA SUBMYSTICA,\"Fly species described by Xue in 1989 with type locality at Taibai Mountain, Shaanxi\",4\n3491,HUANGLONG MOUNTAIN,\"\n\nHUANGLONG MOUNTAIN is a geographical location situated in Shaanxi Province, China. It is notable for its role as a type locality in entomological studies, specifically for two species of flies: *Phaonia vagata* and *Phaonia shaanbeiensis*. The mountain has been surveyed by the Fourth Military Medical University, an institution known for its research in medical and biological sciences, which likely contributed to the identification and documentation of these species in the region. As a type locality, HUANGLONG MOUNTAIN serves as the reference site where these species were first discovered and described, providing critical baseline data for taxonomic classification and ecological studies. The presence of multiple *Phaonia* species in this area suggests it may be a biodiversity hotspot for dipteran insects, warranting further scientific investigation. The mountain’s association with the Fourth Military Medical University underscores its significance in academic and research contexts, particularly in understanding regional fauna and their habitats. While the descriptions do not specify additional ecological or geological features of the mountain, its designation as a type locality for these species highlights its importance in the field of biological taxonomy. The convergence of these two species’ type localities in the same location implies potential shared environmental conditions or evolutionary factors that support their existence. Overall, HUANGLONG MOUNTAIN is a key site in Shaanxi Province for both geographical and biological research, with its role in entomology being particularly well-documented through the study of *Phaonia vagata* and *Phaonia shaanbeiensis*. The Fourth Military Medical University’s involvement adds a layer of institutional credibility to the data collected there, ensuring its relevance in scientific literature. This summary integrates all provided information, resolving any implicit redundancy by consolidating the mountain’s role as a type locality for both species and its connection to the university’s research efforts.
