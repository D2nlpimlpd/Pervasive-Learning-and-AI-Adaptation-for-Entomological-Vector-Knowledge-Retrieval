The provided descriptions both associate Rognes with this taxonomic work, highlighting their role in the scientific classification of the species. As an expert in the study of insects, Rognes' contribution to the field of entomology includes the formal description and naming of *Pollenia pseudo rudis*, which was published in that year. This work is part of the broader effort to document and categorize insect biodiversity, and Rognes' expertise in this area is recognized through their publication. The descriptions are consistent, with no contradictions to resolve, allowing for a unified account of Rognes' academic achievement in 1985. Their research on *Pollenia pseudo rudis* likely involved detailed morphological analysis and ecological observations, as is standard in entomological taxonomy. The species *Pollenia pseudo rudis* belongs to the family Polleniidae, a group of flies commonly known as rat-tailed maggots, though specific details about the species' characteristics or habitat are not included in the provided data. Rognes' work in 1985 remains a key reference for studies involving this species, underscoring their impact on the classification of Diptera.
