As an author, Collin first described *Leucophora personata* in 1921, establishing its scientific recognition. In 1926, Collin also described the species *密毛绿蝇* (Lucilia richardsi Collin, 1926), a member of the genus *Lucilia*. By 1935, Collin had contributed to broader taxonomic classifications within the field, demonstrating expertise in systematic entomology. The following year, in 1936, Collin described *Subhylemyia lineola*, further expanding their work on fly taxonomy. In 1939, Collin authored the description of *Ringdahlana Fannia*, a species in the genus *Fannia*. Decades later, in 1967, Collin described *海岸泉种蝇* (Pegohylemyia oraria), a species within the genus *Pegohylemyia*. Additionally, Collin is credited with describing *舌叶厕蝇*, though the scientific name for this species is not explicitly provided in the data. Collectively, these contributions highlight Collin’s role in documenting and categorizing diverse fly species across multiple genera, including *Leucophora*, *Lucilia*, *Subhylemyia*, *Fannia*, and *Pegohylemyia*. Their work spans over four decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and reflects a sustained engagement with entomological research. While some species are associated with Chinese common names (e.g., *密毛绿蝇*, *海岸泉种蝇*, *舌叶厕蝇*), the scientific nomenclature provided underscores Collin’s adherence to formal taxonomic practices. The descriptions of *Leucophora personata* and *Lucilia richardsi* are explicitly linked to Collin’s authorship in 1921 and 1926, respectively, with no conflicting dates or attributions in the data. Overall, Collin’s legacy lies in their meticulous documentation of fly biodiversity, advancing the understanding of these insects through both specific species descriptions and general taxonomic frameworks.\",7\n1058,SUBHYLEMIIA LINEOLA,\"Subhylemyia lineola is a species of fly in the subgenus Deliomyia, distinguished by its elongated aedeagus and distributed in Qinghai and Inner Mongolia\",4\n1065,TRANS ENT SOC LONDON,Publication by Collin in 1920 describing Leucophora personata,1\n1583,舌叶厕蝇,舌叶厕蝇 (Fannia ringdahlana Collin) is a species of fly described by Collin.
