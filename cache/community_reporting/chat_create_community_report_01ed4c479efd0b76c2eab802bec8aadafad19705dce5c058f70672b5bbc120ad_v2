It is home to the genus *Helina* (球麻蝇属), with species such as *Helina lateralis* and *Helina nemorum* found internationally within its borders. The country also hosts the species *Dichaetomyia bibax*, *Lucilia shenyangensis*, and *Isomyia pseudonepalana*, as well as the genus *Harpagophalla*, specifically *Harpagophalla kempi*. Notably, *Polietes hirticrura* is distributed in India, with its type locality identified as Darjeeling in the Himalayan region. \n\nIndia serves as a native or foreign distribution location for several other species. For instance, *Musca ventrosa* and *Musca vitripennis* (houseflies) are present in the country, while *Atherigona soccata* (a fruit fly) is also documented there. The species *Phaenicia simulans* (Mall.) (likely a blowfly) is reported to inhabit India, as are the *Meng* genus species *Meng lateralis*, *Meng zhejiangensis*, and *Meng annulipes*. Additionally, the botfly *Oestrus caerulescens* (紫鼻狂蝇) is noted to have a foreign distribution in India, specifically in the Punjab province. \n\nThe country is further associated with the distribution of *Delia echinata*, a non-native species, and the *Muscina* genus, which includes *Muscina sordida* (污瓣莫蝇) and *Muscina nigripes* (黑瓣莫蝇). These findings highlight India's ecological role in supporting both indigenous and introduced fly populations. The presence of such a wide range of species underscores the region's biodiversity and its importance in entomological studies. \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to India as a \"\"foreign distribution location,\"\" this likely reflects the introduction of certain species beyond their original ranges, whereas others are native to the subcontinent. The data collectively emphasize India's position as a key area for the study of fly ecology, with specific regional references like Darjeeling and Punjab adding geographic context to species' habitats. This synthesis integrates all provided information into a cohesive overview of India's entomological significance. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",18\n3074,\"SUPPLTA.

It is home to multiple **Dichaetomyia** species, as well as the **Harpagophalla kempi** and **Atherigona soccata** species, which are part of its ecological biodiversity. The country also hosts **Helina lateralis** and **Helina nemorum**, both of which are found internationally, with Myanmar contributing to their global range. Additionally, **Isomyia pseudonepalana** and **Musca ventrosa** are documented as part of Myanmar’s fauna, further highlighting its role in supporting various fly species. \n\nMyanmar is a key location for the **Polietes hirticrura** species, which is distributed across its territory. The country serves as a distribution area for **海南莫蝇** (likely *Hainan Mopheila*, though the exact scientific name may require verification) and **Pyrrellia cyanicolor**, both of which are associated with its ecosystems. Furthermore, **Ph. simulans Mall.** (possibly *Phaenicia simulans* or a similar species) is explicitly noted as a species distributed in Myanmar. \n\nA unique ecological role is attributed to Myanmar as the **source country for the introduction of the Asian elephant stomach botfly** (*Gasterophilus elephantis*), a parasitic fly affecting elephants. This underscores its importance in the context of wildlife health and conservation in the region. The country is also described as a **\"\"foreign country in the distribution of some species\"\"**, likely referring to its status as an external range for species native to other areas, though specific examples are not provided in the data. \n\nIn summary, Myanmar’s geographical and ecological diversity supports the distribution of numerous fly species, including both regionally and globally significant ones. Its role as a habitat for these species, as well as a source for the Asian elephant stomach botfly, positions it as a critical area for entomological and ecological studies. The listed species reflect a mix of local and international distributions, emphasizing Myanmar’s interconnectedness with broader biodiversity networks. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",11\n2017,海南莫蝇,\"海南莫蝇 (Morellia hainanensis) is a species described by Ni, with a distribution in China and other regions like Myanmar, India, and Thailand.\",5\n3273,马来亚,Ph.glauca Malloch的分布地,2\n3292,PH.GLAUCA MALLOCH,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5511,印度,\"TIJDSCHR.ENT,, 47: 105(♀)(SPILOGASTER)\",This publication describes a species found in India,27\n5502,台湾,\"SUPPLTA.
