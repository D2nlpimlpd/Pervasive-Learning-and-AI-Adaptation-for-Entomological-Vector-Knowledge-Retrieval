Members of this genus are notable for their elongated third antennal segments, which reach or nearly reach the mouth margin, a feature emphasized in multiple descriptions. Their eye structures are also distinctive, narrowing downward with the lower half often exhibiting a concave shape. This eye morphology, combined with the absence of fronto-orbital bristles (a key diagnostic trait), helps distinguish *Pygophora* from other genera in the family. In males, an additional feature is the presence of a terminal ventral process on the tibia, though this is not universally observed across all species. The descriptions collectively confirm that *Pygophora* is defined by both shared and sex-specific characteristics, with the elongated antennae and specialized eye structures being consistent across the genus. These traits align with its placement in the Coenosiini tribe, a group within the Muscidae family known for diverse morphological adaptations.

He is the author of the genus *Pygophora*, which he described in 1868, and also documented the species *Rhychomyia aberrans* in the same year. Additionally, SCHINER described *Atherigona (Acritochaeta) orientalis* in 1868, a species later reclassified under the subgenus *Acritochaeta* within the genus *Atherigona*. His work in 1861 further established the genus *Pharyngomyia* and the subgenus *Paragusia*, the latter of which he defined as a taxonomic subgroup within *Atherigona*. These contributions highlight his role in systematizing and expanding the classification of dipteran species during the mid-1800s. SCHINER’s research, though focused on specific genera and species, reflects a broader engagement with the morphological and ecological diversity of flies, providing foundational references for subsequent studies in the field. His descriptions, published in the 1860s, remain critical to understanding the historical development of entomological taxonomy and the relationships among these groups. Notably, the subgenus *Paragusia* and the genus *Pharyngomyia* predate his 1868 works, underscoring his sustained scholarly activity over the decade. SCHINER’s legacy is preserved in the continued use of these taxonomic names, which are cited in modern scientific literature to trace the evolutionary and ecological contexts of the species he documented. His efforts in 1861 and 1868 collectively advanced the systematic study of flies, offering insights into their classification that remain relevant to contemporary researchers. By delineating distinct genera and subgenera, SCHINER helped clarify the hierarchical structure of dipteran taxonomy, contributing to the broader scientific understanding of insect biodiversity during his era.\",6\n2484,ATHERIGONA ORIENTALIS,Atherigona orientalis is a species described by Schiner in 1868,5\n2912,PYGOPHORA IMMACULIPENNIS,\"Pygophora immaculipennis is a species of fly described by Frey in 1917, with unspotted wings and specific abdominal markings.
