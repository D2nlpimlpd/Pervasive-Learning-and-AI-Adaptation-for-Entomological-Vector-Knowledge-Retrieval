The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the specific place where a species is initially documented, serving as a critical reference for its classification and identification. For *Paraprosalpia denticauda*, ZERNEST is explicitly noted as the European location associated with its type locality, while *Paraprosalpia pilitarsis* is also linked to ZERNEST as the European site from which its type specimens originated. This dual designation underscores ZERNEST's role in entomological research, particularly in the study of the *Paraprosalpia* genus, which is part of the family Tachinidae (parasitoid flies). The presence of these species in ZERNEST likely reflects the region’s ecological characteristics, such as habitat diversity or specific environmental conditions, that support their populations.

His work spanned multiple decades, with key descriptions of species appearing in 1838, 1844, 1845, and 1860. Zetterstedt first described *Pegohylemyia latifrons* in 1845, as well as *Mesembrina intermedia* in the same year. In 1838, he documented several species, including *Chionomyia vetula* (originally named *Anthomyza vetula*), *Paraprosalpia denticauda*, *Aricia hirtula* (now *Aricia hirtula*), *Tachina scutellata*, *Phorbia curvicauda*, *Pseudocoenosia solitaria*, *Sociella Fannia*, *Calliphora genarum*, *Coenosia octopunctata*, *Senotainia (Sphixapata) imberbis*, *Paraprosalpia sepiella*, and *Paraprosalpia moerens*. Notably, he also described *Caricea spuria* in 1838 and *Tachina convexifrons* in 1844, the latter referenced in the description of *Elodia morio*. \n\nIn 1845, Zetterstedt’s work included *Delia florilega*, *Chirosia albitarsis*, *Eutrichota socculata*, *Fannia glaucescens*, *Fannia incisurata*, *Helina laxifrons*, *Helina flavisquama*, *Phaonia angulicornis* (published in the *Insecta Lapp.* journal), *Paraprosalpia sepiella*, *Paraprosalpia moerens*, *Aricia eriophthalma*, *Lasiomma strigilatum*, and *Lasiomma octoguttatum*. He also described the species *Hydrophoria verticina*, *Hydrophoria hyalipennis*, *Hydrophoria ignobilis*, and *Hydrophoria lineatocollis* (1838), as well as *Hydrotaea scambus*. Among his notable works is the designation of *Aricia trollii* as the type species for the genus *Chiastocheta* in 1845. Additionally, he described *Leucophora albeseens* and *Leucophora unilineata* (though the 1920 date for the latter is likely an error, as his active period was the 19th century). \n\nZetterstedt’s research extended to species with Chinese names, including *棕翅阳蝇* (1860) and *银额阳蝇* (1845), as well as *华丽聚蜂麻蝇* (1844) and *斑足莠蝇* (1845). He also contributed to the classification of *Dexiopsis lacteipennis* and *Pseudocoenosia solitaria*. His work on *Helina* species, such as *Helina longicornis* and *Helina trivittata*, is highlighted, though the 20th-century attribution for these is inconsistent with his 19th-century timeline and may reflect later taxonomic revisions. \n\nZetterstedt’s legacy includes foundational descriptions of genera and species that remain critical to modern entomology. His meticulous documentation of morphological and ecological traits, often in Swedish or Latin, has provided a basis for ongoing studies in dipteran taxonomy. Despite some discrepancies in dates (e.g., *Leucophora unilineata* in 1920), his primary contributions are firmly rooted in the 1830s–1860s, reflecting his role as a pioneering figure in the field. His work on *Paraprosalpia* species, including *Paraprosalpia billbergi* and *Paraprosalpia denticauda*, further underscores his influence on the classification of hoverflies.
