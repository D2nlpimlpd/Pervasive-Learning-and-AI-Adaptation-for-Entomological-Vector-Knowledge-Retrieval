It is home to the East China Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where a notable book on the subject was completed in October 1964. The city and its surrounding areas, including districts like Songjiang and Sheshan, host a diverse array of flies, both native and introduced. \n\nShanghai is documented as a domestic distribution location for several species, including *Atherigona reversura*, *Atherigona triglomerata* (type locality), *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca crassirostris*, *Musca sorbens*, and *Heteronychia quoi*. The genus *Pegomya* is particularly well-represented, with species such as *Pegomya pachura*, *Pegomya aurapicalis*, *Pegomya pliciforceps*, *Pegomya argacra*, and *Pegomya kiangsuensis* recorded there. Additionally, *Pegomya cunicularia* and *Fucellia apicalis* are noted in Shanghai’s domestic regions, alongside *Fucellia chinensis*. \n\nThe city is also associated with the distribution of *Enneastigma shanghaiensis*, which has its type locality in Sheshan, a subdistrict of Songjiang. Other species with Shanghai as their type locality include *Syngamoptera gigas* and *Brontaea tonitrui*. Specific locations within Shanghai, such as Songjiang Shashan, are highlighted for *Bellardia menechmoides*, while Songjiang She Mountain is linked to *Calliphora axata*. The district of Songjiang is further noted for *Musca convexifrons* and *1339上海细麻蝇* (likely *Chrysomya pinguis* or a related species). \n\nShanghai’s biodiversity includes rare or regionally significant species like *PIERRETTIA SICHOTEALINI*, *PIERRETIACRINITULA*, *Rhychomyia aberrans*, *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, *Pexopsis capitata*, and *Stomorhina obsoleta*. The city is also a domestic range for *Hoa* genus, *Winthemia*, *Goniophyto*, *Eurysthaea scutellaris*, *Caricea mikii*, *Lasiomma octoguttatum*, *Leucophora unilineata*, *Leucophora personata*, *Calythea nigricans*, *Gonia picea*, *Hydrotaea cinerea*, *Haematobia*, and *Delia antiqua*. Notably, *Delia gracilibacilla* has Shanghai as its type locality, and the city is a distribution area for *炭黑栉寄蝇Pales carbonata* (Pales carbonata) and *斑足莠蝇* (Achoetandrus rufifacies). \n\nResearch activities in Shanghai include a 1959 study on *Fannia prisca Stein* by Fan Zide and a 1960 collection of *Phormia regina* (985瓣腹绿蝇) specimens. The region is further linked to the domestic distribution of *732 HEYUAN HUI FLY* and *Shuangban Jiewei Jiying*, as well as the presence of *紫翠蝇* (likely a species of *Chrysomya* or *Lucilia*). \n\nIn summary, Shanghai’s entomological significance is underscored by its role as a type locality for multiple species, its diverse fly fauna, and its historical and ongoing contributions to scientific studies. The city’s districts, such as Songjiang and Sheshan, are critical for understanding the geographic distribution of these insects, reflecting both ecological richness and research importance in China.
