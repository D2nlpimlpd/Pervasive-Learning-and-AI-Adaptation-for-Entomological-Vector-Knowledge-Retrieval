Their work focused on fly species and larval activity, contributing to regional ecological or agricultural research. Specifically, Mu Guangsi co-authored a 1981 study on fly species in Western Liaoning, which suggests a collaborative effort in the field of entomology. Additionally, they authored a separate 1981 report dedicated to larval activity in the same area, indicating a specialized interest in the developmental stages of flies and their ecological impact. The mention of involvement in a 1981 study spanning both Hebei and Liaoning suggests their research scope extended beyond Western Liaoning, possibly examining cross-regional patterns or environmental factors affecting fly populations. While the descriptions highlight both individual authorship and collaborative efforts, the co-authorship of the fly species study in Western Liaoning aligns with the broader 1981 project that included Hebei, resolving any apparent contradiction by framing their contributions as part of a multi-regional initiative.
