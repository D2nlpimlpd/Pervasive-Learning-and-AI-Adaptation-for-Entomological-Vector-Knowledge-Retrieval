It serves as the **type locality** for two species: *Acklandia curvata*, a fly species described from this area, and *Phaonia jagedaqiensis*, though the latter’s type locality is also ambiguously cited in **Inner Mongolia** in one source, creating a contradiction. The majority of descriptions consistently associate Jiagedaqi with Heilongjiang, suggesting the Inner Mongolia reference may be an error or a separate, similarly named location.  \n\nThe city is notable for its role in the distribution of several insect species. *Delia uniseriata*, a fly species, is documented as occurring in Jiagedaqi, as is *黑尾缘花蝇* (translated as \"\"Black-tailed Margin Fly,\"\" likely *Phaonia melanura* or a related species). These associations highlight Jiagedaqi’s ecological importance as a habitat for diverse fly populations. Additionally, the presence of *Acklandia curvata* as a type locality underscores its historical significance in taxonomic research, particularly for flies in the family Muscidae.  \n\nThe conflicting mention of Inner Mongolia for *Phaonia jagedaqiensis* requires clarification. While one source attributes its type locality to Inner Mongolia, this contradicts the broader consensus linking Jiagedaqi to Heilongjiang. Given the repeated references to Heilongjiang in the data, it is more plausible that the Inner Mongolia citation is a misattribution, possibly due to a naming overlap or administrative confusion. Future studies should verify the exact location of *Phaonia jagedaqiensis*’s type locality to resolve this discrepancy.  \n\nIn summary, **JIAGE DAQI** is primarily a city in **Heilongjiang, China**, associated with the type localities of *Acklandia curvata* and *Phaonia jagedaqiensis* (with the latter’s location requiring verification), as well as the distribution of *Delia uniseriata* and *黑尾缘花蝇*. Its role in entomology reflects its biodiversity and the need for accurate geographical data in scientific classification.
