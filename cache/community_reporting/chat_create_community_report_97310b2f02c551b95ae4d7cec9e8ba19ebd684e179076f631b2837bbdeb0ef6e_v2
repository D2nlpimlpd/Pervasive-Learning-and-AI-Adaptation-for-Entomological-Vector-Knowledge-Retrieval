PONT is best known for their 1973 study on **sorghum shoot fly control**, which is frequently cited in literature related to this pest species. This study also includes descriptions of several **Atherigona** species, such as **613点芒蝇** and **614裸蹠芒蝇**, alongside contributions to the taxonomy of **Atherigona reversura**, **Atherigona oryzae**, **Atherigona kappa**, and **Atherigona phi** (described in 1981). Additionally, PONT authored the species description for **黑斑翠蝇 Neomyia (Scutellorthellia) lauta** in 1973 and inferred **Saint-Sauveur** as its type locality.  \n\nIn the 1970s, PONT documented the distribution of **Lispe leucospila** in the Soviet Union and **Caricea vernalis** in Mongolia (1986). They also contributed to the classification of **Phaonia** species, noting similarities between groups in 1970 and later reclassifying **Ph. fuscitibia** as a subspecies of **Ph. angelicae** in 1986. PONT described **Drymeia altica** (1981) and **Drymeia beelzebub**, as well as **Polietes orientalis** (1972) and **Polietes nigrolimbata** (1986). Their 1977 work documented species distribution in India and included the description of **Dasyphora kempi**, while also expressing skepticism about the identification of **污瓣莫蝇** in Taiwan.  \n\nPONT collaborated on the genus **Huckettomyia**, co-describing **Huckettomyia watanabei** in 1970 and authoring **Megophyra simpliceps**. They are cited as a reference for **European distribution data** and for describing **Atherigona triglomerata** and **Atherigona boninensis**. Their research on **Mesembrina** species further highlights their expertise in dipteran taxonomy.  \n\nThroughout their career, PONT demonstrated a focus on both ecological and taxonomic studies, with notable contributions to understanding the biology of agricultural pests like the sorghum shoot fly and the systematics of diverse fly groups. Their work remains a key source for species identification and distribution patterns in regions such as Asia, Europe, and the Soviet Union. The breadth of their publications and collaborations underscores their role as a pivotal figure in entomological research during the late 20th century.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",41\n2390,NEOMYIA INDICA,,15\n4021,\"ANN,MAG.NAT.HIST.\",\"Journal \"\"Annals and Magazine of Natural History\"\" where species descriptions were published\",5\n1833,WIEMANN,Wiedemann is the author who described the species Ophyra chalcogaster in 1824,13\n4132,PERIS,\"\n\n**PERIS** is an entomologist recognized for their significant contributions to the classification and documentation of insect species, particularly within the mid-20th century. They are cited in entomological literature as an author who described multiple species, including *Isomyia pseudoviridana* in 1952. In the same year, PERIS completed the classification work for a genus, though the specific genus is not explicitly named in the data. Additionally, they served as a co-author for the genus *Idiella* in 1952, indicating collaboration in taxonomic studies. PERIS also documented the distribution of two species, *Rhinia apicalis* in 1952 and *Stomorhina lunata* in 1956, contributing to geographic and ecological records. Their work spans at least three years (1952, 1956, and another 1952 reference, likely a duplicate), with a focus on species-level descriptions and broader taxonomic classifications. While the data does not specify the exact genera or families involved beyond *Isomyia*, *Idiella*, *Rhinia*, and *Stomorhina*, it highlights PERIS’s role in advancing entomological knowledge through detailed species accounts, collaborative genus-level research, and distributional studies. The repeated emphasis on 1952 suggests this was a particularly productive year for their taxonomic work, encompassing both standalone species descriptions and collaborative projects. PERIS’s studies on *Rhinia apicalis* and *Stomorhina lunata* further demonstrate their engagement with documenting geographic ranges, which is critical for understanding biodiversity and ecological dynamics. Overall, PERIS’s contributions reflect a multidisciplinary approach to entomology, combining systematic classification, species discovery, and ecological documentation. Their work remains foundational in the field, providing essential references for subsequent research on these taxa. The data does not clarify whether PERIS’s studies on \"\"the species\"\" in 1952, 1956, and 1952 (the latter likely a typographical repetition) refer to the same or different species, but it underscores their sustained activity in entomological research during this period. By integrating authorship of species, genus-level classifications, and distributional records, PERIS’s legacy is marked by a commitment to both taxonomic precision and ecological insight. Their 1952 publications, in particular, appear to be pivotal, as they include the description of *Isomyia pseudoviridana*, the completion of a genus classification, and co-authorship of *Idiella*, alongside earlier work on *Rhinia apicalis*. The 1956 study on *Stomorhina lunata* adds a later contribution to their portfolio, emphasizing their long-term involvement in the field. PERIS’s efforts exemplify the collaborative and cumulative nature of entomological science, where individual contributions often form part of larger taxonomic frameworks. Despite the lack of additional biographical details, their documented works establish PERIS as a key figure in mid-20th-century entomology, with a focus on dipteran or related insect groups, given the species names provided. The synthesis of these activities into a cohesive body of work highlights their role in expanding the taxonomic database and supporting ecological research through meticulous documentation.\",15\n4151,CHLORORHINIA EXEMPTA,,13\n3020,DICHAEATOMYIA MONTICOLA,,5\n3998,DEXOPOLLENIA GENICULATA,\"Species of fly described by Malloch in 1935, found in Sichuan and Yunnan\",4\n4077,CHRY SOMYA THANOMTHINI,The naming of the species *Chrysomya thanomthini* by Kurahashi et Tumrasvin in 1971,3\n1813,VIETNAM,\"\n\nVietnam, a Southeast Asian country located on the Indo-China Peninsula, is a significant region for the distribution of various fly species. It is associated with the presence of **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Austrophorocera**, **Caiusa coomani**, **Musca autumnalis**, and **Musca pilosibasis** (毛瓣家蝇), with the latter noted as having foreign distribution records in Vietnam. The country also hosts **Polleniopsis dalatensis**, for which it serves as the type locality in some references, and **Chrysomya pinguis** and **Chrysomya bezziana**. Additionally, Vietnam is a distribution site for **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**, **Achoetandrus rufifacies** (specifically in Heping), **Bengalia species**, **Ceylonomyia nigripes**, and **Ophyra spinigera**, the latter of which is found internationally within the country.  \n\nVietnam’s biodiversity includes the **greenbottle fly *Neomyia fletcheri*** and is the type locality for *Neomyia* species, indicating its role in the taxonomic origin of these flies. The genus **Onesia** and species **I. divisa** and **I. mandarina** are also documented there. Cosmina species such as **Cosmina bicolor** and **Cosmina limbipennis** are present, with the latter noted as being found internationally in Vietnam. The **THICK RING BLACK FLY** is another species with foreign distribution records in the country.  \n\nFurther, Vietnam is home to **Hemipyrellia ligurriens** and **Meigenia majuscula**, while the **Yunnan Sericomyia** (云南亚麻蝇) is reported as a foreign distribution site. The country’s ecological significance is underscored by its role as a distribution area for multiple fly genera and species, including general references to \"\"the fly species\"\" and \"\"the species\"\" being found or distributed there. Notably, Vietnam’s status as a type locality for certain species highlights its importance in entomological research.  \n\nThis summary consolidates Vietnam’s role as a key location for diverse fly species, emphasizing both its local and international ecological contributions. The repeated mentions of distribution and type locality confirm its prominence in the habitats of these insects, though specific details about interactions or ecological impacts remain unexplored in the provided data. The inclusion of both native and foreign distribution records reflects Vietnam’s position as a crossroads for fly populations, likely influenced by its tropical climate and varied ecosystems.\",20\n1138,AUSTRALIA,\"\n\nAustralia, a country and continent in the Oceania region, is home to a diverse array of species and genera, as documented in the provided data. The nation serves as a key distribution site for several notable organisms, including the **genus Neohelina**, **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Ophyra spinigera** (which is found internationally but also present in Australia), **Ophyra chalcogaster**, **Chrysomya pinguis** (with an unusual mention of the Hawaiian Islands as part of its range), and the **Illustris Greenbottle Fly**. Additionally, the **species Pygophora respondens** is specifically noted to occur on **Christmas Island**, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean.  \n\nAustralia’s biodiversity also includes the **genus Winthemia**, **Chlororhinia exempta**, **Peribaea orbata**, and **Lispe leucospila**, all of which are documented as distributed within the country. The **Paregle** genus, comprising **Paregle aterrima** and **Paregle audacula**, is similarly reported to inhabit Australian regions. Furthermore, the **Achoetandrus rufifacies** species has a **type locality** in Australia, as described by **Senior-White et al., 1940**, and **Hemipyrellia liguriens** is cited as being found in the country by the same authors.  \n\nWhile most descriptions emphasize Australia as a native or primary distribution area, some note it as a **foreign location** in the context of species like **Sarcophaga sericea**, suggesting these organisms may have been introduced or are not indigenous to the region. The inclusion of \"\"Hawaiian Islands\"\" in the distribution of **Chrysomya pinguis** appears contradictory, as Hawaii is part of the United States, not Australia. This may reflect an error in the data, but it is retained here as per the original input.  \n\nOverall, Australia’s ecological significance is underscored by its role as a habitat for both native and non-native species across various taxonomic groups. The country’s status as a continent and nation in Oceania further highlights its unique position in global biodiversity, with contributions from historical taxonomic works such as those by Senior-White et al. (1940).

Notable species documented in India include *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina cuprina*, *Sarcophaga haematodes*, *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Argyrophylax phoeda*, *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*, *Caiusa testacea*, *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, *Musca larvipara*, *Musca crassirostris*, *Haematobia titillans*, *Haematobia minuta*, *Halydaia* and *Linnaemya* species, *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, *Isomyia electa*, *Isomyia viridaurea*, *Isomyia nebulosa*, *Leucomyia cinerea* (eastern region), *Limnophora albitarsis*, *Lispe sinica*, *Metalliopsis setosa*, *Borbororhinia bivittata*, *Paradichosia scutellata* (type locality: Darjeeling), *Pegomya bicolor*, *Pegomya quadrivittata*, *Polietes orientalis* (northern regions), *Sturmiopsis inferens*, *Tainanina pilisquama*, *Neomyia* species, *Stomoxys indicus* (type locality), *Subhylemyia longula*, *Ophyra chalcogaster*, *Hydrotaea affinis* (southern region), *Lixophaga parva*, *Muscina assimilis*, *Synthesiomyia nudiseta*, *613点芒蝇*, *紫翠蝇*, *绿翠蝇*, *东方粪泉蝇*, *长板粪泉蝇* (Assam), *Adia* genus (Assam, Khasi, and Garo Hills), *Scathophaga mellipes*, *Limnophora prominens*, *Limnophora exigua*, *Limnophora fallax fallax*, *Brontaea lasiopa* (type locality), *Chlororhinia exempta* (Assam), *Caricea boops*, *Cosmina bicolor*, *Cosmina limbipennis*, *Atherigona kappa*, *Atherigona tricolorifolia* (potential geographic subspecies), *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Atherigona biseta*, *Bengalia* species, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Borbororhina bivittata*, *Rhyncomya flavibasis*, *Drino inconspicua*, *Calythea setifrons*, *Muscidae* subfamilies, and *Sarcosolomonia crinita*. Additionally, India is a foreign distribution location for *Sarcophaga misera*, *Sarcophaga sericea*, *Sarcophaga aegyptica*, and *Stomorhina* genus species. The country's ecological diversity supports these flies, with specimens collected from regions like Darjeeling, Assam, Kashmir, and the southern areas. India's role as a type locality for several species, such as *Paradichosia scutellata* (Darjeeling) and *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* (Kashmir), underscores its importance in entomological taxonomy. The presence of both native and internationally distributed species highlights India's integration into global fly biodiversity patterns. Key genera like *Musca*, *Limnophora*, and *Dichaetomyia* are particularly well-represented, with some species (e.g., *Polietes orientalis*) noted in northern regions. The Indian greenbottle fly and the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly are also documented, alongside ecological records for *Caiusa testacea*. Overall, India's varied habitats and geographic regions contribute to its status as a critical area for studying fly species distribution and taxonomy.\",90\n2221,毛瓣家蝇,,15\n2910,PYGOPHORA MACULIPENNIS,\"Pygophora maculipennis is a species of fly described by Stein in 1909, characterized by brown spots on the wing veins and yellow legs with specific bristle patterns.

His work spanned multiple genera and species, with notable first descriptions of several taxa. MALLOCH established the genus *Emmesomyia* in 1917 and later described *Cephalispa* in 1935, as well as *Rypellia* in 1931. He also introduced the genus *Xenotachina* in 1921 and the genus *Neohelina* in 1924.  \n\nAmong the species he described are *Atherigona oryzae* (1925), *Atherigona tridens* (1928), and *Atherigona simplex* (1925), as well as *Hebecnema affinis* (1921) and *Bengalia (Eubengalia) emarginata* (1927). MALLOCH was the first to document *Musca formosana* (1925), later known as the Formosan housefly, in the *Zool. Anz. (Leipzig)* journal. He also described *Isomyia cupreoviridis* (1928) in *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.*, *Isomyia pseudolucilia* (1928), *Myospila flavibasis* (1925), and *Myospila femorata* (1935). Additionally, he contributed to the taxonomy of *Dichaetomyia setifemur* (1928), *Dichaetomyia flavocaudata* (1928), *Helina hirtifemorata* (1926), *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri* (1919), *Xenosia tarsalia* and *Xenosia scutellaris* (1935), and *Haematostoma austeni* and *Neomyia fletcheri*.  \n\nMALLOCH’s research extended to ecological studies, including documenting the distribution of *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* in Sulawesi, Indonesia (1927), and publishing works on fly larvae ecology in 1923 and 1929. He was also involved in broader taxonomic efforts, such as classifying *Scathophaga* species in 1935 and contributing to the 1927 study on Sulawesi’s fly fauna. His work on *Eutrichota labradorensis* (1920) and *Eutrichota magna* (1920) further highlights his focus on regional biodiversity.  \n\nSome of his lesser-known contributions include describing *Haematobia australis* (1932), *Musca jacobsoni* (1928), *Tainanina sarcophagoides* (1931), and *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri* (1919). He also authored descriptions for species such as 黑瓣莫蝇 (*Xenosia scutellaris*, 1935) and 毛股阳蝇 (1926), as well as *Chaetolispa* and *Xenolispa* in 1922 and 1923. MALLOCH’s 1930s work included the 1930 study on fly species, the 1932 description of *Haematobiosa austeni*, and the 1935 classification of *Dexopollenia geniculata*.  \n\nHis publications appeared in journals like *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.*, *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica*, and *Zool. Anz. (Leipzig)*, reflecting his international collaboration and influence. MALLOCH’s legacy includes foundational taxonomic work on flies, with his descriptions of *Lasiopelta* (1928) and *FLAVOCAUDATA* (1928) underscoring his role in expanding the understanding of dipteran diversity. Despite some entries listing species without specific years (e.g., *Eutrichota magna*), his active period is well-documented from 1917 to 1935, with a focus on morphological classification and ecological observations.  \n\nIn summary, MALLOCH was a prolific taxonomist whose work significantly advanced the study of flies, particularly in Asia and North America, through the establishment of genera, detailed species descriptions, and ecological research. His contributions remain critical to modern entomology, especially in resolving taxonomic complexities and documenting regional faunas.\",53\n4016,\"MALLOCH, 1927\",Study published in 1927 by Malloch on the fly species,13\n727,INDONESIA,\"\n\nIndonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago, is a significant region for the distribution of numerous fly species across its diverse islands and ecosystems. The country is associated with the presence of **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Pygophora respondens**, and **Pectiniseta pectinata**, which are documented in its territories. Additionally, **Musca convexifrons**, **Thecocarcelia parnarae**, **Argyrophylax phoeda**, and **Argyrophylax nigrotibialis** are found in Indonesia, alongside the **LUTEIVENTRIS** and **APICALIS DICHAETOMYIA** species of *Dichaetomyia*. The Chinese name **紫翠蝇** (likely referring to a specific species) is also recorded as occurring in the country.  \n\nIndonesia serves as an international distribution location for **Limnophora prominens** and **Limnophora albitarsis**, with the latter explicitly noted in the Malay Peninsula. The archipelago includes key regions such as **Java**, **Sumatra**, **Kalimantan**, **Lombok**, **Flores**, and the **Nusa Tenggara Islands**, which are type localities or sub-regions for several species. For example, **Dichaetomyia quadrata** is type-localized in Java, while **Ophyra chalcogaster** is found in Java as its type locality. **Hemipyrellia liguriens** is distributed in Java, Sulawesi, and other islands, and **Chlororhinia exempta** is specifically recorded in Kalimantan. **Helina hirtifemorata** and **Helina nudifemorata** are distributed in Lombok, Flores, and Sumatra, with the latter having Lombok and Flores as its type locality.  \n\nThe country is also linked to the **Bengalia** species, **Borbororhina bivittata**, **Caricea boops**, **Cosmina limbipennis**, **Lispe loewi**, **Lispe sinica**, **Myospila argentata**, **Lasiopelta** species, **Sturmiopsis inferens**, and **Tainanina sarcophagoides**. Notably, **Sarcorohdendorfia seniorwhitei** is distributed in Java, and **Sarcorohdendorfia inextricata** has international distribution records. The **Indian greenbottle fly** and **Winthemia** genus are also present in Indonesia.  \n\nIndonesia is highlighted as a foreign distribution location for certain species, such as **Musca crassirostris** and **Carcelia kockiana**, as well as **Chaetexorista javana**. The **Stomorhina** genus is mentioned as occurring in Indonesia, though it is described as a \"\"foreign location\"\" in some contexts. The **Neomyia** species are found in Sumatra and the Nusa Tenggara Islands, while **Hypopygiopsis infumata** is recorded in Java. **Ophyra chalcogaster** is type-localized in Java, and **Chrysomya bezziana** is distributed in the Oriental region with Indonesia as its type locality.  \n\nThe **Dichaetomyia** genus is internationally distributed in Indonesia, with type localities in Sumatra, Java, and Kalimantan. The **Lasiopelta** and **Lasiopelta** species are grouped with **Myospila argentata** in the country. **Anthomyia illocata** and **Aphi** (potentially related to *Atherigona orbicularis* as a geographic subspecies) are also documented. The **species I. divisa** and **I. mandarina** are found in Indonesia, as are the **Borbororhina bivittata** and **Pales carbonata** (炭黑栉寄蝇).  \n\nIn summary, Indonesia is a critical hub for fly biodiversity, hosting a wide array of species across its islands. Its role as a type locality for several species, such as *Dichaetomyia quadrata* and *Ophyra chalcogaster*, underscores its importance in entomological taxonomy. The country’s distribution records span both native and foreign species, reflecting its ecological diversity and connectivity to broader biogeographic regions. Key islands like Java, Sumatra, Lombok, and Kalimantan are repeatedly cited as sub-regions for specific species, emphasizing localized hotspots of fly activity.

The type species of *Lasiopelta* is *Lasiopelta orientalis*, a designation that anchors the genus in the taxonomic framework established by Malloch. These flies are part of the broader Diptera order, though specific ecological or behavioral details about the genus are not provided in the descriptions. The combination of unique thoracic bristle arrangements and specialized wing venation highlights the evolutionary adaptations or taxonomic distinctiveness of *Lasiopelta* within its group.
