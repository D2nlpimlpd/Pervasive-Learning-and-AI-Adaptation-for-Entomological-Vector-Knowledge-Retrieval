This species is distinguished by a combination of morphological characteristics that aid in its identification. Notably, it exhibits specific abdominal plate coloration, a feature highlighted in its original description. Additionally, the bristle patterns on the hind femur are a key diagnostic trait, though the exact configuration is not detailed in the provided data. Another defining feature is the presence of a large submedian anterior ventral bristle on the middle tibia, which further differentiates it from closely related species. While the term \"\"housefly\"\" is used in one description, it is important to clarify that *Musca crassirostris* is a distinct species within the *Musca* genus, which includes the common housefly (*Musca domestica*). The morphological traits described—particularly the bristle patterns and abdominal coloration—serve as critical markers for taxonomic classification and differentiation. These features collectively contribute to the species' unique identity in entomological studies. The descriptions provided are consistent in attributing the species to Stein and emphasizing its morphological distinctiveness, with no direct contradictions to resolve.

Guangdong’s ecological diversity, including cities like Zhanjiang, supports these species, with some holotypes (e.g., *Mydaea latielecta*) and type localities (e.g., Taishan for *Atherigona* species) originating there. The province is also tied to *Mydaea breviscutellata* and *Fucellia apicalis*, as well as *Hebecnema fumosa* and *Lydella grisescens*. \n\nIn summary, Guangdong serves as a critical area for entomological study, hosting a wide array of fly species across genera such as *Atherigona*, *Chrysomya*, *Dichaetomyia*, *Helina*, *Musca*, and *Carcelia*, with specific localities like Guangzhou, Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Dianbai frequently cited. Its coastal and inland habitats contribute to the presence of both native and regionally significant species, including those with agricultural or parasitic relevance.
