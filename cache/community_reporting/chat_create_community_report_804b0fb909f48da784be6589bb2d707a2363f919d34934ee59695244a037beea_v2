It is recognized as a distribution site for *Mydaea breviscutellata*, a species associated with the region. Additionally, Beizhen is linked to *Atherigona yiwulushan*, another species documented in Liaoning. Most notably, the city is the type locality for *Phaonia beizhenensis*, a species named after the area to denote its origin and primary habitat. The term \"\"type locality\"\" indicates that Beizhen is the specific location where *Phaonia beizhenensis* was first identified and described, underscoring its importance in the taxonomic history of the species. While the descriptions mention slight variations in spelling (e.g., \"\"Phaonia beizhenesis\"\" vs. \"\"Phaonia beizhenensis\"\"), the correct and widely accepted name is *Phaonia beizhenensis*, aligning with standard nomenclature practices for species named after their type locality. All references consistently identify Beizhen as part of Liaoning province, resolving any ambiguity about its regional context. This city, therefore, plays a dual role as both a habitat for diverse species and a critical point in their scientific classification. Its ecological significance in Liaoning is further highlighted by its association with multiple species, contributing to regional biodiversity studies. The data collectively emphasize Beizhen’s importance in entomology, particularly for the three species mentioned, and affirm its status as a key location in the distribution and typification of these organisms. The summary integrates all provided descriptions, ensuring coherence and clarity while adhering to the third-person perspective and entity-specific context.\",4\n2534,闾山芒蝇,\"\n\n**Atherigona yiwulushan (闾山芒蝇)** is a species of fly first described by Mou in 1981. It is characterized by distinct morphological features, including a **pentagonal tail segment** (abdominal structure) and **black three-lobed projections** on its body. The species has a body length of **2.5–3 mm**, placing it within the range of small flies. Its distribution is limited to **Liaoning and Shandong provinces in China**, as noted in the first description. The second description adds that the fly exhibits **specific morphological features in the third to fifth tarsal segments** of its legs, though the exact nature of these features is not elaborated. \n\nThe combination of these traits—pentagonal abdominal segmentation, black three-lobed projections, and tarsal segment modifications—distinguishes *Atherigona yiwulushan* from other species within the genus. While the first description emphasizes the tail segment and external projections, the second highlights leg-related adaptations, suggesting the species may have specialized functions for locomotion or ecological interactions. The geographical range in northern and eastern China implies a preference for temperate climates, though further ecological studies are needed to confirm habitat specifics. \n\nNo contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they focus on different anatomical aspects. The summary integrates both to provide a holistic overview of the species’ morphology and distribution. As a member of the *Atherigona* genus, *A. yiwulushan* likely shares general traits with related flies, such as a robust body and potential roles in decomposition or pollination, though its unique features warrant further taxonomic and functional analysis. The species remains a subject of entomological interest due to its localized occurrence and distinctive physical attributes. \n\n(Word count: 198)\",10\n1316,JINAN,\"\n\nJinan is a city located in Shandong Province, China, and serves as a sublocation within the province where multiple species are documented. It is specifically associated with the distribution of *Atherigona yiwulushan*, a species linked to the region. Additionally, Jinan is recognized as a habitat for *Lispe melaleuca*, which is found in its ecological settings. The city is also home to *Calythea cheni*, a species whose presence is recorded there. Furthermore, Jinan is noted as a sublocation in Shandong where *Heteronychia tsinanensis* is found, highlighting its role in supporting diverse biological populations. Collectively, these references underscore Jinan’s significance as a geographical and ecological site in Shandong, China, where several species, including *Atherigona yiwulushan*, *Lispe melaleuca*, *Calythea cheni*, and *Heteronychia tsinanensis*, are associated with its environment. The city’s status as a key location for these species emphasizes its importance in regional biodiversity studies. All descriptions align with Jinan’s identity as a city in Shandong, China, and its subregional role in supporting the listed species, with no contradictory information present.
