It is characterized by distinct morphological traits, including a divided sixth tergite (the dorsal segment of the abdomen) and long marginal bristles, which are key features for taxonomic identification. Additionally, the genus exhibits well-developed lateral processes on the sternite (ventral abdominal segment), with the central process present but lacking lateral branches. These structural adaptations may relate to ecological or behavioral functions, though specific roles remain under study.  \n\nGeographically, **Heteronychia** is distributed across the Palaearctic region, with a notable presence in Europe and the Mediterranean. However, its species are generally rare, suggesting limited population sizes or specialized habitats. The genus is further distinguished by its larval ecology: larvae are known to parasitize snails and locusts, or develop on carrion. This dual lifestyle—parasitic and saprophagous—highlights the genus’s ecological versatility, though the exact mechanisms of host interaction or carrion utilization are not fully detailed in the provided data.  \n\nThe combination of morphological features, such as the divided sixth tergite and the unique sternite processes, alongside its Palaearctic distribution and larval habits, defines **Heteronychia** as a taxonomically and ecologically distinct group within the fly family. While the descriptions emphasize rarity and specific developmental strategies, they collectively underscore the genus’s niche roles in ecosystems, particularly in regulating snail and locust populations or contributing to decomposition processes. Further research may clarify the evolutionary significance of its anatomical traits and the extent of its ecological impact.  \n\n(Word count: 130)\",4\n279,CALLIPHORIDAE,\"\n\nCalliphoridae, commonly known as blowflies, is a family of flies characterized by distinct larval and adult morphological features. The larvae of this family possess well-developed anal plates and oval posterior spiracles, which are key diagnostic traits for identification. Additionally, they exhibit deep elliptical pits on the eighth abdominal segment, further distinguishing their anatomy. Adult Calliphoridae typically have long and slender anal cerci, a feature that contributes to their classification. The family is taxonomically divided into subfamilies such as Mesembrinellinae, Ameniinae, Calliphorinae, Chrysomyinae, Phormiinae, and Rhiniinae, each representing distinct evolutionary lineages and ecological adaptations. These subfamilies are recognized based on shared morphological, behavioral, and genetic characteristics. The combination of larval features—anal plates, pits, and specific spiracle structures—along with adult traits like elongated anal cerci, provides a comprehensive framework for studying the family. Calliphoridae species are ecologically significant, often playing roles in decomposition and nutrient cycling, while some are of medical or forensic interest due to their association with carrion or wound myiasis. The family’s global distribution and diverse habitats underscore its adaptability and importance in both natural and human-impacted environments.\",9\n3542,RHINIINAE,\"\n\nRHINIINAE is a subfamily within the family Calliphoridae, commonly known as blow flies, and was first described by the French entomologist Émile Louis David Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. This taxonomic group is characterized by its members' yellowish soft body hairs, a feature that distinguishes them from other subfamilies in the family. Additionally, species within RHINIINAE possess proboscis-like mouthparts, which are adapted for feeding on liquid or semi-liquid substances, a trait typical of many flies in the Calliphoridae family. The subfamily includes notable genera such as *Arrhinidia* and *Rhyncomya*, which are often studied for their ecological roles and morphological traits. While the broader family Calliphoridae is associated with carrion-feeding and forensic importance, RHINIINAE specifically contributes to this group’s diversity through its unique physical attributes and taxonomic history. The combination of its historical classification, morphological features, and inclusion of specific genera provides a comprehensive understanding of this subfamily’s place within dipteran taxonomy.\",2\n3537,MESAMBRIHELLINAE,A subfamily of Calliphoridae (墨丽蝇亚科) distinguished by a single renal-shaped posterior spiracle and non-telescopic ovipositor in females.>,1\n3540,CHRYSOMYINAE,A subfamily of Calliphoridae (金蝇亚科) with 4-5 scutellar bristles and hairy wing nodules.>,1\n3541,PHORMIINAE,A subfamily of Calliphoridae (伏蝇亚科) with bare wing nodules and postoccipital bristles.>,1\n3544,CATAPICEPHALINI,\"\n\nThe **CATAPICEPHALINI** is a tribe of flies within the subfamily Ameniinae, primarily characterized by distinct morphological features that distinguish it from other related groups. This tribe includes the genus *Catapicephala*, which is notable for its flat head structure, a trait that aligns with the broader description of the tribe. A key diagnostic feature of CATAPICEPHALINI is the absence of a central mesopleural depression, a structural characteristic that contributes to its taxonomic differentiation. Additionally, the tribe exhibits specific bristle arrangements, though the exact patterns are not fully detailed in the provided descriptions.  \n\nMales within this tribe display a particularly prominent trait: a broad forehead, which is further emphasized by the development of outer occipital bristles. These bristles are described as well-developed, suggesting they may play a role in species recognition, mating behaviors, or other ecological functions. The combination of a flat head and broad male forehead, along with the absence of the central mesopleural depression, forms a cohesive set of morphological markers that define the tribe.  \n\nThe taxonomic placement of CATAPICEPHALINI within Ameniinae indicates its evolutionary relationship to other bristle fly groups, though its unique features set it apart. The tribe’s name, derived from the Greek *kata* (downward) and *picephalos* (flat-headed), directly references the flat head morphology observed in its members. While the descriptions provided do not explicitly mention the ecological or behavioral roles of these traits, the structural adaptations—such as the broad forehead and specialized bristle arrangements—likely influence their interactions with the environment or conspecifics.  \n\nIn summary, the **CATAPICEPHALINI** is a morphologically distinct tribe of flies within Ameniinae, defined by a flat head (with broad foreheads in males), the absence of a central mesopleural depression, and developed outer occipital bristles. These features collectively support its classification and highlight its evolutionary specialization within the family. The inclusion of *Catapicephala* as a representative genus underscores the tribe’s unique identity in entomological taxonomy.\",2\n3538,AMENIINAE,A subfamily of Calliphoridae (迷蝇亚科) with angular m1+2 wing vein curvature and telescopic ovipositor in females.>,3\n3543,AMENIINI,A tribe within Ameniinae (迷蝇族) characterized by prominent facial ridges and specific bristle arrangements.>,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n213,HETERONYCHIA,CALLIPHORIDAE,Heteronychia belongs to the Calliphoridae family,13\n6516,CALLIPHORIDAE,RHINIINAE,Rhiniinae is a subfamily within the Calliphoridae family,11\n6511,CALLIPHORIDAE,MESAMBRIHELLINAE,Mesembrinellinae is a subfamily within the Calliphoridae family,10\n6514,CALLIPHORIDAE,CHRYSOMYINAE,Chrysomyinae is a subfamily within the Calliphoridae family,10\n6515,CALLIPHORIDAE,PHORMIINAE,Phormiinae is a subfamily within the Calliphoridae family,10\n6538,CATAPICEPHALINI,CATAPICEPHALA,Catapicephala is a genus within the Catapicephalini tribe,5\n6519,AMENIINAE,AMENIINI,Ameniini is a tribe within the Ameniinae subfamily,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
