The species is characterized by a yellow abdomen, a feature highlighted in multiple descriptions, and distinct lateral abdominal spots, as noted in one account. Its antennal segments are also described as yellow, adding to its morphological identification. The bristle patterns on the abdomen, another key diagnostic trait, are mentioned as specific but not further detailed in the provided data.  \n\nGeographically, **Pygophora respondens** is distributed across several regions. It is found in **Xinjiang, China**, as reported in one source, and extends internationally to **Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and other Pacific islands**, according to a broader distribution list. This suggests the species has a range spanning parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia, as well as the Pacific.  \n\nThe species has been illustrated in scientific literature, with a notable depiction by **Snyder in 1965**, which likely aids in its taxonomic identification. While the original description by Walker focused on abdominal features, subsequent references emphasize the combination of coloration (yellow abdomen and antennae) and structural traits (lateral spots, bristle patterns) to distinguish it.  \n\nIn summary, **Pygophora respondens (Walker, 1859)** is a fly species recognized for its yellow abdomen, lateral abdominal spots, and yellow antennal segments, with a specific bristle pattern. It is native to **Xinjiang, China**, and has a wider distribution across **Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and other Pacific islands**. The species was first described by Walker in 1859 and later illustrated by Snyder in 1965, contributing to its taxonomic history. The combination of its distinctive coloration and anatomical features, along with its geographic range, provides a comprehensive profile for identification and ecological study.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",23\n2922,CAROLINE ISLANDS,,3\n2923,MARSHALL ISLANDS,,2\n2919,PILIPINES,,1\n2920,IRIAN JAYA,,1\n2924,GILBERT ISLANDS,,1\n2931,IRIAN ISLAND,A location where Pectiniseta pectinata is distributed,1\n2932,SEYCHELLES ISLANDS,\"\n\nThe **Seychelles Islands** are an island nation and archipelago located in the Indian Ocean, northeast of Madagascar. Comprising 115 islands, the nation is renowned for its biodiversity and unique ecosystems. The islands serve as a critical habitat for the species **Pygophora respondens**, a plant native to this region. This species is distributed across the Seychelles, where it thrives in the tropical environment shaped by the islands' isolation and distinct geological history. The Seychelles' status as an island nation contributes to its ecological significance, as it hosts endemic flora and fauna found nowhere else on Earth. Conservation efforts in the area focus on preserving these natural resources, including the habitats of species like *Pygophora respondens*, which are integral to the islands' ecological balance.
