It serves as the type locality for the species *Mydaea setifemur kongdinga*, a member of the fly family Sarcophagidae, and is also associated with the type locality designations of *Phaonia kangdingensis*, *Phaonia asierrans*, and *Phaonia bruneaurea*, all of which belong to the genus *Phaonia* within the same family. These species are part of the subfamily Sarcophaginae, and their classification often references Kangding as the geographic origin of their type specimens. Additionally, Kangding is cited in the taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, a group within the Sarcophagidae family, further underscoring its role in the study and identification of these flies. The city is also noted as a location where certain species are found, contributing to regional biodiversity records. All descriptions consistently identify Kangding as situated in Sichuan Province, China, with no contradictions in its geographic or taxonomic significance. Its repeated mention as a type locality highlights its importance in the scientific documentation of Sarcophagidae species, particularly within the *Phaonia* genus. The city’s ecological and geographic characteristics likely support the presence of these species, making it a focal point for entomological research in the region. In summary, Kangding is a key reference site in Sichuan for the taxonomic classification of multiple Sarcophagidae species, including *Mydaea setifemur kongdinga* and several *Phaonia* species, and is integral to the study of this fly family.\",3\n3679,MAKENG,\"Makeng is a city in Sichuan province, China\",1\n2120,MANGKANG HAITONG,\"\n\nMangkang Haitong is a location in Tibet, China, and is recognized as a site where the species *Musca tibetana* is distributed.
