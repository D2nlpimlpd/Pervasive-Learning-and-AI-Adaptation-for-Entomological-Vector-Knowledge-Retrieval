It serves as a platform for researchers to describe and document new species, as well as provide detailed analyses of existing ones, across diverse animal groups. The journal has a particular focus on entomology, with notable contributions to the classification of insects, including species such as *Myospila fuscicoxa*, *Myospila laevis*, *Helina hirtifemorata*, and *Helina deleta*. Additionally, it has published descriptions of other organisms, such as *Sarcorohdendorfia mimobasalis*, and has been referenced for the publication of species like *Caricea odonta* in 1981, *Paradelia nototrigona* (with detailed figures and publication data), and *Tainanina yangchunensis*, the latter of which was described by Fan et Yao. The journal’s scope encompasses both morphological and phylogenetic approaches to taxonomy, reflecting its role in advancing understanding of animal biodiversity. Its multilingual content, including Chinese and English titles, underscores its accessibility to both domestic and international audiences. While some descriptions emphasize insect taxonomy, others highlight broader animal studies, indicating the journal’s interdisciplinary nature within zoological classification. The inclusion of specific examples and publication details from multiple entries demonstrates its utility as a primary source for taxonomic research in China and beyond. The journal’s name, derived from Latin (*Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica*), combines the terms \"\"zootaxonomy\"\" (animal classification) and \"\"Sinica\"\" (relating to China), reflecting its regional and scientific focus. It is widely recognized in the field for its rigorous peer-review process and contributions to documenting species diversity, particularly in understudied or regionally significant taxa. The journal’s historical records, such as the 1981 publication of *Caricea odonta*, illustrate its long-standing role in zoological science. Overall, *ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA* functions as a critical resource for taxonomists, providing detailed descriptions, illustrations, and systematic frameworks for a wide range of animal species, with a strong emphasis on Chinese fauna. Its multilingual format and diverse subject matter ensure relevance to global taxonomic research while maintaining a focus on regional biodiversity.

The area is associated with **Mydaea tinctoscutaris**, a species documented in entomological studies related to the region. Additionally, **Helina hirtifemorata** is known to be distributed in Longde, further highlighting its role as a biodiversity hotspot for flies. Another notable species, **Helina trivittata**, has also been identified in this location, underscoring Longde’s importance in the study of dipteran fauna. These findings suggest that Longde supports a diverse range of fly species, particularly within the genera *Mydaea* and *Helina*, which are of interest to researchers examining regional insect populations and ecosystems. The consistency across descriptions confirms that all three species are indeed linked to Longde, with no conflicting information to resolve. This location, therefore, serves as a key reference point for understanding the distribution and ecological dynamics of these specific fly species in Ningxia.
