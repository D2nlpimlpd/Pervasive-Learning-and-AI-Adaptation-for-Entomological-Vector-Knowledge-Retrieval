It serves as a domestic distribution location for multiple genera and species, including *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Eutrichota similis*, and *Lydella grisescens* alongside *Phryxe vulgaris*. The province hosts several *Helina* species, such as *Helina calceataeformis*, *Helina quadrum*, *Helina hirtifemorata*, *Helina hengshanensis*, and *Helina obscuratoides*, with the Yanbei region and Lin County specifically noted for some. *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca bezzii*, and *Musca conducens* are also part of its insect diversity, as is *Platymyia hortulana* and *Zenillia dolosa*.  \n\nShanxi is home to various *Phaonia* species, including *Phaonia datongensis*, *Phaonia submontana*, *Phaonia vulpinus*, *Phaonia graciloides*, *Phaonia xingxianensis*, *Phaonia wenshuiensis*, *Phaonia yanggaoensis*, *Phaonia longifurca*, *Phaonia fuscata*, and *Phaonia xiangningensis* and *Phaonia youyuensis*. These are found in locations like Xingxian, Taiyuan, and Lin County. The province also supports *Lydella grisescens*, *Phorbia securis xibeina* (type locality at Nanmewan, Yan’an), *Servaisia rossica*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, and *Parasarcophaga polystylata*.  \n\nNotable species include *Leucophora shanxiensis* and *Leucophora personata*, with *Leucophora dorsalis* specifically recorded in Taiyuan. *Coenosia* species such as *Coenosia dilatitarsis*, *Coenosia mollicula*, *Coenosia incisurata*, and *Coenosia strigipes* are present, as are *Hydrotaea bimaculatoides* and *Hydrotaea occulta*. The genus *Adia* and *Polleniopsis mongolica* are documented, along with *Mydaea discimana* and *Mydaea laxidetrita*.  \n\nShanxi’s insect records extend to *Lispe monochaita* and *Lispe loewi*, *Muscina assimilis* in Xingxian, *Pseudonupedia intersecta* in Taiyuan, and *Nupedia aestiva*, *Nupedia patellans*, and *Nupedia infirma*. The province is also associated with *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, *Blaesoxipha litoralis*, and *Cynomya mortuorum*. Specific localities like Jinci (Taiyuan) and Hanzhong are highlighted for *Egle cyrtacra* and *Graphomya rufitibia*, respectively.  \n\nShanxi has been a focus for entomological surveys, including work by the Shanxi Medical College. Its regions, such as Nanmifan, Huanglongshan, Ziwuling, and the Qinling Mountains, are noted for species like *Kramerea schuetzei* and *Pales pavida* (blue-black bristle fly). The province’s biodiversity includes rare or regionally significant species, such as *1278靴折麻蝇* and *1279膨端折麻蝇*, as well as *1351 Microspine Pierretia Fly*.  \n\nHowever, some descriptions mistakenly reference Shaanxi (e.g., *Calliphora axata* in Xi’an, *Musca sorbens* in Yulin) and should be excluded from Shanxi’s summary. The correct focus remains on Shanxi’s own distribution of species like *Fannia scalaris*, *Fannia similis*, *Hebecnema alba*, *Paraprosalpia tibialis*, and *Xenotachina fumifemoralis*.  \n\nIn total, Shanxi’s entomological profile reflects a rich and varied ecosystem, with multiple species of medical, agricultural, and ecological interest. Key areas for study include Taiyuan, Yan’an, and the Yanbei region, where specific species like *Phaonia mimofausta* (Ying County, Hanyuan) and *类绒粪泉蝇* (Lin County) are recorded.

The county's ecological and geographical characteristics have contributed to its role in the scientific documentation of these species. *Hydrotaea bimaculatoides*, a fly species within the genus *Hydrotaea*, is specifically noted for having its type locality established in Hequ, meaning the original specimens used to define the species were collected there. Similarly, *Lispe lanceoseta*, a member of the genus *Lispe* (family Syrphidae), was described based on observations or specimens from the same area, underscoring the county's importance in the study of syrphid flies. These associations highlight Hequ County as a key location for biodiversity research in Shanxi, particularly in the context of dipteran taxonomy. The convergence of these two species' records in the region suggests that Hequ County may harbor unique or representative habitats for such insects, though further ecological studies would be needed to confirm this.
