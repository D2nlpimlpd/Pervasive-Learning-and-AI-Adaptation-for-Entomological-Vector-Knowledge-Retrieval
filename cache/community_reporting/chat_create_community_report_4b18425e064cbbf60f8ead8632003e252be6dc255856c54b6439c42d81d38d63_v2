DENG is recognized as a co-author of the 1981 description of *Hydrophoria megaloba* and the 1987 description of *Helina dibrachiata*. Additionally, DENG co-described *宽角阳蝇* (a species name not fully translated into scientific nomenclature) in 1987. Collaborations with Fang and Li are highlighted in multiple works, including the co-description of *Phaonia subemarginata* and *Phorbia hypandrium*. DENG also co-authored the description of *Eutrichota bilobella* (Li et Deng) and *Helina inflata*, though the specific year for the latter is not provided.  \n\nIn the genus *Pegomya*, DENG is the primary author of several species, including *Pegomya folifera*, *Pegomya tenuiramula*, *Pegomya hamatacrophalla*, *Pegomya angusticerca*, *Pegomya simpliciforceps*, *Pegomya flaviprecoxa*, *Pegomya nudapicalis*, and *Pegomya melatrochanter*. Notably, *Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis* is listed as a subspecies under *Pegomya*, suggesting DENG’s work spans both species and subspecies-level taxonomy. DENG further co-authored the description of *Pegohylemyia sichuanensis* (Sichuan Spring Fly) with Li, and is credited as the sole author of *Pegohylemyia emeisencio* (峨泽菊泉种蝇), a species named in Chinese.  \n\nDENG’s work with Li extends to other genera, such as *Phorbia hypandrium* and *Eutrichota bilobella*, underscoring a recurring partnership in taxonomic research. The researcher’s contributions to *Phaonia* include authoring four species—*Phaonia lamellata*, *Phaonia subpalpata*, *Phaonia stenoparafacia*, and *Phaonia lucidula*—while co-describing *Phaonia subemarginata* with Fang and Li. This indicates a dual role as both a primary author and collaborator.  \n\nDENG’s publications span multiple decades, with documented work from 1981 to at least 1987. The researcher’s focus on diverse fly genera reflects a broad expertise in dipteran taxonomy. All descriptions are presented without contradictions, as the data consistently attributes DENG as either a primary author or co-author across species and genera. The summary consolidates DENG’s taxonomic contributions, emphasizing their collaborations and the range of species they have described, including both widely recognized scientific names and regionally specific Chinese designations.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",19\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2221,PEGOMYA ANGUSTICREARA,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,Acta Entomologica Sinica published the description of Pegomya angusticerca,70\n2226,PEGOMYA MELATROCHANTER,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,Acta Entomologica Sinica published the description of Pegomya melatrochanter,70\n5817,YIWEI YANGYING,FANG,Fang described the species YIWEI YANGYING,42\n6229,FANG,PHANOIA SUBEMARGINATA,Fang is an author of Phaonia subemarginata,40\n883,DENG,HYDROPHORIA MEGALOBA,Deng co-described the species Hydrophoria megaloba,25\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
