It is home to **Dichaetomyia bibax**, a species within the family Muscidae, and **长叶绿蝇** (*Lucilia longipalpis*), a green fly commonly found in the area. The province also hosts **Protocalliphora azurea** and **Protocalliphora chrysorrhoea**, both belonging to the family Calliphoridae, which are likely associated with ecological niches in its temperate climate. Additionally, **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa**, a sarcophagid fly, is documented as part of Jilin’s domestic distribution range.  \n\nJilin is a key habitat for **黄腹客夜蝇** (*Parasyrphus flaviventris*), a syrphid fly, and **巨尾阿丽蝇** (*Aldryina grandicaudata*) and **叉丽蝇** (*Aldryina ramosa*), which are distributed across the province. The region supports **Sinohylemya craspedodonta**, a species in the family Syrphidae, and **Eutrichota labradorensis**, a muscid fly specifically found in **Changbai Mountain**, a prominent natural area within Jilin. **Exorista rossica**, a tachinid fly, and **Helina sexmaculata**, a muscid fly, are also recorded as part of Jilin’s domestic fauna.  \n\nFurther, the province is a distribution site for **Phallocheira minor**, a syrphid fly, and two *Parasarcophaga* species: **Parasarcophaga (Jantia) crassipalpis** and **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) dux**, both of which are sarcophagid flies. Jilin’s ecological diversity includes **绯胫纹蝇** (*Hylemya rubrofemorata*), another syrphid species, and **斑腿透翅寄蝇** (*Exorista maculipennis*), a tachinid fly. The sub-location **Tonghua** is explicitly noted as part of Jilin’s administrative divisions, though its specific role in the distribution of these species is not detailed.  \n\nIn summary, Jilin Province serves as a critical ecological hub for multiple fly species, including green flies, sarcophagids, muscids, and tachinids, with some species localized to specific sub-regions like Changbai Mountain. Its position in northeastern China and varied habitats contribute to the presence of these insects, which are often linked to decomposition, pollination, or parasitism in local ecosystems. The data collectively highlight Jilin’s importance in the biogeography of these species, though further research may clarify interactions or population dynamics within the province.
