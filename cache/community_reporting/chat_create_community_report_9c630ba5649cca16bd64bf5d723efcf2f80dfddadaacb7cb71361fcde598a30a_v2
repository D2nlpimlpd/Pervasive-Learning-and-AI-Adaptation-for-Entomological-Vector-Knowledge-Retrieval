It serves as a distribution site for several species within the genus *Helina*, including *Helina parcepilosa*, *Helina calceataeformis*, and *Helina obscuratoides*. Additionally, the species *Halina moedlingensis* is noted as being distributed in Poland, though this may represent a typographical variation of *Helina* (a genus in the family Muscidae) and requires further clarification. The country also hosts *Coenosia octopunctata* and *Coenosia flavicornis*, both members of the *Coenosia* genus, as well as *Haematobia titillans* (the horn fly) and *Musca larvipara* (a species of housefly). *Pollenia pectinata*, a blow fly, is similarly reported in Poland. The genus *Sinonipponia*, though less commonly referenced, is also documented as occurring in the region. Furthermore, the genus *Helicophagella* is described as being distributed in Poland, though the term \"\"foreign country\"\" in this context may be an error, as all other descriptions explicitly reference Poland as the location. Finally, the data highlights that Poland is a country where at least one species exhibits international distribution, though the specific species is not named. These findings underscore Poland’s ecological significance as a habitat for both native and internationally distributed insect taxa, contributing to broader biodiversity studies in Europe. The summary consolidates all provided information, resolving potential typographical inconsistencies (e.g., \"\"Halina\"\" likely intended as *Helina*) and emphasizing the country’s role in the geographic range of these species.
