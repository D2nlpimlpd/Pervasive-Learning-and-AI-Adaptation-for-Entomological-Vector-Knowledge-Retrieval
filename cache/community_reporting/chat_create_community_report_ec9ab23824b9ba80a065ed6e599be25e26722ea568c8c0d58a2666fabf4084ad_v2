The region hosts a wide array of dipteran insects, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Frontina laeta*, *Helina calceataeformis* (specifically in Zhaowuda League, Chifeng), *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Muscina stabulans*, *Muscina angustifrons*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Sarcophaga variegata*, *Zenillia dolosa*, and *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *albiceps*. Tachina species such as *Tachina albidopilosa* and *Tachina nupta* are also documented there. Specific locations within Inner Mongolia, like Jining, Tumertei, Linhe, Siziwang Banner, Xilingol League, Hohhot (including Dagao Mountain and Naoxintai), Hulunbeier League, and Alashan Banner, are highlighted as key habitats for various species. For instance, *Cephalopina titillator* is found in Hohhot and Alashan Banner, while *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus* and *Oestromyia tarandi* occur in the northern Greater Khingan Range. \n\nThe region is notable for its biodiversity of genera and subgenera, including *Sarcophaga* (e.g., *KENT'S SARCOPHAGA*), *Protomiltogramma* (two species), *Strobilomyia* (e.g., *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Strobilomyia laricicola* in Ganhe and Guxuan), *Hydrophoria* (e.g., *Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*), and *Miltogramma* (*Miltogramma bimaculatum*, *Miltogramma tibitum*). Species such as *Phaenicia jagedaqiensis*, *Phaonia malaisei*, *Phaonia changbaishanensis*, and *Phaonia beizhenesis* are reported in Guyuan and other areas. The Caesar Greenbottle Fly and Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly are also present, alongside *Muscina assimilis* in Yitulihé, Tuluihé, and Genhé, and *Muscina atrifimbriae* in Jiagedaqi. \n\nInner Mongolia’s ecological diversity supports species like *Calliphora axata* (Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner, Hohhot), *Calliphora genarum* (southeastern Naoxintai), *Calliphora nigribarbis*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, and *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*. Notable distributions include *Haematobia titillans* and *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* in Alashan and Wuchuan Banner, *Paraprosalpia recta*, *Protocalliphora lii*, and *Blaesoxipha litoralis* (Keshiketeng Banner). The region is also home to *Carcelia lymantriae*, *Carcelia kockiana*, *Delia bisetosa*, *Delia sphaerobasis* (Ejina Banner), and *Delia planipalpis*. \n\nAdditional species documented in Inner Mongolia include *1238黑条蝇*, *1254钝叶污蝇*, *1256黑须污蝇*, *1281毛股折麻蝇*, *1341细角细麻蝇* (type locality), *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (Guoyuan), *731 BINGLU FLY*, *Austrophorocera*, *Azelia fengi*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Chionomyia vetula*, *Coenosia dilatitarsis*, *Dasyphora trichosterna*, *Dasyphora asiatica*, *Dasyphora albofasciata*, *Gonia bimaculata*, *Leucophora unilineata*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Macronychia griseola* and *Macronychia polyodon*, *Mydaea setifemur* and *Mydaea sinensis*, *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae*, *Peteina erinaceus*, *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Senotainia deserta*, *Apodacra pulchra*, *Servaisia rossica*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, and *Voria ruralis*. The genera *Zaira*, *Meigenia* (e.g., *Meigenia grandigena* in Dongwuqi), *Alashan Wohlfahrtia* (Alashan Banner), and *Bayan Wohlfahrtia* (Bayanhote) are also recorded. \n\nStudies on host relationships and outbreaks, such as those involving the Brush Spring Fly and *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (type locality in Hohhot), further underscore Inner Mongolia’s ecological importance. The region’s role as a domestic distribution hub for species like *Musca conducens*, *Musca bezzii*, *Musca sorbens*, *Musca tempestiva*, and *Musca autumnalis* highlights its significance in entomological research. With over 50 species and genera documented, Inner Mongolia serves as a critical area for understanding fly biodiversity in northern China.\",163\n5918,\"HORAE SOC,ENT.ROSS.\",A journal publishing research on the species Tachina albidopilosa,4\n4646,1257陈氏污蝇,\"1257陈氏污蝇 (Wohlfahrtia cheni) is a species of fly named after researcher Chen, with documented distribution in Inner Mongolia and the Soviet Union\",4\n3189,HELINA PARCEPILOSA,\"A species of fly described by Stein in 1907, found in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Gansu, and internationally in the Soviet Union, Europe, and Poland (mode origin).

Larvae are predators of wasps in deserts.\",5\n2049,POLAND,\"\n\nPoland, a European country, is home to a diverse range of insect species and genera, as documented in the provided data. It serves as a distribution site for several species within the genus *Helina*, including *Helina parcepilosa*, *Helina calceataeformis*, and *Helina obscuratoides*. Additionally, the species *Halina moedlingensis* is noted as being distributed in Poland, though this may represent a typographical variation of *Helina* (a genus in the family Muscidae) and requires further clarification. The country also hosts *Coenosia octopunctata* and *Coenosia flavicornis*, both members of the *Coenosia* genus, as well as *Haematobia titillans* (the horn fly) and *Musca larvipara* (a species of housefly). *Pollenia pectinata*, a blow fly, is similarly reported in Poland. The genus *Sinonipponia*, though less commonly referenced, is also documented as occurring in the region. Furthermore, the genus *Helicophagella* is described as being distributed in Poland, though the term \"\"foreign country\"\" in this context may be an error, as all other descriptions explicitly reference Poland as the location. Finally, the data highlights that Poland is a country where at least one species exhibits international distribution, though the specific species is not named. These findings underscore Poland’s ecological significance as a habitat for both native and internationally distributed insect taxa, contributing to broader biodiversity studies in Europe. The summary consolidates all provided information, resolving potential typographical inconsistencies (e.g., \"\"Halina\"\" likely intended as *Helina*) and emphasizing the country’s role in the geographic range of these species.
