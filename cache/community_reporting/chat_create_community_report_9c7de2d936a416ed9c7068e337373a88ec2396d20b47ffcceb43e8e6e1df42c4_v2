It is distributed in Sichuan Province, China, specifically in Ya'an Zhougong Mountain (type locality).\",3\n357,四川,\"\n\nSichuan Province, located in southwestern China, is a significant region for the distribution of numerous insect species, particularly flies and other arthropods. It is home to multiple species of the genus *Dichaetomyia*, as well as *松毛虫缅麻蝇* (Dichotomius sp.) and *盘突缅麻蝇* (Dichotomius sp.), which are documented within its ecological range. The province supports the presence of blowflies such as *Lucilia sinensis* and *Lucilia shenyangensis*, along with green bottle flies like *长叶绿蝇* (Lucilia longifolia) and *毛腹绿蝇* (Lucilia pilosa). Additionally, Sichuan hosts species of the genus *Isomyia*, including *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Isomyia oestracea*, as well as *Protocalliphora azurea*, a species of bot fly.  \n\nThe region is also notable for its role in the domestic distribution of other genera and species. For example, *Agria xiangchengensis*, *Helina nemorum*, and *宽角阳蝇* (Helina laticornis) are all recorded in Sichuan. The province serves as a key habitat for *Xenotachina* species and *Onesia* species, further highlighting its biodiversity. Specific type localities are associated with Sichuan, such as *长腹鬃粪蝇* (Sepsis longabdominalis), whose type locality is Jiulao Cave on Mount Emei, and *渡口白麻蝇* (Dialyta halterata), which is linked to the province as its type locality.  \n\nSichuan’s ecological diversity extends to parasitic and myiasis-related species. It is a documented distribution area for *1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇* (Chrysomya sinensis), *1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇* (Chrysomya abdominalis), and *1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇* (Chrysomya sumatrensis), as well as *牛皮蝇* (Hypoderma bovis), a species known for causing bovine myiasis. The province is also associated with the *酸棘蝇群* (Acridophaga species group) and the *盘叶泉种蝇* (Delia pannonicola) and *峨泽菊泉种蝇* (Delia oryzae), both of which are found in its agricultural or ecological zones.  \n\nFurther, Sichuan is a documented location for *Sinohylemya craspedodonta* and *Phorbia hypandrium*, and it supports the presence of *Pyrellia cyanicolor* and *Delia echinata*. The genus *Rypellia* is recorded in Huili, the type locality for *Rypellia huiliensis* (Ni), as well as other areas within the province. *峨眉亚麻蝇* (Rypellia emeiana) and *肥须亚麻蝇* (Rypellia crassicornis) are specifically noted as distributed in Sichuan.  \n\nIn summary, Sichuan Province is a critical hub for the domestic and regional distribution of a wide array of insect species, including blowflies, green bottle flies, parasitic flies, and others. Its role as a type locality for certain species, such as *长腹鬃粪蝇* and *渡口白麻蝇*, underscores its importance in entomological research.
