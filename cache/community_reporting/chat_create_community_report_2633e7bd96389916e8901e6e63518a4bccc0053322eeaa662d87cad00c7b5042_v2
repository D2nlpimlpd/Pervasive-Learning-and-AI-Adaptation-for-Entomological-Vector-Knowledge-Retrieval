It is characterized by a narrow black dorsal abdominal stripe, a feature that distinguishes it within its genus. The fly also possesses a feathered arista, a bristle-like structure on the head that is often used in taxonomic identification. Its body length is approximately 6.5 mm, placing it within the typical size range for members of the Hydrophoria genus.  \n\nThe species has a broad geographic distribution, occurring in multiple continents. It is found in **Heilongjiang** (a region in northeastern China), as well as in **Asia**, **Europe**, and **North America**. In Europe, it is specifically documented in **Scania**, a region in southern Sweden, which aligns with the first description’s mention of \"\"Sweden Scania.\"\" This clarification resolves any ambiguity in the second description, which only notes \"\"Scania\"\" without specifying the country. The presence of *Hydrophoria ambigua* in these regions suggests a wide ecological adaptability, though specific habitat preferences or ecological roles are not detailed in the provided data.  \n\nThe two descriptions provided are largely consistent, with the primary difference being the explicit mention of Sweden in the first. By consolidating the information, the summary confirms the species’ taxonomic origin, physical traits, and global distribution. No contradictory details exist in the descriptions, allowing for a unified account. The species remains a subject of interest for entomologists due to its cross-continental presence and morphological features, which may aid in further studies of its taxonomy, behavior, or ecological interactions.  \n\nThis synthesis ensures all key attributes—morphology, authorship, and geographic range—are included while maintaining clarity and coherence.

Scania is recognized as the type locality for **Hydrophoria ambigua**, a species that was initially documented in this area. Additionally, the region is noted as the type locality for **Insecta lapponica**, another species first identified and described there. Scania also holds importance for **Lasiomma strigilatum**, which was first recorded in the region, further establishing its role in entomological and biological research. All descriptions consistently identify Scania as a region in Sweden, with no contradictions in its geographic designation. The repeated emphasis on Scania as a type locality underscores its ecological and scientific relevance in the study of these species.

Additionally, **Motuo** is associated with **喜马拉雅粪泉蝇** (*Himalayan dung fly*), a species likely linked to the local ecosystem. The county also serves as a habitat for **Insecta lapponica**, an insect species noted in the area. These findings highlight Motuo's ecological importance in supporting diverse arthropod populations, particularly within the context of Tibetan biodiversity.

Additionally, Emeishan is part of the distribution range for *Yibin Fannia*, a species associated with the mountain's unique environmental conditions. The area is characterized as a location in Sichuan, China, where these organisms thrive, likely due to the mountain's biodiversity and specific microhabitats. While some descriptions refer to Emeishan broadly as a \"\"location,\"\" the more precise identification of it as a mountain in Sichuan Province aligns with the majority of the data and provides clearer context for its ecological role.
