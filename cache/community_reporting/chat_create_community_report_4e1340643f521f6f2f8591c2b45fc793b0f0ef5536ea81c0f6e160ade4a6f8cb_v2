In 1964 and 1973, Schumann published works focused on the genus *Onesia* and related species, establishing a foundation for understanding this group of organisms. These studies likely involved taxonomic descriptions, ecological observations, or behavioral analyses, though specific details are not provided in the descriptions.  \n\nIn 1986, Schumann expanded their research to include the distribution of *Calliphora pattoni*, a species of blow fly, and the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly (*Calliphora* sp.), particularly in the context of Afghanistan. The 1986 study on the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly’s distribution in Afghanistan is explicitly highlighted, suggesting it may be a significant or standalone work. This aligns with another 1986 reference to Afghanistan in the text, which could pertain to the same study or a separate one, though the connection is not clarified. The mention of *Calliphora pattoni* in 1986 indicates Schumann’s work on blow fly species, possibly contributing to biogeographical or ecological datasets.  \n\nAdditionally, Schumann is referenced in the text for providing figures A57, A59, A60, and A61, which may illustrate findings or data from their studies. These figures could relate to the distribution maps, morphological characteristics, or other visual representations of the species discussed. The inclusion of these figures underscores Schumann’s role in supporting visual documentation for entomological research.  \n\nWhile the descriptions do not specify whether the 1986 works on *Calliphora pattoni* and the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly are distinct or part of a single study, the repeated emphasis on Afghanistan in 1986 suggests a regional focus for that year’s research. The earlier works on *Onesia* (1964 and 1973) and the 1986 studies on blow flies demonstrate Schumann’s engagement with diverse insect groups and geographic regions. The references to figures further highlight their contribution to visualizing scientific data.  \n\nIn summary, **SCHUMANN** is recognized as a researcher who authored works on the genus *Onesia* in the 1960s and 1970s, and later contributed to the study of blow fly species, particularly *Calliphora pattoni* and the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly, in 1986, with a notable focus on Afghanistan. Their publications also include visual elements (figures A57, A59, A60, A61) that support the text’s analysis. The apparent overlap in 1986 references is resolved by attributing both the *Calliphora pattoni* and Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly studies to the same year, with the Afghanistan context unifying these contributions.\",13\n3845,翼尾蚓蝇,Onesia (Pellonesia) pterygoides is a species of earthworm fly described by Lu et Fan in 1982 with specific morphological characteristics,6\n3837,PAPUA,Region where the genus Onesia is distributed,1\n971,伊春,\"\n\nYichun is a city located in the Heilongjiang Province of China, known for its ecological significance as a habitat for specific species.

Both *Onesia variola* and *Delia lineariventris* are associated with the biodiversity of Yichun, though their ecological roles or classifications may differ. The city’s environment, likely influenced by its location in northeastern China, supports these species, contributing to regional scientific studies. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as both confirm Yichun’s role as a key location for these species, with one specifying it as the type locality for *Onesia variola* and the other noting the presence of *Delia lineariventris*.

Additionally, they are credited with describing species in 1915, demonstrating their expertise in taxonomic classification. A specific example of their research from the same year, 1915, involves the larval development of *Onesia sepulcralis*, a marine organism, indicating their focus on developmental biology and life cycle studies of aquatic species. These works collectively highlight Keilin’s role in advancing understanding of parasitic organisms and marine invertebrates during this period. The 1915 and 1917 studies suggest a sustained engagement with parasitology, with the earlier work potentially laying foundational insights that informed their later research. While the descriptions do not clarify whether the 1915 species descriptions and *Onesia sepulcralis* study were part of the same publication or separate projects, they underscore Keilin’s interdisciplinary contributions to both parasitology and marine biological research. Their work remains referenced for its methodological rigor and taxonomic significance, particularly in documenting larval stages and species identification.
