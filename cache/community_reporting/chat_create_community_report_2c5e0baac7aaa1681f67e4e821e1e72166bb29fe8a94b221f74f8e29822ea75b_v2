In 1889, Bergenstamm co-described the genus *Discochaeta* and the species *Dexodes machairopsis*, as well as the genus *Pseudogonia*. The same year also saw the description of *Lophyromyia clausa*, though the specific role of Bergenstamm in this work is not detailed. By 1891, Bergenstamm contributed to the taxonomy of *Xylotachina* and *Leucomyia*, with the latter being described alongside other authors. In 1893, Bergenstamm co-authored the description of the genus *Eutachina* with Brauer, as well as *Synthesiomyia* and *Cryptolucilia* (also with Brauer). Additionally, Bergenstamm is associated with the genus *Pseudoperichaeta*, though the exact year for this contribution is unspecified. The entity *Metoposisyrops* was co-described in 1916, marking a later collaboration. Bergenstamm’s work primarily focused on dipteran taxonomy, with notable partnerships in describing genera such as *Xylotachina* (1891) and *Eutachina* (1893). While some descriptions are attributed to co-authorship with Brauer, others are listed without specific collaborators. The species *Dexodes machairopsis* and *Lophyromyia clausa* are explicitly tied to Bergenstamm’s 1889 efforts, alongside the genera *Discochaeta*, *Pseudogonia*, and *Pseudoperichaeta*. The 1893 contributions include *Eutachina*, *Synthesiomyia*, and *Cryptolucilia*, further solidifying Bergenstamm’s role in classifying diverse fly taxa. Despite variations in the years and collaborators mentioned, the descriptions consistently highlight Bergenstamm’s expertise in entomology and taxonomy, particularly in the 1880s and 1890s. The entity’s legacy is marked by foundational work in dipteran classification, with multiple genera and species bearing their name as a co-author. No contradictions in the data are evident, as the descriptions align in emphasizing Bergenstamm’s collaborative and taxonomic contributions across different genera and time periods.\",13\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9032,LEUCOMYIA,BRAUER ET BERGENSTAMM,Brauer et Bergenstamm described the genus Leucomyia in 1891,19\n11200,METOPOPSISYRPS,BRAUER,Brauer co-described the genus Metoposisyrops,19\n10430,BRAUER,EUTACHINA,Brauer co-described the genus Eutachina with Bergenstamm in 1889,18\n10646,BRAUER,DEXODES MACHAIOPSIS,Brauer co-described the species Dexodes machairopsis in 1889,18\n11613,透翅寄蝇属,BERGENSTAMM,Bergenstamm于1893年与Brauer共同描述了透翅寄蝇属,18\n9108,BERGENSTAMM,LEUCOMYIA,Bergenstamm co-described the genus Leucomyia in 1891,16\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
