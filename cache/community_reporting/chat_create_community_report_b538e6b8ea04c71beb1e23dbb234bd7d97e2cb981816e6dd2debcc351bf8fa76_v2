Specific species such as **1431家蚕追寄蝇** (likely a Chinese nomenclature for a parasitoid fly species) and **Meigenia majuscula** are explicitly recorded in African ecosystems. The continent also hosts multiple species from the **FLY GENUS** and **SPALLANZANIA GENUS**, though these terms may refer to broader taxonomic groups or specific unlisted species. Notably, **Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina dorsalis**, a blowfly species, and **Muscina assimilis**, **Synthesiomyia nudiseta**, and **Passeromyia heterochaeta** (all within the Muscidae family) are found in Africa. Additionally, the **Stomorhina** genus includes several species distributed there, while **Delia diluta** (a seedcorn maggot) and **Carcelia kockiana** (a tachinid fly) are present as part of their geographic ranges.  \n\nThe **Eumetopiella** genus and **Senotainia** genus are also documented in Africa, alongside the **Lasiopelta** species, which are specifically associated with the tropical zone of the continent. **Anthomyia procellaris**, a species of flesh fly, is distributed in Africa, as is **Neomyia**, a genus where some species exhibit distinctive yellow abdominal coloration. The mention of \"\"foreign\"\" in certain descriptions (e.g., \"\"foreign continent\"\" or \"\"foreign location\"\") appears to reflect the perspective of the source rather than an inherent contradiction, as all references ultimately confirm Africa as the region of distribution.  \n\nIn summary, Africa serves as a key habitat for a diverse array of fly species and genera, spanning ecological and taxonomic groups such as parasitoids, blowflies, and flesh flies. These include both widely distributed genera like **Scathophaga** and **Stomorhina**, as well as regionally specific species like **Lasiopelta** in the tropics and **Neomyia** with unique morphological traits. The continent’s role in supporting such biodiversity underscores its ecological significance for these insect populations.
