Their work spanned multiple genera and species, with a focus on describing and classifying diverse fly species across various regions, including Europe, Asia, and India. Key contributions include the establishment of the genus *Enneastigma* in 1916 and the description of its type species *Engyneura setigera* in the same year. STEIN also founded the genus *Pseudocoenosia* in 1916 and described the species *Aphananeura echinata*.  \n\nIn 1907, STEIN described numerous species, including *Hydrophoria maculipennis*, *Drymeia metatarsata*, *Drymeia spinifemorata* (noted in a zoological academic journal), *Delia gracilis*, *Delia nigribasis*, *Hydrotaea spinosa*, *Hydrotaea pandellei* (1899 and 1907), *Lasiopelta longicornis* (1915 and 1928), *Lispe bivittata* (1909), and *Musca crassirostris* (1903). They also documented *Pygophora maculipennis* in 1909 and *Pegohylemyia depressa* (1907, later linked to the Chinese name 扁狭泉种蝇) and *Pegohylemyia profuga* (1916). Notably, STEIN described the species *毛足近脉花蝇* (possibly *Nupedia nigroscutellata*, 1920) and *黑尾缘花蝇* (1908), published in *Mitt. Zool. Mus. Berlin*.  \n\nTheir work extended to subspecies and forms, such as *Brontaea tonitrui variegata* and *Hydrophoria melaena* (1907). STEIN was associated with the genus *Dichaetomyia*, describing species like *Dichaetomyia monticola*, *Dichaetomyia nubiana*, *Dichaetomyia lineata*, *Dichaetomyia apicalis*, *Dichaetomyia antellata*, *Dichaetomyia alternans*, and *Dichaetomyia pallicornis* (1915). They also described *Delia planipalpis* (1898), *Delia hirtitibia*, *Delia angustissima*, and *Delia uniseriata*.  \n\nIn the *Phaonia* genus, STEIN described *Phaonia decussata*, *Phaonia rufitarsis* (1907), *Phaonia tenuirostris* (1907), and *Phaonia halterata* (1893), while their 1918 work included *Anthomyia plumiseta*. They documented *Ophyra spinigera* (1910), *Ophyra hirtitibia*, and *Ophyra simplex* (1915), as well as *Myospila laevis* (1900) and *Myospila tenax* (1918). STEIN’s 1898 description of *Fannia similis* and 1918 work on *Graphomya rufitibia* further highlight their early contributions.  \n\nAdditional species attributed to STEIN include *Lasiomma curtigena*, *Sinochirosia variegata* (type species for *Sinochirosia* in 1907), *Caricea boops* (1918, in India), *Caricea vernalis* (1907), *Leucophora dorsalis* (1916), *Helina lateralis* (1904), *Helina coronata* (1915), *Helina parcepilosa* (1907), and *Helina deleta* (1914, under *Mydaea*).

Despite some inconsistencies in dates (e.g., *Pegomya geniculata* cited as 1907 and 1834, likely a typographical error), their legacy as a foundational figure in dipteran taxonomy remains clear.

These geographic ranges suggest a possible adaptation to temperate and alpine environments, though specific ecological preferences remain undocumented in the provided data. \n\nBoth descriptions confirm the T-shaped black stripes on abdominal segments (tergites) and the presence of a white alula as defining traits. The first description adds the body length of 4 mm, while the second emphasizes the distribution in Shanxi and the Alps. No contradictions exist between the two sources, as they align on key morphological and geographic details.

It is characterized by a slender rostrum, a morphological feature that distinguishes it from other members of the genus. The species also exhibits a non-forked terminal segment of the lateral tail plate, a key taxonomic trait noted in its classification. Delia gracilis has a body length of approximately 7.5 mm, placing it within the typical size range for flies in this genus. Geographically, it is known to inhabit Qinghai, China, specifically in the regions of Huangyuan and Bulhanbuda Mountain. These habitats likely reflect its ecological preferences, though further details on its behavior or life cycle are not provided in the descriptions. The combination of its slender rostrum, non-forked tail plate structure, and specific geographic distribution in Qinghai underscores its unique identification within the *Delia* genus.

It is characterized by a body length ranging from 4.5 to 6 mm, with a distinct morphological feature being a short and blunt anal plate terminal process, which differentiates it from the closely related *尖扁泉种蝇*. Additionally, *扁狭泉种蝇* lacks small projections on the lateral lobes of the anal plate, a trait that further distinguishes it from other species in the group. The type locality for this species is Qinghai, China, where it was originally identified. While one source notes its distribution as extending to Japan, Europe, and North America, another description emphasizes its primary association with Qinghai. This discrepancy may reflect regional records or taxonomic updates, but the species is definitively documented in Qinghai as its origin and core habitat. *扁狭泉种蝇* is part of the broader *Pegohylemyia* genus, which includes other species with similar ecological or morphological traits. Its classification and distinguishing features are critical for accurate identification within the group, particularly in differentiating it from *尖扁泉种蝇*. The species’ presence in multiple continents suggests a potential for wider dispersal, though further research may clarify its full geographic range. Morphologically, the combination of a short, blunt anal plate and the absence of lateral lobe projections provides a reliable diagnostic marker for entomologists. As a member of the *Pegohylemyia* genus, it contributes to the study of dipteran biodiversity and ecological adaptations in its habitats.\",4\n1250,三齿泉种蝇,,4\n1575,毛胫厕蝇,\"毛胫厕蝇 (Fannia ciliata Stein, 1895) is a species of fly described by Stein in 1895.
