In 1981, Qian and Fan co-established the subgenus *Apicamplexa* and described the species *Pierretia bihami*, *Bellardia sastylata*, and *Sinoprosa aertica*. They also co-authored the genus *HUO HUAYING SHU* in the same year. Additionally, Qian was involved in the description of *Hydrophoria longissima*, *Hydrophoria crassiforceps*, and *Hydrophoria pronata*, though the exact year for the latter two is unspecified. In 1984, Qian independently described the species *Delia sphaerobasis*. By 1988, Qian co-described *Leucophora brevifrons dasyprosterna* and contributed to the ecological habit data of a fly species in Xinjiang, China. Qian and Fan also collaborated on *Drymeia xinjiangensis*, published in *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, and *Eutrichota aertica*. Furthermore, Qian is credited as a co-author for *Pegomya crinilamella* and *E. hamata* and *E. quadrirecta*, the latter two being described alongside Fan. Notably, Qian is one of the scientists who described *Pyrellia habaheensis*, a species of fly associated with the Habahe region. Their work spans multiple genera and subgenera, including *Pierretia*, *Bellardia*, *Drymeia*, *Eutrichota*, *Leucophora*, and *Sinoprosa*, with a focus on entomological research in China. The descriptions often appear in academic journals such as *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, reflecting Qian’s role in advancing the classification of Diptera species. Collaborations with Fan are central to many of these contributions, particularly in the 1980s, while Qian also conducted independent research on species like *Delia sphaerobasis*. The ecological data provided for Xinjiang further underscores Qian’s engagement with regional biodiversity studies. Overall, Qian’s work demonstrates a multidisciplinary approach to entomology, combining taxonomic rigor with ecological insights.

It is characterized by a small body size, with a length under 8 mm, and distinct morphological features, including 1–4 rows of upturned marginal setae on the cheeks. The species exhibits specific abdominal traits, as noted in both descriptions, and unique tarsal (leg segment) features, as highlighted in the second description. Additionally, it possesses notable tail plate characteristics, as described in the first account. These combined features—cheek setae, abdominal and tarsal morphology, and tail plate structure—distinguish *Delia sphaerobasis* from other members of the genus. The species is geographically distributed across northwestern China, occurring in the regions of Xinjiang, Qinghai (specifically the Qilian Niu Xing Mountain), and Inner Mongolia (Ejina Banner). Its habitat range suggests adaptation to arid or semi-arid environments typical of these areas. The taxonomic work by Fan and Qian in 1984 established the species’ classification, emphasizing its morphological uniqueness and regional distribution. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the authorship, year of description, and key diagnostic traits, with the second description adding tarsal features to the first’s focus on abdominal and tail plate characteristics.

The term \"\"type locality\"\" indicates that Wen County is the specific geographic site where *Delia sphaerobasis* was first collected and described by taxonomists, establishing its reference point for scientific classification. Meanwhile, *Pseudonupedia intersecta* is recorded as being present in the area, though its ecological or botanical significance in the region is not elaborated in the provided data. Both descriptions highlight Wen County’s role in biodiversity documentation, particularly within the context of Gansu’s flora and fauna. The absence of conflicting information in the two descriptions allows for a unified summary, emphasizing the county’s dual relevance as a habitat for *Pseudonupedia intersecta* and the origin point for the taxonomic identification of *Delia sphaerobasis*.

These species are linked to the region as part of their geographic range, contributing to local biodiversity and ecological studies. Additionally, Xin Yuan is described as a distribution area for **牛皮蝇** (*niupiying*), a Chinese term commonly used to refer to horn flies, which may include the aforementioned *Eutrichota* species or other related flies in the region. The mention of \"\"牛皮蝇\"\" aligns with the scientific descriptions, suggesting that Xin Yuan plays a role in the habitat or spread of these economically significant pests, which are known to affect livestock. The combination of these details highlights Xin Yuan’s relevance in entomological research, particularly in understanding the ecological dynamics and geographic distribution of fly species in Xinjiang.
