Situated within the broader ecological and geographical context of Jilin, the city has been documented in entomological studies for its association with these insects. *Nodulosa Fannia*, a member of the Fanniidae family, is noted for its presence in the region, likely influenced by local environmental conditions such as climate, vegetation, or human activity. Similarly, *Helina evecta*, a species from the Sarcophagidae family, is also linked to BAIHE, indicating the area's biodiversity and potential role as a research site for dipteran fauna. While the descriptions do not specify the exact ecological interactions or conservation status of these species in the city, their coexistence highlights BAIHE's importance in the study of regional insect populations. The city’s connection to both species underscores its value as a location for scientific observation and ecological analysis, particularly in understanding the distribution and behavior of flies in northeastern China. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both consistently identify BAIHE as a Jilin Province city associated with these two fly species. The summary integrates all available information to present a cohesive overview of the entity’s entomological significance.\",1\n701,XINBIN,\"\n\nXinbin is a city located in Liaoning Province, China, recognized as a significant geographical and ecological site. It is associated with the distribution and presence of several species, particularly within the genus *Helina* and the species *Nodulosa Fannia*. Specifically, Xinbin serves as a habitat for *Nodulosa Fannia*, a fly species documented in the region. Additionally, the city is linked to *Helina evecta*, another fly species, through its ecological association. *Helina latitarsis* and *Helina parcepilosa*, both members of the *Helina* genus, are also reported to be distributed in Xinbin, highlighting the area’s role in supporting diverse fly populations. The descriptions collectively emphasize Xinbin as a location where these species are recorded, underscoring its importance in regional biodiversity studies. While the data does not specify further details about the habitats or ecological roles of these species, the repeated mention of Xinbin in relation to multiple *Helina* species and *Nodulosa Fannia* suggests it is a focal point for entomological research in Liaoning. The city’s inclusion in these records aligns with broader efforts to catalog and understand the distribution of insect species in northeastern China. No contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as all consistently identify Xinbin as a location in Liaoning Province tied to these species. This synthesis confirms Xinbin’s relevance as a site for the presence and study of the mentioned taxa.  \n\n(Word count: 150)\",2\n3120,HUNYUAN,\"\n\n**HUNYUAN** is a location in the Chinese province of Shanxi, recognized as a significant site for entomological research due to its association with multiple species of flies. The area is specifically noted as the type locality for *Phaonia tristroilata*, a species within the genus *Phaonia*, which means it is the geographic reference point where this species was first identified and described. Additionally, HUNYUAN serves as a habitat for *Ph. mimofausta* (a species in the same genus, *Phaonia*), as well as *Helina latitarsis*, a member of the genus *Helina*. These findings highlight the region’s ecological importance in documenting biodiversity, particularly for dipteran species. While the descriptions emphasize different species, they collectively underscore HUNYUAN’s role as a key locality in Shanxi for studying and cataloging these insects. The presence of multiple species in the area suggests a potentially rich or specialized ecosystem, though further research would be needed to confirm broader ecological patterns. The term \"\"type locality\"\" is critical in taxonomy, as it establishes the geographic origin for scientific classification, ensuring clarity in species identification. Thus, HUNYUAN is not only a site of occurrence for these species but also a foundational reference in their taxonomic history. The data provided does not indicate any contradictions, as all descriptions align in identifying HUNYUAN as a Shanxi location linked to these specific fly species. This summary integrates the three descriptions into a cohesive account of HUNYUAN’s entomological significance.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5575,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,PUBLICATION IN ENT.
