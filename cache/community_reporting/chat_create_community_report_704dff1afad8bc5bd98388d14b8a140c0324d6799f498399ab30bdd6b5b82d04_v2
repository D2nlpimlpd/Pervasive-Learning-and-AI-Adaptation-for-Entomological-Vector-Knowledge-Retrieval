The city is associated with multiple **Strobilomyia** species, including **Strobilomyia laricicola**, and has been linked to species descriptions in entomological research. Notably, Yichun is home to the **black-spotted greenbottle fly** (*Hydrophoria zetterstedti*), a species known for its ecological and forensic relevance. Additionally, the city supports the presence of **Stomorhina obsoleta**, a fly species often found in forested or mountainous regions, and **Hylemya partita**, which is typically associated with decaying organic matter. Yichun’s biodiversity also includes **Delia lineariventris**, a species within the Delia genus, and **Acrostilpna latipennis**, a fly noted for its specific habitat preferences. These associations highlight Yichun as a key location in Heilongjiang for documenting and understanding the ecological roles of diverse fly species, particularly those within the Strobilomyia and related genera. The city’s inclusion in species distribution records underscores its importance in regional entomology, serving as a reference point for studies on insect habitats, behavior, and taxonomy. While the descriptions emphasize Yichun’s connection to these species, they collectively reinforce its role as a hub for biological research in the area.\",6\n688,LAPLAND,\"\n\nLapland is a region in northern Sweden, part of the broader Nordic countries and Northern Europe, renowned for its ecological and taxonomic significance in entomology. It serves as the **type locality** for several species, including *Helina longicornis*, *Acrostilpna latipennis*, *Leucophora unistriata*, *Pegohylemyia depressa*, and multiple *Paraprosalpia* species, as well as *Hydrophoria ignobilis* and *Leucophora unilineata*. The region is also documented as the **distribution area** for *Hydrophoria hyalipennis* and *Paraprosalpia moerens*. Additionally, *Chionomyia vetula* is noted as having Lapland as its European type locality, with this documentation attributed to Hennig in 1967. These references collectively highlight Lapland’s role as a critical site for the identification, classification, and study of diverse insect species, particularly within the Diptera order. The region’s unique environmental conditions and biodiversity have contributed to its prominence in scientific records, with multiple species being first described or observed there. While some descriptions emphasize Lapland’s status as a type locality in Europe or Sweden, others focus on its ecological relevance for specific taxa, all converging on its geographical and biological importance. The consistency across sources underscores Lapland’s recognition as a key area for entomological research, with no contradictory claims about its location or associated species. Its designation as a type locality for numerous species reflects its historical and ongoing value in understanding arthropod taxonomy and distribution patterns in the Nordic and European contexts.\",6\n685,HUCKETT,\"\n\nHuckett is an author cited in the description of *Botanophila longifurca* and is also recognized for documenting the North American distribution of *Acrostilpna latipennis* in 1946. These contributions highlight Huckett's role in entomological research, particularly in the study of fly species and their geographical ranges. While the first reference pertains to *Botanophila longifurca*, a species within the Tephritidae family, the second work focuses on *Acrostilpna latipennis*, a member of the same family, underscoring Huckett's expertise in this taxonomic group. The 1946 documentation of *Acrostilpna latipennis* provides a historical baseline for understanding its presence and ecological context in North America. Together, these works illustrate Huckett's involvement in advancing knowledge of tephritid flies, though specific details about the nature of their research on *Botanophila longifurca* remain unspecified in the provided descriptions.
