MOU first described the species *Atherigona yiwulushan* in 1981, marking an early contribution to the field. In the same year, MOU also authored the description of *Lispe monochaita*, collaborating with a researcher named Ma. Over the following years, MOU described or co-described several other species, including *Lispe bivittata subbivittata*, *Lispe hirsutipes* (noted as a new species in one description and co-described in another), and *Lispe argenteiceps*. Additionally, MOU co-authored the description of *Emmesomyia megastigmata* and independently described *Emmesomyia subvillica*. In 1986, MOU described *Phaonia brunneipalpis* and is associated with the journal *动物分类学报* (Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica), a key publication in Chinese taxonomic research. MOU also described *Phaonia beizhenesis* and is credited with the species *Lispe loewi*.

MOU’s research spans both individual and collaborative efforts, with notable partnerships in describing *Lispe monochaita* and *Lispe argenteiceps*. Their work has been published in both English and Chinese scientific literature, reflecting a focus on regional biodiversity and taxonomy. MOU’s contributions highlight expertise in hoverfly systematics, particularly in documenting new species and subspecies, and advancing classification within the 1980s.
