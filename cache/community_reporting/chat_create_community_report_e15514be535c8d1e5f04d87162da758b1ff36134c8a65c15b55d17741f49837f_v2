His work primarily focused on the description of new species and genera within the Diptera order, particularly in the families Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae. HO described the genus *Hoa* in 1937, marking a significant taxonomic contribution. In 1934, he authored the species descriptions of *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*, *Sarcophaga flexuosa*, *Sarcophaga erecta*, and the Chinese *Musca autumnalis* (1393义乌亚麻蝇), the latter of which was also referenced in a 1938 illustration. The same year, he contributed to the illustration or description of *Musca domestica* (housefly) and *Stomoxys sitiens* (stable fly), though specific details about these works remain unclear.  \n\nIn 1936, HO described *Parasarcophaga hui* and the Chinese *Calliphora sinensis* (1399胡氏亚麻蝇), a species he is also credited with documenting in another source. Additionally, he is noted for describing the Red-headed Calliphora (*Calliphora vicina*), though the exact year for this work is unspecified. A 1938 study by HO on *Sarcorohdendorfia seniorwhitei* further highlights his expertise in sarcophagid flies.  \n\nHO’s research spanned both morphological and ecological studies, with a focus on species native to China. His 1934 work on *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata* and the 1932 description of *Parasarcophaga brevicornis* demonstrate his early engagement with parasarcophagid flies. The conflicting years for *Calliphora sinensis* (1934 vs. 1936) may reflect differing sources or a typographical error, but the 1936 reference is more explicitly tied to his authorship.  \n\nOverall, HO’s legacy includes foundational taxonomic work on multiple fly species, with a particular emphasis on the 1930s. His descriptions of *Hoa*, *Parasarcophaga hui*, *Sarcophaga flexuosa*, and *Sarcophaga erecta* remain key references in entomology, alongside his contributions to the understanding of *Musca autumnalis* and *Calliphora* species. The Chinese names 义乌亚麻蝇 and 胡氏亚麻蝇, associated with his 1934 and 1936 studies respectively, underscore his role in documenting regional biodiversity.
