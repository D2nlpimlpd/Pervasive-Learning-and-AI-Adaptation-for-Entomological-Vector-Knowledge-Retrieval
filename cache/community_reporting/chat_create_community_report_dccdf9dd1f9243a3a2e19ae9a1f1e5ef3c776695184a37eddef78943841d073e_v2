It is characterized by distinct morphological features, including 8–9 lower orbital bristles and the presence of small bristles on the dorsolateral scutellum, a region on the dorsal side of the thorax. The species has a body length ranging between 5–7 mm, placing it within the typical size range for members of its genus. Geographically, *Alliopsis curvifemoralis* is known to inhabit the Gedang area of Medog County in Tibet, a region noted for its unique biodiversity. The broader distribution of the species is also associated with Tibet, though specific details about its range beyond Gedang remain limited. The combination of its bristle patterns and geographic location provides key taxonomic markers for identification. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the species' description by Fan and Wu in 1983 and its association with Tibet. The inclusion of the Gedang, Medog locality in the first description adds specificity to its habitat, while the second reinforces the regional context. Together, these details establish a coherent profile of *Alliopsis curvifemoralis* as a Tibetan fly species with distinct anatomical traits.\",6\n1380,ALLIOPSIS HEMILIOSTYLATA,\"A species of fly described by Fan and Wu in 1983, characterized by 8-9 lower orbital bristles, small bristles on the dorsolateral scutellum, and a body length of 5.0-6.5 mm.

It serves as a platform for researchers to disseminate findings on diverse insect species, including both original research and taxonomic descriptions. The journal has featured studies on the species *Servillia planiforceps* and *Tachina nupta*, contributing to the understanding of their morphology, behavior, and ecological roles. Additionally, it has published detailed descriptions of new or previously undocumented species within the genus *Alliopsis*, such as *Alliopsis gigantosternita*, *Alliopsis curvifemoralis*, and *Alliopsis hemiliostylata*. These contributions highlight the journal’s focus on documenting biodiversity and supporting entomological science through rigorous, peer-reviewed research. By addressing both specific case studies and broader taxonomic classifications, the *Entomological Journal of China* plays a key role in expanding knowledge of insect fauna, particularly in the region of China, while also fostering international collaboration in the field.
