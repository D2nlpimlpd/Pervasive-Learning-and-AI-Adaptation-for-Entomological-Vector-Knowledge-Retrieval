The region hosts the **pine caterpillar tachinid fly (松毛虫缅麻蝇)**, which is known to breed in pine caterpillars, a critical ecological interaction for its life cycle. Additionally, Jiangxi is home to **Lucilia hainanensis**, a blow fly species documented in the province’s biodiversity. The **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) idmais**, a parasitic fly, is also distributed domestically in Jiangxi, with the province serving as its type locality—the specific geographic origin where the species was first identified and described. \n\nFurther, Jiangxi is a key habitat for **Pyrellia cyanicolor**, a species noted for its presence in the area. The province also supports the distribution of two closely related tachinid flies: **1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇** (likely a catalogued species with the identifier 1463) and **1465松毛虫狭颊寄蝇** (another tachinid fly, possibly associated with pine caterpillars). These species contribute to Jiangxi’s ecological diversity, particularly in parasitism and predation roles within local insect populations. \n\nAnother notable species, **环斑孟蝇** (a member of the genus *Mengera*), is documented as one of its domestic distribution regions in China. The inclusion of multiple species, such as the pine caterpillar-associated flies and the blow fly *Lucilia hainanensis*, highlights Jiangxi’s role in supporting both specialized and generalist fly populations. The province’s varied ecosystems, including forested areas and subtropical climates, likely facilitate the breeding and survival of these species. \n\nIn summary, Jiangxi is a critical location in China for the study and conservation of diverse fly species, including those with specific ecological niches like parasitizing pine caterpillars or serving as type localities. Its role as a distribution hub for species such as *Parasarcophaga idmais*, *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, and the catalogued tachinids underscores its importance in entomological research and biodiversity monitoring.

The city is also the **type locality** for **Atherigona triglomerata**, meaning it is the specific location where this species was first identified and described. Furthermore, Shanghai is listed as a domestic location in China for **1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇** (a species with a catalog number 1464, likely referring to a taxonomic or collection identifier).

Three species of the genus *Isomyia*—*Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Isomyia oestracea*, and *Isomyia pseudonepalana*—are also documented in the province, contributing to its entomological significance. Furthermore, Anhui is one of the domestic distribution regions for the **Zhejiang Mengfly** (浙江孟蝇) and the **Ring-spotted Mengfly** (环斑孟蝇), both of which are part of the broader Mengfly group.

Notably, the manual includes specific examples such as *Musca chui* and *Musca ventrosa*, two species of flies documented within its pages. These species are highlighted for their ecological or public health significance, likely due to their prevalence in Chinese environments or roles in disease transmission. The publication is structured to facilitate both academic study and practical fieldwork, offering a blend of scientific rigor and accessible identification tools. As a foundational text in Chinese entomology, it reflects the country’s diverse fly fauna and supports efforts in ecological monitoring, agricultural pest management, and medical vector research.
