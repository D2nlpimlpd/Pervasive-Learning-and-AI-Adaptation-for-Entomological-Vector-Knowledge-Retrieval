His work spanned multiple taxonomic groups, including the genera *Emmesomyia* (established in 1917), *Rypellia* (1931), *Cephalispa* (1935), *Lasiopelta* (1928), *Dichaetomyia* (1921), *Xenotachina* (1921), and *Neohelina* (1924). Malloch’s research was published in notable journals such as *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.*, *Zool. Anz. (Leipzig)*, and *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica*.  \n\nHe described numerous species across his career, including *Atherigona oryzae* (1925), *Atherigona tridens* (1928), *Atherigona simplex* (1925), *Atherigona atripalpis*, *Atherigona confusa*, and *612黄髭芒蝇* (1925) and *614裸蹠芒蝇* (1928), the latter two being Chinese-named species. Malloch also documented *Hebecnema affinis* (1921), *Haematostoma austeni*, *Neomyia fletcheri*, *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri* (1919), *Helina hirtifemorata* (1926), *Myospila flavibasis* (1925), *Myospila femorata* (1935), and *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* (1922). Among his most notable works is the first description of *Musca formosana* (1925), commonly known as the Formosan housefly, in the *Zool. Anz. (Leipzig)* journal. He also described *Musca jacobsoni* (1928) and *Haematobia australis* (1932), as well as *Thricops coquilletti* (1920) and *Nupedia fulva* (1934).  \n\nMalloch’s research extended to ecological studies, including a 1927 investigation on fly species in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and a 1927 study on the distribution of *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* in the same region. He contributed to larval ecology research in 1923 and 1929. Additionally, he described species such as *Isomyia pseudolucilia* (1928), *Isomyia cupreoviridis* (1928), *Xenosia tarsalia* and *Xenosia scutellaris* (1935), and *Eutrichota magna* and *Eutrichota labradorensis* (1920). His work on *Dichaetomyia flavocaudata* (1928) and *Dichaetomyia setifemur* (1928) further solidified his expertise in the Dichaetomyia group.  \n\nIn 1930, Malloch described an unnamed species, and in 1935, he documented *Dexopollenia geniculata*. He also named *Tainanina sarcophagoides* (1931) and *Eutrichota magna* (1920). Among his Chinese-named contributions are *黄足璃蝇* (1928) and *半透璃蝇* (1928), as well as *毛股阳蝇* (1926). Malloch’s legacy includes foundational taxonomic work on flies, with his descriptions cited in both Western and Chinese scientific literature.

Morphologically, species in this genus are distinguished by a **slightly forward-projecting frons triangle**, a feature that contributes to their unique head structure. The **frons width** is approximately **1/5 of the head width**, emphasizing a relatively narrow central region of the head. Their **eyes** are notable for having a **height significantly greater than their length**, creating a vertically elongated appearance. Additionally, the **lower half of the eye is distinctly concave**, a characteristic that differentiates them from closely related genera. Beyond head features, CEPHALISPA is also recognized for **distinct wing features**, though specific details about these traits are not elaborated in the provided data. The combination of these head and wing characteristics solidifies their classification within the Coenosiini tribe, which is known for diverse and specialized morphological adaptations among fruit flies. This genus exemplifies the taxonomic complexity of the tribe, with its unique anatomical traits aiding in identification and ecological studies. The emphasis on eye and frons morphology aligns with broader patterns in tephritid flies, where such features often play roles in species recognition and behavior.
