His work spanned multiple genera and species, with notable first descriptions of several taxa. MALLOCH established the genus *Emmesomyia* in 1917 and later described *Cephalispa* in 1935, as well as *Rypellia* in 1931. He also introduced the genus *Xenotachina* in 1921 and the genus *Neohelina* in 1924.  \n\nAmong the species he described are *Atherigona oryzae* (1925), *Atherigona tridens* (1928), and *Atherigona simplex* (1925), as well as *Hebecnema affinis* (1921) and *Bengalia (Eubengalia) emarginata* (1927). MALLOCH was the first to document *Musca formosana* (1925), later known as the Formosan housefly, in the *Zool. Anz. (Leipzig)* journal. He also described *Isomyia cupreoviridis* (1928) in *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.*, *Isomyia pseudolucilia* (1928), *Myospila flavibasis* (1925), and *Myospila femorata* (1935). Additionally, he contributed to the taxonomy of *Dichaetomyia setifemur* (1928), *Dichaetomyia flavocaudata* (1928), *Helina hirtifemorata* (1926), *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri* (1919), *Xenosia tarsalia* and *Xenosia scutellaris* (1935), and *Haematostoma austeni* and *Neomyia fletcheri*.  \n\nMALLOCH’s research extended to ecological studies, including documenting the distribution of *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* in Sulawesi, Indonesia (1927), and publishing works on fly larvae ecology in 1923 and 1929. He was also involved in broader taxonomic efforts, such as classifying *Scathophaga* species in 1935 and contributing to the 1927 study on Sulawesi’s fly fauna. His work on *Eutrichota labradorensis* (1920) and *Eutrichota magna* (1920) further highlights his focus on regional biodiversity.  \n\nSome of his lesser-known contributions include describing *Haematobia australis* (1932), *Musca jacobsoni* (1928), *Tainanina sarcophagoides* (1931), and *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri* (1919). He also authored descriptions for species such as 黑瓣莫蝇 (*Xenosia scutellaris*, 1935) and 毛股阳蝇 (1926), as well as *Chaetolispa* and *Xenolispa* in 1922 and 1923. MALLOCH’s 1930s work included the 1930 study on fly species, the 1932 description of *Haematobiosa austeni*, and the 1935 classification of *Dexopollenia geniculata*.  \n\nHis publications appeared in journals like *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.*, *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica*, and *Zool. Anz. (Leipzig)*, reflecting his international collaboration and influence. MALLOCH’s legacy includes foundational taxonomic work on flies, with his descriptions of *Lasiopelta* (1928) and *FLAVOCAUDATA* (1928) underscoring his role in expanding the understanding of dipteran diversity. Despite some entries listing species without specific years (e.g., *Eutrichota magna*), his active period is well-documented from 1917 to 1935, with a focus on morphological classification and ecological observations.  \n\nIn summary, MALLOCH was a prolific taxonomist whose work significantly advanced the study of flies, particularly in Asia and North America, through the establishment of genera, detailed species descriptions, and ecological research. His contributions remain critical to modern entomology, especially in resolving taxonomic complexities and documenting regional faunas.\",53\n2991,SETIFEMUR DICHAETOMYIA,\"A species of fly with a yellow abdomen, dark fourth and fifth tergites with an orange-yellow terminal margin, and a body length of 6-8 mm.

Morphologically, species in this genus are distinguished by a **slightly forward-projecting frons triangle**, a feature that contributes to their unique head structure. The **frons width** is approximately **1/5 of the head width**, emphasizing a relatively narrow central region of the head. Their **eyes** are notable for having a **height significantly greater than their length**, creating a vertically elongated appearance. Additionally, the **lower half of the eye is distinctly concave**, a characteristic that differentiates them from closely related genera. Beyond head features, CEPHALISPA is also recognized for **distinct wing features**, though specific details about these traits are not elaborated in the provided data. The combination of these head and wing characteristics solidifies their classification within the Coenosiini tribe, which is known for diverse and specialized morphological adaptations among fruit flies. This genus exemplifies the taxonomic complexity of the tribe, with its unique anatomical traits aiding in identification and ecological studies. The emphasis on eye and frons morphology aligns with broader patterns in tephritid flies, where such features often play roles in species recognition and behavior. While the descriptions focus on structural attributes, further research into their biology, distribution, or ecological interactions could enhance understanding of their evolutionary significance within the tribe.
