It has a black or brown base of the front, entirely black legs, and a body length of approximately 6 mm. Its type locality is the Pyrenees (Europe).>\",7\n703,PYRENEES,\"\n\nThe **Pyrenees** is a prominent mountain range in Europe, forming a natural border between France and Spain, and extending into Andorra. It is recognized as a significant geographical and ecological region, serving as a type locality for several species. Specifically, the Pyrenees is the type locality for **Meliniella griseifrons**, a species first described in this area, and for **Delia interflua**, which is also associated with the region as its type locality. Additionally, the Pyrenees is linked to **Delia karasawana**, though the exact nature of this association (e.g., habitat, distribution) is not explicitly detailed in the provided data.  \n\nThe region is further noted as a distribution area for **Enneastigma**, a species whose presence in the Pyrenees is described as \"\"foreign.\"\" This term may imply that Enneastigma is not native to the Pyrenees or that its occurrence there is part of a broader, non-local distribution pattern within Europe. However, the data does not clarify whether this \"\"foreign\"\" designation refers to the species' origin or its ecological integration into the region. Regardless, the Pyrenees is explicitly identified as a site where Enneastigma is found, underscoring its role in the species' geographic range.  \n\nAs a type locality, the Pyrenees holds particular importance in taxonomy for **Meliniella griseifrons** and **Delia interflua**, meaning these species were first scientifically documented in this area. The mountain range’s unique ecosystems, likely shaped by its elevation and location, may contribute to the presence and diversity of such species. The inclusion of multiple species (Meliniella griseifrons, Delia interflua, Delia karasawana, and Enneastigma) in the descriptions highlights the Pyrenees’ ecological significance as a habitat or reference point for entomological and biological studies.  \n\nThe data does not present direct contradictions but requires synthesis to clarify relationships. For instance, while the Pyrenees is the type locality for Delia interflua, it is also described as a \"\"foreign distribution region\"\" for Enneastigma, suggesting the latter’s presence there is either non-native or part of a secondary range. This distinction is resolved by framing the Pyrenees as both a native habitat for some species (e.g., Delia interflua) and a distribution site for others (e.g., Enneastigma), depending on their ecological or taxonomic context.  \n\nIn summary, the **Pyrenees** is a European mountain range with dual roles: it serves as the type locality for **Meliniella griseifrons** and **Delia interflua**, anchoring their scientific classification, while also acting as a distribution region for **Enneastigma** and a habitat associated with **Delia karasawana**. These connections emphasize the Pyrenees’ importance in biodiversity and taxonomy, particularly for the species explicitly tied to its geography. The region’s ecological characteristics likely support the presence of these organisms, though further details on their interactions or conservation status are not provided in the data.\",4\n702,WUSULI SOUTHERN,\"A southern region of Wusuli, associated with the distribution of Meliniella griseifrons.>\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n699,MELINIELLA GRISEIFRONS,SEGUIY,SEGUIY described MELINIELLA GRISEIFRONS in 1923,27\n700,MELINIELLA GRISEIFRONS,PYRENEES,PYRENEES is the type locality for MELINIELLA GRISEIFRONS,11\n703,MELINIELLA GRISEIFRONS,WUSULI SOUTHERN,MELINIELLA GRISEIFRONS is distributed in WUSULI SOUTHERN,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
