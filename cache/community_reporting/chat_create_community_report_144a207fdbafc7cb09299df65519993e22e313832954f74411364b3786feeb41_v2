The genus is characterized by a small body size, red-yellow antennae, and distinct morphological features such as bare compound eyes and a black abdomen marked with white powder bands. Wing venation patterns also serve as a key diagnostic trait for members of this group. Eurysthaea species exhibit host-specific ecological traits, though the exact nature of these relationships remains less detailed in the provided data. The type species of the genus is **Eurysthaea scutellaris**, which anchors its taxonomic classification. Geographically, the genus is distributed across China and Europe, indicating a transcontinental range. These flies are notable for their specialized adaptations, which may include parasitic or predatory behaviors linked to their host specificity. The combination of their unique coloration, antennal pigmentation, and wing structure distinguishes them within the broader fly taxonomy. Further studies on their biology and distribution could clarify their ecological roles and evolutionary relationships.
