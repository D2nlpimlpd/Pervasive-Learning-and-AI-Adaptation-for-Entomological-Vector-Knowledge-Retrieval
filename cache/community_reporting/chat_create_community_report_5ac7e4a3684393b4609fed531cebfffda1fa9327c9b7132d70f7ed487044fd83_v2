It is taxonomically characterized by specific morphological traits that distinguish it from other subfamilies in the family. One of the defining features of *Coenosiina* is the presence of three abdominal notopleural bristles arranged in an equilateral triangle, a key diagnostic criterion for its classification. Additionally, males of this subfamily exhibit a non-narrow frons (forehead region), which further aids in identification. Female *Coenosiina* species are also notable for unique ovipositor traits, though the exact nature of these traits is not detailed in the provided descriptions. \n\nThe subfamily includes at least two tribes: *Lispini* and *Coenosiini*. These tribes represent distinct evolutionary lineages within *Coenosiina*, each with its own set of morphological and ecological adaptations. The inclusion of these tribes underscores the subfamily’s diversity and its role in the broader taxonomy of muscid flies. \n\nWhile the first description broadly categorizes *Coenosiina* as a subfamily of flies, the second provides more precise taxonomic and morphological context by linking it to *Muscidae* and specifying the bristle arrangement, male frons structure, and female ovipositor characteristics. These details align with standard entomological classifications, where such anatomical features are critical for differentiating subfamilies. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they complement each other by combining taxonomic hierarchy with specific diagnostic traits. \n\nIn summary, *Coenosiina* is a subfamily of the *Muscidae* family, distinguished by three abdominal notopleural bristles in an equilateral triangle, a non-narrow male frons, and unique female ovipositor morphology. It encompasses tribes such as *Lispini* and *Coenosiini*, reflecting its taxonomic breadth and evolutionary significance within the group of muscid flies. These features collectively provide a framework for identifying and classifying species within this subfamily, contributing to the systematic study of fly biodiversity.\",9\n2649,YABEI,\"A region in Shanxi, China, associated with Hebecnema alba\",1\n2650,LISPINI,A tribe of flies within the subfamily Coenosiinae,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4682,HEBECNEMA ALBA,HSUE,Hsue described the species Hebecnema alba in 1983,38\n2481,COENOSIINA,PLATYCOENOSIA,Platycoenosia is a genus within the Coenosiinae subfamily,11\n4699,YABEI,HEBECNEMA ALBA,Yabei is a region in Shanxi where Hebecnema alba is found,10\n4710,COENOSIINA,LISPINI,Lispini is a tribe within the subfamily Coenosiinae,10\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
