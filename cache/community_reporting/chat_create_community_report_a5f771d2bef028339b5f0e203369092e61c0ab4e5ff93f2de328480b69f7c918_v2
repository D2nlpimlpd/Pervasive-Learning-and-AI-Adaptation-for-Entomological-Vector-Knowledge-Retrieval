It is the **type locality** for *肃北阳蝇* (a species of fly, likely in the family Muscidae or a related group, though the full scientific name is not provided), meaning this region was the original site where the species was first identified and described by taxonomists. Additionally, Suzhoubei is noted as a **domestic habitat** for *Helina rariciliata*, a species within the genus *Helina* (family Sarcophagidae, flesh flies). This indicates that the area supports a population of *H. rariciliata* within China, contributing to its documented distribution.  \n\nThe dual references to Suzhoubei highlight its role in entomological research, serving both as a critical site for the discovery of new species (*肃北阳蝇*) and as a known location for the presence of *H. rariciliata*. While the descriptions do not specify further details about the ecological characteristics or conservation status of these species, the mention of \"\"type locality\"\" underscores the region’s importance in scientific classification, as type localities are foundational for defining and studying biodiversity. The coexistence of these two species in Suzhoubei may reflect the area’s unique environmental conditions, such as climate, vegetation, or altitude, which are conducive to supporting diverse fly populations.  \n\nNo contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both consistently identify Suzhoubei as a location in Gansu, China, with distinct but complementary roles in the study of these species. The summary integrates the information to emphasize the region’s dual significance in domestic entomology and its contribution to the taxonomic record of *肃北阳蝇*. Further research into the local ecosystem could provide deeper insights into the biodiversity and ecological dynamics of Suzhoubei, potentially revealing additional species or interactions relevant to conservation and scientific understanding.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",1\n3109,武经纬,Wu Jingwei is a collector associated with the type locality of 肃北阳蝇 in Gansu,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5557,肃北阳蝇,MA,Ma is the author who described the species 肃北阳蝇,85\n5559,肃北阳蝇,肃北,\"肃北阳蝇 is distributed in Subei, Gansu\",5\n5560,肃北阳蝇,武经纬,Wu Jingwei collected the type specimen of 肃北阳蝇 in Subei,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
