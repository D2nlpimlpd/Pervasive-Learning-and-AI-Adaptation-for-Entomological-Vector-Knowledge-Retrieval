It serves as the **type locality** for *Eutrichota*, a taxonomic group first described in the region, and for *Caricea mikii*, a plant species that was initially documented there. The country is also recognized as a **distribution site** for several insect species, including *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (a Chinese-named fly species), *Blaesoxipha arenicola*, *Haematobia titillans* (the horn fly), *Musca larvipara* (a parasitic fly), and *Parasarcophaga uliginosa* (a species of flesh fly). These insects are part of Yugoslavia’s broader biodiversity, with some, like *1396犁头亚麻蝇*, being specifically noted for their presence in the region. Additionally, the **genus *Sinonipponia*** is reported to be distributed in Yugoslavia, further highlighting its ecological significance. The *Helicophagella* genus, typically associated with other regions, is also documented as occurring in this foreign country, underscoring its role as a crossroads for diverse species. While some descriptions emphasize that certain species are found in Yugoslavia as part of their **international distribution**, the country’s unique status as a type locality for others suggests it holds specific importance in their taxonomic history. Overall, Yugoslavia’s inclusion in the range of these species reflects its varied habitats and historical contributions to entomological and botanical research. The country’s legacy as a center for scientific discovery is reinforced by its association with both locally endemic and widely distributed organisms, making it a key reference point in studies of these taxa. This synthesis integrates all provided data, resolving any ambiguity by focusing on confirmed distribution and type locality roles without conflicting claims.\",6\n2463,WEST GERMANY,Country where Haematobia titillans is distributed,1\n2473,PARABRONEMA SKRJABINI,,1\n2240,ROMANIA,\"\n\nRomania, a European country, is home to several notable insect species, as documented in the provided data. The country serves as a habitat for **KENT'S SARCOPHAGA**, a species of fly specifically reported in the city of Baia Mare, a location in northern Romania. Additionally, **Haematobia titillans**, commonly known as the horn fly, is distributed across Romania, contributing to its role as a host environment for various fly populations. The presence of **Musca larvipara**, a species of housefly, has also been recorded in the country, further highlighting its ecological diversity. Another fly species, **Parasarcophaga uliginosa**, is found in Romania, indicating the nation's suitability for supporting parasitic or predatory fly genera. Furthermore, Romania is noted as a foreign country where the **Helicophagella genus** is distributed, though specific regional details within the country are not provided. The general statement that \"\"the species is distributed\"\" in Romania aligns with these specific examples, underscoring the country's significance as a biodiversity hotspot for these particular insects. Collectively, these findings emphasize Romania's role in the geographic range of multiple fly species, both in localized areas like Baia Mare and broader regions, while its status as a European nation situates it within a wider ecological and biogeographical context. The descriptions do not present contradictions, as all references to species distribution are consistent with Romania's documented insect fauna.\",4\n2146,GREECE,\"\n\nGreece, a European country located in the southeastern region of the continent, is recognized as a site of distribution for several fly species.

Additionally, *Musca larvipara* (the lesser house fly) is reported in Greece, further highlighting the diversity of fly populations in the region. Notably, Greece also holds foreign distribution records for *Musca crassirostris* (the thick-nosed house fly), indicating that this species, while not native to the area, has been observed or introduced there. These records collectively underscore Greece's role in the geographic spread and presence of various fly species, which may have implications for local ecosystems, livestock management, and public health. The country's Mediterranean climate and geographical position likely facilitate the habitation of such species, though specific ecological interactions or population dynamics are not detailed in the provided data.
