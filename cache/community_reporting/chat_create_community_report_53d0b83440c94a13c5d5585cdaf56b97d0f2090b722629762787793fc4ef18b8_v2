It is situated in the northwest of Russia, bordering Norway to the west and Finland to the south, and is characterized by its Arctic and subarctic climate, as well as its rugged terrain of mountains, forests, and tundra. The peninsula is known for its ecological significance, supporting diverse flora and fauna adapted to its harsh northern environment. Two notable species associated with the Kola Peninsula are the fly *Delia hirtitibia* and the ant *Monochrotogaster unicolor*. *Delia hirtitibia*, a species of hover fly, has its foreign distribution recorded in the Kola Peninsula, indicating its presence in this region as part of its broader range. Similarly, *Monochrotogaster unicolor*, a small ant species, is documented as being distributed across the same area, highlighting the peninsula's role as a habitat for specialized arthropods. The Kola Peninsula’s unique geographical position and environmental conditions make it a critical site for studying the distribution patterns of such species, particularly in the context of historical Soviet-era ecological research and contemporary biodiversity assessments. While the descriptions provided focus on these two species, the region is also notable for its mineral resources and the Kola Superdeep Borehole, a scientific drilling project that explored Earth’s crust. The combination of its Arctic climate, ecological niche, and historical ties to the Soviet Union underscores the Kola Peninsula’s multifaceted importance in both biological and geological studies.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1625,MONOCHROTOGASTER UNICOLOR RINGDAHL,RINGDAHL,RINGDAHL is the author of the species Monochrotogaster unicolor,56\n1628,MONOCHROTOGASTER UNICOLOR RINGDAHL,NOTULAE ENT.,The species is described in the journal,6\n1627,MONOCHROTOGASTER UNICOLOR RINGDAHL,KOLA PENINSULA,The species is distributed in the Kola Peninsula,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
