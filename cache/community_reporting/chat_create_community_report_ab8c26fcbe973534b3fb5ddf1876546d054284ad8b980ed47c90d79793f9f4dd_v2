In 1962, Park described two species: *1339上海细麻蝇* (a species of fly) and *1398拟对岛亚麻蝇*, both documented in Korea. These contributions established his early work in the field of dipteran taxonomy. By 1977, Park expanded his research focus to the distribution of various fly species across different regions of Korea. He was cited in a 1977 Korean study for his work on *Protocalliphora azurea*, a species found in North Korea’s **Neoyan Mountain** (also referred to as **内延山** in Chinese). The same year, Park’s research also addressed the distribution of *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* in Korea, with specific documentation in southern regions. Additionally, he was referenced for his 1977 studies on *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina cuprina* in southern Korea, further highlighting his role in mapping the geographic presence of blowfly species. Park’s work in 1977 spanned both northern and southern parts of the Korean Peninsula, as evidenced by his citations in literature regarding species recorded in **Neoyan Mountain** (North Korea) and unspecified southern locations. His studies were instrumental in providing foundational data on the entomological biodiversity of Korea, particularly for species such as *Protocalliphora azurea*, *Hemipyrellia ligurriens*, and *Lucilia cuprina cuprina*. While his 1962 contributions focused on species identification, his 1977 research emphasized ecological distribution, reflecting a shift toward understanding the geographic and environmental contexts of these insects. Park’s work remains a key reference for entomologists studying Korean fly populations, with his 1977 studies frequently cited in discussions of regional faunal records. The consistency of his citations across multiple studies and regions underscores his credibility and the significance of his findings in both academic and applied entomology. Notably, the use of the Chinese name **内延山** for Neoyan Mountain in some descriptions aligns with the mountain’s historical and geographic nomenclature, though the entity is primarily associated with North Korea in the data. Park’s dual focus on species taxonomy and distribution, combined with his active research in the 1960s and 1970s, positions him as a pivotal figure in early Korean entomological science. His work on *1339上海细麻蝇* and *1398拟对岛亚麻蝇* in 1962, alongside his 1977 studies on *Protocalliphora azurea*, *Hemipyrellia ligurriens*, and *Lucilia cuprina cuprina*, demonstrates a comprehensive engagement with both the classification and ecological mapping of dipteran species in Korea. The data collectively confirm Park’s role as a documented authority on these species, with his 1977 studies being particularly influential in establishing regional distribution patterns. Contradictions in the descriptions, such as references to Neoyan Mountain in both North and South Korea, are resolved by noting that the mountain is located in North Korea, while Park’s 1977 work in southern Korea likely pertains to separate studies or broader regional documentation. Overall, Park’s contributions from 1962 to 1977 provide critical historical insights into Korea’s insect fauna, emphasizing his dual expertise in taxonomy and ecological distribution.\",6\n547,KOREA,\"\n\nKorea, encompassing both North and South Korea, is a country with a diverse distribution of various fly species, as documented by multiple researchers and regional studies. The country hosts a range of blowflies and muscids, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, and the black-spotted greenbottle fly (*Caesar Greenbottle Fly*), which are found across its territory. Notably, *Lucilia sericata* is specifically associated with the Kyonggi region, while *Lucilia bufonivora* is also documented in Gyeongseongbukdo (modern-day Gyeonggi Province). The species *Chrysomya pinguis* is restricted to the southern region, and *Ophyra chalcogaster* is present in the country. Additionally, *Parasarcophaga* species such as *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Parasarcophaga polystylata*, and *Parasarcophaga similis* are distributed in Korea, with *P. polystylata* noted in Jiriwon Village.  \n\nKorea is also home to other muscoid flies, including *Anthomyia illocata*, *Anthomyia koreana*, and *Anthomyia procellaris*, as well as *Blaesoxipha litoralis* and *Fannia canicularis* (commonly known as the common housefly). The genus *Adia* and species like *Calliphora axata* (found in Seoul) are reported in the country, which is described as a \"\"foreign location\"\" for some species, such as *Sarcophaga misera*, *Sarcophaga sericea*, and *Blondelia nigripes*. This terminology likely reflects the species' broader global distribution, with Korea serving as one of their peripheral habitats.  \n\nSeveral lesser-known species are documented in Korea, including *Chirosia albitarsis*, *Horiisca hozawai*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Metopia suifenhoensis*, *PIERRETIACRINITULA*, *Strongyloneura prasina*, *Xenotachina busenensis*, and *Xanthotryxus mongol*. The genus *Dexopollenia* and *Sarcorohdendorfia antilope* are also present, with the latter noted as internationally distributed. In the context of agricultural pests, *Strobilomyia* species affect *Larix koreana* (Korean larch), as studied by 细谷, and *Haematobia irritans* (horn fly) is found in the region.  \n\nJeju Island, a distinct geographical area within Korea, is highlighted as a distribution site for certain species. The country’s southern region is particularly significant, hosting *Phallosphaera amica*, *Sarcosolomonia* species, and *Delia diluta* and *Delia antiqua* (both foreign to Korea). Additionally, *Parasarcophaga* and *Pegomya quadrivittata* are recorded in the southern part. The species *Ph. basalis (Zett.)* and *Protocalliphora azurea* are cited by Park (1977), while *Polleniopsis chosenensis* is associated with the Chosun region (historical name for Korea).  \n\nKorea is further noted as a distribution site for Chinese-named species such as 东方粪泉蝇 (*Oriental Muscina*), 朔粪泉蝇 (*Northern Muscina*), and 肖瘤胫厕蝇 (*Culex-like muscid*), alongside *Muscina* species and *Phaonia fuscata*. The genus *Winthemia* and *Xenotachina busenensis* are also present, though specific localities are not detailed.  \n\nIn summary, Korea serves as a key location for the distribution of numerous fly species, spanning both native and foreign populations. Its regions, including Jeju Island, southern areas, and specific villages like Jiriwon, are critical habitats for these insects, with historical and contemporary records by researchers such as Park and 细谷 contributing to the understanding of their ecological roles and geographic spread. The country’s biodiversity in this context reflects its varied ecosystems and climatic conditions, supporting both common and specialized fly species.

It is a volcanic island situated in the East China Sea, approximately 87 kilometers off the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula. The island is part of Jeju Special Self-Governing Province, which is recognized as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site due to its diverse ecosystems, including lava tubes, waterfalls, and subtropical forests. Jeju Island is also a popular tourist destination, known for its natural beauty, cultural heritage, and active tourism industry.  \n\nA notable scientific reference to Jeju Island is its association with the 1971 study by **Shinonaga et Kano**, which, despite being cited as \"\"Island in Japan,\"\" actually focused on the Korean territory.
