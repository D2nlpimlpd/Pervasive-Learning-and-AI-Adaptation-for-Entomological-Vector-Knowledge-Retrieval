Notable genera present in the region include *Eutrichota* (with Yuzhong as the type locality), *Adia*, *Spallanzania*, *Argyophylax*, *Onesia* (e.g., *Onesia sinensis* and *Onesia gangziensis*), *Mesembrina meridiana meridiana*, *Phormia regina* (found in Sunan and Lanzhou), and *Pseudonupedia intersecta* (specifically in Wen County). Gansu is also the type locality for *Egle anthomyioides* and *Delia sphaerobasis* (type locality in Wen County), and it supports *Delia coarctata* in Qingyang, Tianshui, and Qingshui. \n\nThe province is home to multiple *Helina* species, including *Helina calceataeformis* (Huashan), *Helina quadrum*, *Helina confinis*, and *Helina qilianshanensis* (type locality in the Qilian Mountains). Other species documented in Gansu include *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Tachina nupta*, *Servillia ardens*, *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, *Hylemya probilis*, *Megophyra simpliceps*, *Cuphocera varia*, *Drymeia vicana*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, *Lasiomma curtigena* (Lanzhou, Xinglongshan Xinglongchuan), *Lasiomma graciliapicum* (type locality in Diebu), *Bellardia menechmoides* (Tianshui), *Bercaea cruentata*, *Dasyphora gansuensis*, *Delia gansuensis*, *Hydrotaea jacobsoni*, *Pegomya crinilamella*, and *Paregle audacula*. Additionally, Gansu is a domestic distribution site for *Periscepsia carbonaria* and *Alashan Wohlfahrtia*, as well as the *Wohlfahrtia bella* and *Musca larvipara*. The region is also associated with the *Musca conducens* (a type of housefly) and *Musca sorbens*, with specific mentions of pastoral areas for certain species. \n\nChinese-named species found in Gansu include 紫翠蝇 (Purple Greenbottle Fly), 孟氏翠蝇 (Meng’s Greenbottle Fly), 细角细麻蝇 (a *Phaonia* species), 秉氏亚麻蝇 (Bing’s Picture-wing Fly), 秋家蝇 (Autumn Housefly), and 马粪碧蝇 (Manure Greenbottle Fly). The city of Lanzhou, a major urban center in Gansu, is noted for *Phormia regina* and *Lasiomma curtigena*.

As a major urban center in the region, Lanzhou is situated along the Yellow River and is known for its historical, cultural, and economic importance in northwestern China. The city’s association with these species highlights its ecological relevance in entomological studies. *Parasarcophaga aegyptica*, a parasitoid fly, is documented to inhabit areas within Lanzhou, contributing to local biodiversity and potentially playing a role in pest control or ecosystem dynamics. Similarly, *Lasiomma curtigena*, a species of cicada, is also reported to be distributed in the city, indicating the presence of suitable habitats for its life cycle, such as forests or shrublands. The repeated mention of Lanzhou’s connection to these species across the descriptions underscores its status as a key location for their study and conservation. While the descriptions do not provide specific details about the ecological interactions or population trends of these species, they collectively affirm Lanzhou’s role in their geographic range. The city’s climate, characterized by cold winters and hot summers, and its semi-arid environment may influence the distribution patterns of both organisms. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions consistently identify Lanzhou as a city in Gansu Province, China, and link it to the presence of these species.
