The 1980s marked a prolific period, with **Sinohylemya ctenocnema** and **Sinohylemya craspedodonta** introduced in 1980, followed by **Hebecnema alba** (1983) and **Syllegopterula flava** (1983). In 1981, HSUE documented **Coenosis subflavicornis**, **Hydrophoria ventribarbata**, **Paraprosalpia qinghoensis**, **Pegomya centaureeodes**, and **Servaisia cothurnata**, the latter also in 1978. Additionally, HSUE described **Helina rastrella** in *Acta Entomologica Sinica* and **Phaonia recta** in 1984, along with **Phaonia aureoloides** in the same year. In 1982, HSUE contributed to the taxonomy of **Limnophora interfrons** and **Limnophora latiorbitalis**. Their work spans diverse genera such as *Blaesoxipha*, *Bellardia*, *Sinohylemya*, *Hydrotaea*, *Hydrophoria*, *Paraprosalpia*, *Pegomya*, *Servaisia*, *Limnophora*, and *Phaonia*, with notable species including *craspedodonta*, *ctenocnema*, *recta*, *aureoloides*, and *flava*.
