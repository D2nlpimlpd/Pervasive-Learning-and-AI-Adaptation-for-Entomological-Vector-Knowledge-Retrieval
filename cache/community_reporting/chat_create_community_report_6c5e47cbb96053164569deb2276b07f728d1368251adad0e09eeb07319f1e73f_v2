Distributed in tropical regions.\",8\n460,STEIN,\"\n\nSTEIN was a prominent taxonomist and entomologist active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, known for his extensive contributions to the classification and description of dipteran (fly) species. He established the genus *Enneastigma* in 1916 and described its type species *Nupedia nigroscutellata* in 1920, as well as the genus *Aphananeura* in 1907. Stein also founded the genus *Pseudocoenosia* in 1916 and described *Aphananeura echinata*. His work spanned multiple genera, including *Dichaetomyia*, where he classified species such as *Dichaetomyia pallicornis* (1915), *Dichaetomyia apicalis*, *Dichaetomyia pectinipes*, and *Dichaetomyia pallitarsis*. For the genus *Delia*, he described *Delia nigribasis* (1907), *Delia gracilis* (1907), *Delia planipalpis* (1898), and *Delia hirtitibia* and *Delia angustissima*.  \n\nStein’s research included significant descriptions of species in the *Phaonia* genus, such as *Ph. decussata*, *Ph. rufitarsis* (1907), *Ph. halterata* (1893), and *Ph. tenuirostris* (1907), as well as *Hydrophoria* species like *Hydrophoria maculipennis* (1907), *Hydrophoria cinerascens* (1907), and *Hydrophoria melaena* (1907). He also described *Hydrotaea spinosa* (1907), *Hydrotaea pandellei* (1899), and *Hydrotaea pilipes* (1903). Notable species attributed to him include *Drymeia metatarsata* and *Drymeia spinifemorata* (1907), *Lasiopelta longicornis* (1915 and 1928), *Lispe bivittata* (1909), *Paraprosalpia pilitarsis* (1900), *Coenosia dilatitarsis* (1907), *Leucophora dorsalis* (1916), and *Caricea vernalis* (1907). In 1918, he documented *Caricea boops* in India and *Anthomyia plumiseta*.  \n\nStein’s work extended to species with Chinese names, including *毛足近脉花蝇* (1907), *黑尾缘花蝇* (1908, *Mitt. Zool. Mus. Berlin*), *毛胫厕蝇* (1895), *污瓣莫蝇* (1918), and *毛瓣家蝇* (*Musca inferior*, 1907). He described *Pegohylemyia depressa* (1907, later known as *扁狭泉种蝇*) and *Pegohylemyia profuga* (1916). Additionally, he contributed to the *Pegomya* genus, describing *Pegomya aniseta* (1907) and *Pegomya prominens* (1907), though the 1834 date for *Pegomya geniculata* likely reflects an error.  \n\nStein’s publications appeared in journals such as the *Academy of Sciences of Petersburg*, *Mitt. Zool. Mus. Berlin*, and *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica*. He was also linked to the 1915 description of a species in Taiwan and to the *动物分类学报* (Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy). Among his other works are *Myospila laevis* (1900), *Myospila tenax* (1918), *Ophyra spinigera* (1910), *Ophyra simplex* (1915), *Lasiomma curtigena*, and *Sinochirosia variegata* (1907). Contradictions in the data, such as conflicting years for *Delia planipalpis* (1898 vs. 1907) or *Pegomya geniculata* (1834 vs. 1907), may stem from typographical errors or misattributions, but his active period is consistently tied to the 1890s–1920s.  \n\nOverall, STEIN’s legacy lies in his meticulous documentation of diverse fly taxa, including foundational descriptions of genera and species, and his role in advancing dipteran taxonomy through prolific publications and collaborations. His work remains a critical reference in entomological studies.

It is characterized by a slender rostrum, a morphological feature that distinguishes it from other members of the genus. The species also exhibits a non-forked terminal segment of the lateral tail plate, a key taxonomic trait noted in its classification. Delia gracilis has a body length of approximately 7.5 mm, placing it within the typical size range for flies in this genus. Geographically, it is known to inhabit Qinghai, China, specifically in the regions of Huangyuan and Bulhanbuda Mountain. These habitats likely reflect its ecological preferences, though further details on its behavior or life cycle are not provided in the descriptions. The combination of its slender rostrum, non-forked tail plate structure, and specific geographic distribution in Qinghai underscores its unique identification within the *Delia* genus. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, allowing for a unified summary that integrates all details.\",4\n1241,扁狭泉种蝇,\"\n\n**扁狭泉种蝇** (Pegohylemyia depressa) is a species of fly within the genus *Pegohylemyia*, first described by Stein in 1907. It is characterized by a body length ranging from 4.5 to 6 mm, with a distinct morphological feature being a short and blunt anal plate terminal process, which differentiates it from the closely related *尖扁泉种蝇*. Additionally, *扁狭泉种蝇* lacks small projections on the lateral lobes of the anal plate, a trait that further distinguishes it from other species in the group. The type locality for this species is Qinghai, China, where it was originally identified. While one source notes its distribution as extending to Japan, Europe, and North America, another description emphasizes its primary association with Qinghai. This discrepancy may reflect regional records or taxonomic updates, but the species is definitively documented in Qinghai as its origin and core habitat. *扁狭泉种蝇* is part of the broader *Pegohylemyia* genus, which includes other species with similar ecological or morphological traits. Its classification and distinguishing features are critical for accurate identification within the group, particularly in differentiating it from *尖扁泉种蝇*. The species’ presence in multiple continents suggests a potential for wider dispersal, though further research may clarify its full geographic range. Morphologically, the combination of a short, blunt anal plate and the absence of lateral lobe projections provides a reliable diagnostic marker for entomologists. As a member of the *Pegohylemyia* genus, it contributes to the study of dipteran biodiversity and ecological adaptations in its habitats.\",4\n463,九点花蝇属,\"\n\n九点花蝇属 (Enneastigma) 是一个由 Stein 于 1916 年建立的蝇类昆虫属，属于双翅目（Diptera）。该属的分类特征主要基于雄性个体的形态学差异，例如其侧尾叶呈分叉状，肛尾板则具有心形结构。这些独特的形态特征在蝇类分类学中具有重要意义，有助于区分九点花蝇属与其他近缘属。  \n\n九点花蝇属的地理分布范围主要集中在古北界的南部和东部地区。古北界是世界生物地理分区中的一个主要区域，涵盖欧洲、亚洲北部及非洲北部，而该属的具体分布可能包括中国、日本、韩国以及中亚部分地区。这一分布模式反映了其对温带至亚热带气候的适应性，同时也与古北界东部的生态多样性密切相关。  \n\n作为蝇类分类中的一个独立属，九点花蝇属的建立基于对雄性形态的详细研究，这在昆虫分类学中较为常见，因为许多蝇类的性别二态性显著，雄性特征常被用作分类依据。Stein 的原始描述为后续研究提供了基础，但该属的分类学研究仍需进一步补充，例如对雌性形态、幼虫特征及分子系统学数据的整合，以更全面地理解其分类地位和演化关系。  \n\n目前，关于九点花蝇属的生态习性、寄主关系及物种多样性研究相对有限。未来的研究可结合形态学与分子生物学方法，探索其在生态系统中的功能，以及与其他蝇类属的亲缘关系。此外，该属的分布范围可能随新标本的发现而扩展，需持续关注古北界及邻近地区的调查数据。  \n\n综上，九点花蝇属是一个以雄性形态特征为分类核心的蝇类属，其分布与古北界东部的地理环境紧密相关。尽管已有初步分类框架，但更深入的研究仍有助于完善其分类学信息和生态学认知。\",3\n2809,PSEUDOCOENOSIA,\"\n\n**PSEUDOCOENOSIA** is a genus of flies within the family Tachinidae, first established by the entomologist Stein in 1916. The genus is characterized by distinct morphological features that aid in its identification. Notably, the frons triangle—a triangular region on the face—extends to the frontal clypeus, a structure at the base of the face near the mouthparts. This feature differentiates *Pseudocoenosia* from closely related genera. Additionally, the antennae of species in this genus are relatively shorter compared to other tachinid flies, with setae (bristles or fine hairs) that reach the tip of the antennae, contributing to their sensory and structural adaptations. Another defining trait is the presence of a pair of strong preapical dorsocentral bristles, which are located on the thorax and serve as key diagnostic markers for the genus.  \n\nThe type species of *Pseudocoenosia* is *Pseudocoenosia solitaria*, which was designated as the representative species to anchor the genus classification. This species, like others in the genus, exhibits the aforementioned morphological traits, providing a foundational reference for taxonomic studies. The genus is part of the broader Tachinidae family, known for its parasitoid lifestyle, where larvae develop inside host insects before emerging as adults. While specific ecological or behavioral details about *Pseudocoenosia* species are not provided in the descriptions, their structural adaptations suggest roles in host detection and parasitism typical of tachinid flies.  \n\nThe descriptions are consistent in defining *Pseudocoenosia* as a taxonomic group with unique anatomical features and a historical classification by Stein. No contradictions exist between the two provided details, as one focuses on taxonomy and the other on morphology. Together, they establish the genus as a well-defined entity within dipteran taxonomy, emphasizing its morphological distinctiveness and historical context.

It is specifically noted for the formal description of the species *Delia diluta* by the entomologist Stein in 1916, as well as for recording information about *Delia hirtitibia*. These entries highlight the journal’s role in entomological research, serving as a repository for taxonomic and ecological data on insects, including members of the genus *Delia*. While the descriptions provided focus on two distinct species, they collectively underscore the journal’s contribution to the scientific classification and study of such organisms. The lack of additional context about the journal’s scope or publication history suggests it may be a specialized or historical resource, with its entries on *Delia* species reflecting its utility in documenting biodiversity and species-specific characteristics. The journal’s name, translating to \"\"Archive of Natural History,\"\" implies a broader focus on natural science, though the examples given emphasize its relevance to entomology. Both *Delia diluta* and *Delia hirtitibia* are likely related to the same taxonomic group, and their inclusion in ARCH.NATURGESCH. indicates the journal’s role in advancing knowledge about their morphology, distribution, or behavior. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they reference different species within the same publication. Overall, ARCH.NATURGESCH. appears to be a scholarly work that has contributed to the understanding of these *Delia* species, with Stein’s 1916 description of *Delia diluta* marking a specific milestone in its content. The journal’s historical significance is further reinforced by its documentation of *Delia hirtitibia*, though the exact details of this entry remain unspecified. Together, these references establish ARCH.NATURGESCH. as a resource for entomological studies, particularly in the context of species within the *Delia* genus.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",2\n1101,近脉花蝇ENGYNEURA SETIGERA,,2\n1402,EUTRICHOTA (EREMOMYIA),A subgenus of Eutrichota described by Stein in 1898,2\n1451,PEGOMYA PROMINENS,\"A species of fly described by Stein in 1907, found in Xinjiang, Qinghai (Qilian Mountains, type locality), with a red abdomen and distinctive tail lobe morphology\",2\n1814,WEST PACIFIC ISLANDS,\"\n\nThe **West Pacific Islands** are a group of regions in the western Pacific Ocean where the **Thick Ring Black Fly** (*Ophyra spinigera*) is known to be distributed. This species, also referred to internationally as *Ophyra spinigera*, is found across these islands, which are recognized as part of its global habitat. The descriptions collectively highlight that the West Pacific Islands serve as a significant ecological and geographical range for the Thick Ring Black Fly, emphasizing its presence in both local and international contexts. The term \"\"foreign region\"\" in the first description may imply that the West Pacific Islands are not the fly's native origin but rather a location where it has established populations, while the second description underscores its widespread occurrence in the area. Together, these points confirm the West Pacific Islands as a key region for the species' distribution, bridging local and international ecological relevance.

It is associated with the distribution of the fly species *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, which is documented in this region as part of its known range. Additionally, JIJI is cited as a location in Taiwan (notably, the term \"\"Taiwan, China\"\" in the second description is geographically imprecise, as Taiwan is a separate territory with complex political status; the correct reference is to Taiwan itself) where the fly *Helina lateralis* has been observed. The area also holds importance as the **type locality** for the species *Lasiopelta longicornis*, a term in taxonomy indicating the specific geographic location where the first specimen of a species was collected and described. \n\nThese associations highlight JIJI’s role as a site of biodiversity interest, particularly for dipteran (fly) species. The presence of *Dichaetomyia quadrata* and *Helina lateralis* suggests that the region supports habitats conducive to their life cycles, though specific ecological details about these species in JIJI are not provided in the descriptions. The designation of JIJI as the type locality for *Lasiopelta longicornis* underscores its historical and scientific value in the classification of this species, which is likely a beetle given the genus name *Lasiopelta* (a group within the family Chrysomelidae). \n\nWhile the descriptions do not clarify whether these species coexist in the same microhabitats within JIJI or if their associations are based on separate studies, the cumulative data position JIJI as a focal point for research on insect distribution and taxonomy in Taiwan. The mention of multiple species across different taxonomic groups (*Dichaetomyia* and *Helina* as flies, *Lasiopelta* as a beetle) indicates a diverse local fauna, though further ecological context would be needed to fully understand the interrelationships or conservation status of these species in the area. \n\nIn summary, JIJI in Taichung, Taiwan, is a location with documented ties to three distinct insect species: *Dichaetomyia quadrata* (fly), *Helina lateralis* (fly), and *Lasiopelta longicornis* (beetle), serving both as a distribution site and a type locality. Its role in scientific literature reflects its contribution to understanding regional biodiversity, though the descriptions provided lack detailed environmental or temporal context for these associations.\",2\n2617,\"ANN, MUS, NAT.
