His work spanned multiple genera and species, with notable activity between 1903 and 1936. In 1903, he described the species *Calliphora rohdendorfi*. By 1927, he had introduced the subspecies *Myospila meditabunda brunettiana*. In 1928, Enderlein described several key taxa, including the subgenus *Ascelotella* and the species *Ascelotella formosana*, as well as the genus *Helicophagella* and *Robineauella*. The same year, he also established the synonym *1340杯细麻蝇* (likely a Chinese transliteration of a species name) and synonymized the genus *Agria*. Additionally, he described the subgenus *Thyrsocnema*, though this is sometimes conflated with *Ascelotella* in the data.  \n\nIn 1934, Enderlein expanded his taxonomic work by describing the genus *Stenomitra* and the species *Neomyia sumatrana*. He also authored the 1934 publication *Atelia* in the *Annals and Magazine of Natural History*. By 1935, he introduced the genus *Mitroplatia* (or *Miltroplatia*, as noted in the data). In 1936, he described the genus *Proteremoplax* and the species *Silbomyia hoeneana*.  \n\nEnderlein’s research also involved synonymizing genera and species. He is credited with establishing synonyms for *Pierretia*, including *Mehria* and *Ascelotella*, though the exact relationship between these names requires clarification. His work on *Ascelotella formosana* in 1928 and the subsequent synonymy of *Ascelotella* under *Pierretia* suggests a dynamic approach to taxonomic revision.  \n\nDespite some inconsistencies in the data (e.g., the dual mention of *Mitroplatia* and *Miltroplatia* in 1935, and the repeated references to *Helicophagella* and *Robineauella* in 1928), Enderlein’s legacy is marked by his meticulous descriptions of dipteran genera and species, as well as his role in refining taxonomic classifications through synonymy. His publications, such as *Atelia* and the 1928 works on *Ascelotella* and *Helicophagella*, remain foundational in entomological literature.  \n\nEnderlein’s contributions highlight his expertise in both morphological taxonomy and the historical consolidation of fly classifications, reflecting the evolving nature of scientific nomenclature during his era. His work on genera like *Proteremoplax*, *Stenomitra*, and *Robineauella* underscores his influence in systematizing Diptera, while his 1936 description of *Silbomyia hoeneana* and 1934 work on *Neomyia sumatrana* further demonstrate his global reach in studying diverse fly species.  \n\nIn summary, Enderlein was a pivotal figure in early 20th-century entomology, with a focus on dipteran taxonomy. His career included the establishment of multiple genera and species, the resolution of taxonomic conflicts through synonymy, and the publication of key works that advanced the understanding of fly classification. His efforts in 1928 and 1934–1936 were particularly prolific, cementing his reputation as a dedicated and influential taxonomist.\",23\n4798,HELICOPHAGELLA,A genus of flies characterized by specific morphological features like dense spines on the fifth abdominal plate and a smooth phallus in males,5\n5062,ASCALOTELLA FORMOSANA,,4\n2632,MYOSPIRA MEDITABUNDA BRUNETTIANA,\"A subspecies of Myospila meditabunda described by Enderlein in 1927, distributed in China (Liaoning, Shandong, Hubei, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Yunnan) and parts of Southeast Asia.\",3\n5038,THYRSOCNEMA,,3\n4844,ROBINEAUELLA,,2\n2337,STENOMITRA,A genus of flies described by Enderlein in 1934,1\n4794,HEUCOPHAGELLA,Helicophagella is a genus in the Sarcophagini tribe described by Enderlein in 1928,1\n5030,MEHRIA,\"亚属, established by Enderlein in 1928\",1\n5040,ADDED SUBGENUS,,1\n5057,ASCALOTELLA,\"A subgenus of flies described by Enderlein in 1928, distinguished by elongated epandrium and paired membrane-like projections with strong sclerotization\",1\n5215,叉麻蝇属ROBINEAUELLA,\"A genus of large flies established by Enderlein in 1928, including species like Sarcophaga scoparia\",1\n5900,PROTEREMOPLAX,A genus of flies described by Enderlein in 1936,1\n3553,SILBOMYIA HOENEANA,\"A species within the Silbomyia genus, characterized by yellow cheek bristles, specific bristle patterns, and a distribution in China.
