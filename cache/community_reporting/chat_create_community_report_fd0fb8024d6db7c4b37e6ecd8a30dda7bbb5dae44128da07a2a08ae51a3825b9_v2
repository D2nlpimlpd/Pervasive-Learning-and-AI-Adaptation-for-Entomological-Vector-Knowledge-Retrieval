In 1956, QIU FENGYI played a role in the formal description of several fly species, advancing the taxonomic understanding of this group of insects. Their work during this period is notable for its focus on morphological and ecological characteristics, which are critical for species identification and classification. One specific example of QIU FENGYI's involvement is their reference in the scientific description of *Musca cassara*, a species within the fly family. While the exact nature of their contribution to *Musca cassara* is not detailed in the provided descriptions, their inclusion in this context suggests they provided data, observations, or expertise that supported the species' characterization. The broader 1956 work implies a systematic effort to document multiple fly species, likely through field research, specimen analysis, or collaborative studies. Together, these descriptions highlight QIU FENGYI's role as a researcher who contributed to the taxonomic framework of flies, with a documented association to *Musca cassara*. The information does not present contradictions but rather underscores their engagement in both general and specific entomological studies.
