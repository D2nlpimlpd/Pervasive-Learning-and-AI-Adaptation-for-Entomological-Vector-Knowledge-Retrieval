The information is consistent across sources, with no contradictions requiring resolution.\",14\n6204,1965年HEBEI报告,Report on Chrysomya megacephala in Hebei published in 1965,2\n2376,北非,\"\n\n北非（North Africa）是非洲北部的一个地理区域，涵盖多个国家，包括摩洛哥等。该地区是多种生物物种的分布区，尤其在昆虫学领域具有重要研究价值。根据现有数据，北非是滨边小蝇（Schoenomyza litorella）的分布区域之一，这种蝇类可能以该地区为原生地或次生分布区。此外，黑斑翠蝇（Neomyia (Scutellorthellia) lauta）也广泛分布于北非，其范围明确包括摩洛哥，表明该物种在这一区域具有显著的生态适应性。蓝色原皮蝇（Protocalliphora azurea）同样以北非为其分布范围的一部分，进一步凸显该地区在昆虫多样性中的地位。  \n\n值得注意的是，部分描述提到北非是“某些物种分布的外国地区”，这可能指一些物种并非原生于北非，而是通过自然扩散或人为活动引入的。例如，某些蝇类可能因气候条件适宜而在此形成次生种群，或与国际交流相关而扩展至该区域。同时，北非也被描述为“国际物种分布的区域”，说明其地理位置可能成为连接欧洲、亚洲与非洲的生态桥梁，部分物种在此呈现跨区域分布特征。  \n\n综合来看，北非既是多种蝇类的原生栖息地（如黑斑翠蝇），也是部分物种的非原生分布区（如可能的滨边小蝇和蓝色原皮蝇）。这一矛盾可通过物种迁移或生态适应性解释，例如气候变化、人类活动或与其他地区的生态联系可能促进物种扩散。摩洛哥作为北非的典型国家，其境内记录的黑斑翠蝇分布进一步佐证了该地区的生态重要性。北非的生物地理特征使其成为研究物种分布动态、生态适应性及跨区域生态交流的关键区域。  \n\n（字数：248）\",3\n2175,宁夏,\"\n\nNingxia, officially the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is a region in China known for its diverse entomological fauna. It serves as a domestic distribution location for several fly species, including *Exorista rossica*, *Protocalliphora azurea*, *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa*, and *Dialyta halterata*, as documented in sources such as *动物分类学报* (Acta Zoologica Sinica). The region is also associated with the presence of *Rypellia*, specifically in the counties of Jingyuan and Guyuan, according to Zhao’s 1981 research. Additionally, populations of *Musca vitripennis* (glasswinged housefly) have been recorded in Ningxia. Notably, the area is the domestic distribution site of the *Helanshan European fly* (贺兰山欧麻蝇), a species linked to the Helan Mountains within the region.  \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to Ningxia as a \"\"province,\"\" it is officially an autonomous region, a distinction reflecting its unique administrative status within China. The mention of \"\"province\"\" in certain sources likely stems from colloquial or outdated terminology. Ningxia’s ecological significance is underscored by its role as a habitat for these diverse fly species, which span both native and potentially invasive taxa. The presence of *Exorista rossica* and *Protocalliphora azurea* highlights its importance in the study of parasitic and predatory flies, while *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa* and *Dialyta halterata* contribute to understanding regional biodiversity. The documentation of *Rypellia* in Jingyuan and Guyuan, along with *Musca vitripennis*, further emphasizes Ningxia’s varied ecosystems and their capacity to support specialized insect populations. The *Helanshan European fly* adds to this list, tying the region’s fauna to its geographical features, such as the Helan Mountains.  \n\nIn summary, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a key area in China for the distribution of multiple fly species, including both common and regionally significant taxa. Its status as an autonomous region, rather than a province, is critical to its administrative and ecological context. The region’s entomological records, spanning scientific literature and historical studies, illustrate its role in broader biological and taxonomic research. Specific localities like Jingyuan and Guyuan are highlighted for their contributions to the documented presence of *Rypellia*, underscoring the need for localized ecological studies. Despite minor inconsistencies in terminology (e.g., \"\"province\"\" vs. \"\"autonomous region\"\"), the data collectively affirm Ningxia’s importance as a hub for fly biodiversity in China.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",5\n2825,阿富汗,\"\n\nAfghanistan (阿富汗) is a landlocked country located in South and Central Asia, bordered by Pakistan to the east and south, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to the north, and China to the far northeast. It is a nation with a complex history, marked by periods of conflict and political instability, and is known for its rugged terrain, including the Hindu Kush mountain range. The country has a diverse ecosystem, ranging from arid deserts to fertile river valleys, which supports a variety of flora and fauna.  \n\nAfghanistan is a country where the insect species *Schoenomyza litorella* is distributed and has been reported to be present. *Schoenomyza litorella*, a species of fly, is documented within Afghanistan’s ecological framework, indicating its adaptation to the region’s environmental conditions. The presence of this species contributes to the understanding of Afghanistan’s biodiversity, though detailed ecological studies or population assessments of *Schoenomyza litorella* remain limited due to the country’s geopolitical challenges.  \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent, both confirming the existence of *Schoenomyza litorella* in Afghanistan. No contradictions exist between the two statements, as they reinforce the same biological fact. The summary integrates the entity name (阿富汗) and the insect species’ presence, contextualizing it within Afghanistan’s geographical and ecological profile. While the data does not specify the species’ role in the ecosystem or its interactions with local agriculture or wildlife, it underscores Afghanistan’s inclusion in the global distribution of *Schoenomyza litorella*.  \n\nIn summary, Afghanistan (阿富汗) is recognized as a region where *Schoenomyza litorella* is found, adding to the documentation of its insect biodiversity. The country’s unique geography and climate likely play a role in supporting this species, though further research is needed to fully characterize its ecological significance in the area.\",2\n2826,黎巴嫩,\"\n\nLebanon (黎巴嫩) is a country in the Middle East where the insect species *Schoenomyza litorella* is known to be distributed. Scientific records confirm the documented presence of this species within Lebanon's territory, highlighting its ecological occurrence in the region. The information provided aligns to establish that *Schoenomyza litorella* is not only present in Lebanon but also has a recognized distribution pattern there, as evidenced by prior documentation. This synthesis integrates both descriptions to reflect the confirmed status of the species in the country.\",2\n2827,非洲热带区,Tropical Africa is a region where Schoenomyza litorella is distributed,1\n2828,新北区,\"\n\nThe **New North District (新北区)** is a biogeographic region within the broader Nearctic realm, which encompasses most of North America. It serves as a habitat for certain species, including the fly *Schoenomyza litorella*, whose distribution is documented in this area. The New North District is also described as a \"\"foreign region\"\" in the context of species distribution, suggesting it lies outside the typical range for some organisms, potentially acting as a marginal or extended habitat. This dual characterization implies that while the district is part of the Nearctic biogeographic framework, its ecological or geographic conditions may differ from core regions, influencing the presence or rarity of specific species. The term \"\"foreign region\"\" likely refers to its relative isolation or distinct environmental features compared to other areas within the Nearctic, rather than a contradiction in its classification. The New North District’s role in biodiversity highlights its significance as both a native and peripheral zone for various taxa, underscoring regional ecological variability. (Word count: 150)\",1\n2829,新热带区,Neotropical is a biogeographic region where Schoenomyza litorella is distributed,1\n2034,土耳其,\"\n\nTurkey is a country in Southeastern Europe and Southwestern Asia, known for its diverse ecosystems and as a distribution area for several insect species. Among these, the **Atherigona soccata** (a species of fly) is documented as being present in Turkey, contributing to its ecological and entomological significance. Similarly, the **Protocalliphora azurea**, a species of bot fly, is also reported to inhabit the region, aligning with Turkey's role as a crossroads for various migratory and resident insect populations. The **Schoenomyza litorella**, a type of shore fly, is explicitly noted as distributed in Turkey, further highlighting its coastal and wetland habitats. Additionally, the term \"\"简莫蝇\"\" (likely a Chinese transliteration for a specific fly species, possibly *Schoenomyza* or a related genus) is mentioned as being part of Turkey's distribution area, though the exact species classification may require further clarification. Lastly, Turkey is identified as a foreign distribution site for the species \"\"1287肿额潘麻蝇\"\" (translated as \"\"1287 Swollen-headed Panma Fly,\"\" potentially a catalogued or locally named species), underscoring its role in hosting a range of fly species with varying ecological niches. Collectively, these references emphasize Turkey's importance as a biodiversity hotspot for flies, particularly in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, and its position as a bridge between European and Asian faunal regions. The inclusion of species with both scientific and Chinese common names suggests a focus on entomological research or agricultural pest management contexts, where Turkey's geographic and climatic diversity supports a wide array of insect life. The mention of \"\"1287\"\" in one description may indicate a catalog number or a misinterpretation of a species name, but it is retained here to reflect the data provided. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as all consistently identify Turkey as a shared distribution area for these species. This summary consolidates the information to present Turkey as a key location for the presence of multiple fly species, contributing to regional ecological studies and pest monitoring efforts.\",5\n6165,高景铭,\"\n\n高景铭（Gao Jingming）是一位与中国河北省昆虫学研究相关的学者，其主要贡献集中在1965年对两种重要蝇类物种的调查与报告。根据现有记录，高景铭在1965年主导或参与了两项关于河北省蝇类的研究：一是对**Musca larvipara**（大头金蝇）的专项报告，二是作为共同作者参与了关于**Chrysomya megacephala**（绿头蝇）的研究。这两项研究均聚焦于河北省的昆虫生态分布或相关科学问题，可能涉及农业害虫防治、生态学分析或法医学应用等领域。  \n\n尽管两项研究均标注为1965年，但具体角色存在差异。第一项描述明确指出他“**conducted**”（主导）了Musca larvipara的报告，表明其可能是该研究的主要负责人或独立作者；而第二项描述则强调他作为“**co-author**”（共同作者）参与了Chrysomya megacephala的研究，说明该报告可能由多人合作完成，高景铭在其中承担了部分研究或撰写工作。这种差异可能源于研究性质的不同（如独立研究与合作项目），或其在不同研究中的分工侧重。  \n\nMusca larvipara和Chrysomya megacephala均为法医学和生态学中常见的研究对象，尤其在尸体分解过程中的昆虫群落分析中具有重要意义。高景铭的研究可能为当时中国昆虫分类学、生态分布图谱或相关应用领域提供了基础数据。由于两份报告均未提及具体研究内容或成果细节，其学术影响尚需结合更多历史文献进一步考证。  \n\n综上，高景铭在1965年通过独立研究和合作项目，对河北省的两种关键蝇类进行了系统性调查，体现了其在昆虫学领域的专业能力与多维度参与。这些早期研究可能为后续区域昆虫学研究奠定了基础，但其具体方法、结论及后续应用仍需更多资料佐证。  \n\n（Word count: 198）\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1756,棘叶泉种蝇,MEIGEN,Meigen described 棘叶泉种蝇 in 1826,124\n11331,ZENILLIA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus *Zenillia* in 1830,120\n5543,棕翅阳蝇,ZETTERSTEDT,Zetterstedt is the author who described the species 棕翅阳蝇,66\n11171,BOTHRIA,RONDANI,Rondani described the genus Bothria in 1856,65\n5046,FALLEN,滨芦蝇SCHENOMYZA LITORELLA,Fallen described the species Schoenomyza litorella in 1823,56\n7771,青原丽蝇PROTOCALLIPHORA AZUREA,黑龙江,The species is distributed in Heilongjiang province,49\n3433,欧洲,简莫蝇,简莫蝇 is distributed in Europe,31\n7796,青原丽蝇PROTOCALLIPHORA AZUREA,王林瑶,Wang Linyao studied the parasitic behavior of this species' larvae in sparrows,28\n7797,青原丽蝇PROTOCALLIPHORA AZUREA,新疆军区,Xinjiang Military District conducted a survey on this species,28\n7798,蓝原丽蝇PROTOCALLIPHORA CHRYSORRHOEA,吉林,The species is distributed in Jilin province,27\n3435,简莫蝇,LOEW,Loew described the species 简莫蝇 in 1857,20\n10897,1462灰腹狭颊寄蝇,北京,\"1462灰腹狭颊寄蝇 is distributed in Beijing, China\",20\n4462,闾山芒蝇,山东,Atherigona yiwulushan is distributed in Shandong Province,18\n5516,甘肃,\"INSECT CLASSIFICATION JOURNAL, 11(4) :329, FIG.5\",This publication describes a species found in Gansu,18\n5900,甘肃,\"PH,AUREOLICAUDA MA ET WU\",该种分布于甘肃,16\n11984,河北,1965年HEBEI报告,The 1965 report on Chrysomya megacephala was conducted in 河北,16\n5056,北非,滨芦蝇SCHENOMYZA LITORELLA,Schoenomyza litorella is distributed in North Africa,14\n3636,MUSCA VITRIPENNIS,宁夏,The species *Musca vitripennis* is distributed in Ningxia Province,13\n5051,阿富汗,滨芦蝇SCHENOMYZA LITORELLA,Schoenomyza litorella is distributed in Afghanistan,13\n5054,黎巴嫩,滨芦蝇SCHENOMYZA LITORELLA,Schoenomyza litorella is distributed in Lebanon,13\n5057,非洲热带区,滨芦蝇SCHENOMYZA LITORELLA,Schoenomyza litorella is distributed in Tropical Africa,12\n5058,新北区,滨芦蝇SCHENOMYZA LITORELLA,Schoenomyza litorella is distributed in the Nearctic region,12\n5059,新热带区,滨芦蝇SCHENOMYZA LITORELLA,Schoenomyza litorella is distributed in the Neotropical region,12\n3434,土耳其,简莫蝇,简莫蝇 is distributed in Turkey,10\n11938,高景铭,MUSCA LARVIPARA,高景铭 conducted a 1965 report on the species Musca larvipara,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
