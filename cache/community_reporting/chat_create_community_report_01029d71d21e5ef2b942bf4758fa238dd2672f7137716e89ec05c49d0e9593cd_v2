The region is associated with the presence of *Aplomyia* and *Bothria* genera, as well as species such as *Lucilia shenyangensis*, *Protocalliphora azurea*, and *Phorbia fascicularis*. Among the flies documented in Heilongjiang are *Delia lineariventris*, *Hypoderma diana* (冕形泉种蝇), and *Calliphora baicalensis* (贝加尔欧麻蝇), alongside the *Neomyia (Orthellia) laevifrons* (大洋翠蝇), which is specifically noted in cities like Harbin and Aihui. The province also hosts *Parasarcophaga* species, including *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa*, *Parasarcophaga (Jantia) crassipalpis*, and *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) dux*, as well as *Phallocheira minor* and *Sarcophila rasnitzyni*. \n\nHeilongjiang is a key habitat for *Hypoderma* species, with *Hypoderma lineatum* (牛皮蝇) and *Hypoderma diana* (冕形泉种蝇) explicitly cited as domestic distribution sites. The province is also linked to the *Gasterophilus* genus, a group of bot flies, through the work of researcher Zhu Yanpeng, who has studied their distribution. Additionally, it is home to *Onesia variola* and the *1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇* (a species with a catalog number or local identifier). The region supports the *长叶绿蝇* (likely a Chinese name for a green flesh fly species) and *苦荬泉种蝇* (another *Hypoderma* species, possibly *Hypoderma sp.*). \n\nThese findings highlight Heilongjiang’s ecological significance as a biodiversity hotspot for flies and parasitic insects, with its cold-temperate climate and varied landscapes contributing to the presence of both common and regionally specific species. The inclusion of multiple *Parasarcophaga* subgenera and *Hypoderma* species underscores the province’s role in the study of dipteran taxonomy and distribution. Researchers and entomologists, including Zhu Yanpeng, have further emphasized its importance in understanding the life cycles and habitats of these insects, particularly in urban and rural areas like Harbin and Aihui. The province’s status as a distribution site for over a dozen distinct species, including those with scientific and local designations, reflects its integral position in China’s entomological landscape. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",22\n6110,鹿皮蝇,\"鹿皮蝇 (Hypoderma diana) is a fly species with larvae that parasitize deer and elk.
