It is home to *Ph.splendida Hennig* and *Ph.sytschevskajae Hennig*, two fly species documented within its borders. The country is also associated with the distribution of *Exorista rossica*, a species linked to its historical status as part of the Soviet Union. In the East Pamir region, *Eutrichota pamirensis*, a fly species, is specifically recorded. Additionally, Tajikistan functions as a foreign distribution area for *Hypoderma sinense*, a bot fly, and *高山泉种蝇* (a high-altitude spring fly species), with the latter having its type locality in Tajikistan, marking it as the origin point for its foreign distribution records. \n\nThe country hosts *Dasyphora* species, a genus of flies, and is a key location for *亚非鼻狂蝇* (African and Asian nose bot fly), with specific distribution noted in Stalinabad (modern-day Dushanbe). Furthermore, Tajikistan is identified as a foreign distribution site for *长端欧麻蝇* (a European bot fly species), reflecting its role as a geographical boundary for certain insect populations. These records highlight Tajikistan’s ecological importance as a crossroads for both native and introduced species, particularly in high-altitude regions like the Pamirs. The data underscores the country’s historical ties to Soviet-era entomological studies and its contemporary relevance in understanding the biogeography of these insects. All descriptions align with Tajikistan’s role as a documented habitat for these species, with no contradictions requiring resolution. The summary integrates information on species distribution, regional specificity, and historical context to provide a cohesive overview of Tajikistan’s entomological significance.\",4\n3285,PH.SPLENDIDA HENNIG,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2188,帕米尔叉泉蝇,HENNIG,Hennig described the species Eutrichota pamirensis in 1972,70\n2191,帕米尔叉泉蝇,东帕米尔,East Pamir is the specific region in Tajikistan associated with Eutrichota pamirensis,7\n7812,山伏蝇属PHORMIATA,东帕米尔,The genus is distributed in eastern Pamir,7\n5911,塔吉克斯坦,PH.SPLENDIDA HENNIG,该种分布于塔吉克斯坦,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
