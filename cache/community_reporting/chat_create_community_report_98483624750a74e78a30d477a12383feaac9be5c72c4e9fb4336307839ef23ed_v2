Their work spanned multiple regions, including India, Europe, North America, and South America, with a focus on blowflies, parasitic species, and myiasis-related research.  \n\nIn the 1920s, Senior-White collaborated with **Patton** to describe the species *Musca seniorwhitei* in 1922 and *Musca fletcheri* in 1924. They also described the genus *Paradichosia* in 1923, including *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Burmanomyia beesoni* (1924), as well as *Sarcophaga futilis*, the type species of the *Iranihindia* genus. Notably, they documented *Sarcophaga kempi* (1924) and *Harpagophalla kempi* (1924), and contributed to the description of *Tainanina pilisquama* in 1925. Additionally, they described *松毛虫缅麻蝇* and *盘突缅麻蝇* in 1924, and *1394叉形亚麻蝇* in 1927, though the latter’s nomenclature may require further clarification due to non-Latin script.  \n\nBy the 1940s, Senior-White expanded their research to ecological and distributional studies. They authored a 1940 study on parasitism in *Nonagria sp.* and bovine myiasis, and documented the distribution of the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly (*Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina*) in South America. They also studied the distribution of *Rhinia apicalis* and *Stomorhina lunata* in 1940, as well as the species *1397卡西亚麻蝇* in the same year. Their work on *Pollenia* species larval hosts in Europe and North America, and the genus *Calliphora* in India (Khasi and Garo Hills), highlights their global scope. Senior-White co-authored *Isomyia pseudonepalana* (1940) in *Fauna Brit, India, Dipt.* and was cited for species distribution data across multiple countries, including India.  \n\nSenior-White’s taxonomic contributions include the 1923 description of *Caiusa testacea* (later reclassified under *Sarcophaga*), and their 1924 study on *Bengalia bezzii*. They also explored differences between dipteran species in 1940, underscoring their role in clarifying taxonomic boundaries. While one entry references a 1910 description of specimens in various regions, the majority of their documented work aligns with the 1920s and 1940s, suggesting this earlier reference may be an error or unrelated to their primary contributions.  \n\nTheir research was frequently associated with type localities in India and Australia, and they were cited in ecological studies of *Borbororhina pubescens* (1940) and *Lucilia cuprina*. Senior-White’s work remains foundational in understanding the taxonomy and biogeography of blowflies and parasitic flies, with species such as *Sarcophaga ostindicae* (1924) and *I. euidielloides* (1923) reflecting their detailed focus on regional faunas.  \n\nIn summary, Senior-White was a key figure in dipteran entomology, with a career marked by collaborative species descriptions, ecological investigations, and distributional analyses across diverse geographic and taxonomic contexts. Their legacy is preserved in multiple publications from 1922 to 1940, emphasizing their dedication to advancing the understanding of fly species and their roles in ecosystems and veterinary science.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",42\n3706,变丽蝇属,\"变丽蝇属 (Paradichosia) is a genus of flies characterized by black or entirely black eyes with dense powder coating, variable coloration, yellow legs, and specific morphological features in male and female reproductive structures.
