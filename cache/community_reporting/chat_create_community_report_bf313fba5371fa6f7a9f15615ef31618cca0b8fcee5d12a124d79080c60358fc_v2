It was first described by the entomologist Fan in 1988, as documented in taxonomic literature. The species is native to China, with specific records indicating its presence in Zhejiang Province, a region in eastern China known for its diverse ecosystems. While one description refers to it as a \"\"species of Eutrichota,\"\" the other broadly identifies it as a \"\"species of fly,\"\" both align in confirming its classification within the fly order Diptera and its association with the genus *Eutrichota*. The genus *Eutrichota* is characterized by its parasitoid lifestyle, as many of its members are known to lay eggs on or in host insects, particularly caterpillars. *Eutrichota gigas* likely shares these ecological traits, though specific details about its behavior, host preferences, or life cycle are not provided in the given data. The species’ discovery in Zhejiang Province highlights the region’s significance as a biodiversity hotspot for tachinid flies, which play critical roles in natural pest control. No contradictions exist in the provided descriptions, as both confirm the species’ taxonomic placement and geographic origin. Further research may be required to elaborate on its morphology, distribution, or ecological impact beyond the current information.\",3\n1396,TIANMUSHAN,\"\n\nTianmushan is a mountain located in Zhejiang Province, China, and serves as a significant ecological and taxonomic site for various fly species. It is recognized as the **type locality** for *Eutrichota gigas*, a species whose classification and distribution are anchored to this specific location. Additionally, Tianmushan is associated with the presence of *Achoetandrus rufifacies*, a fly species documented in the region. The mountain is also a **distribution site** for the 1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly, a species likely cataloged under a specific taxonomic system, and *Atherigona triglomerata*, another fly species found in the area. \n\nTianmushan’s biodiversity extends to the *Muscidae* family, with the mountain noted as a location where subfamilies of this group are distributed. Specific species linked to the site include *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis*, a member of the blowfly genus *Lucilia*, and *Isomyia pichoni* and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, both of which are part of the *Isomyia* genus. The *Lispe quaerens* fly is also documented as being distributed in Tianmushan. Furthermore, the mountain is the **domestic distribution site** for the *Xinglong Hemp Fly* (兴隆亚麻蝇), a species native to China. \n\nWhile one description incorrectly identifies Tianmushan as a \"\"city,\"\" the majority of sources consistently classify it as a **mountain**, resolving this contradiction. The mountain’s role as a hub for fly species highlights its ecological importance in the region, particularly for entomological research. Its association with multiple species across different genera and subfamilies underscores its value as a reference point for studying insect biodiversity in Zhejiang Province. \n\nIn summary, Tianmushan is a mountain in Zhejiang, China, renowned for its role as a type locality for *Eutrichota gigas* and as a distribution site for numerous fly species, including *Achoetandrus rufifacies*, the 1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis*, *Isomyia pichoni*, *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Lispe quaerens*, and the *Xinglong Hemp Fly*. These associations position Tianmushan as a critical location for understanding the taxonomy, ecology, and geographic range of flies in the region.
