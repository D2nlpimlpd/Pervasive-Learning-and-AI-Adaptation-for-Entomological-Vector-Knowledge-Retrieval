It is distributed in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and the Soviet Union (Tajikistan).\",5\n776,TAJIKISTAN,\"\n\nTajikistan, a landlocked country in Central Asia, is recognized as a significant region for the distribution and study of various fly species, both in its current national context and historically as part of the Soviet Union. The country is explicitly cited as the type locality for **Phormiata phormiata**, a species first described from this area during the Soviet era. Additionally, Tajikistan serves as the type locality for the genus **Dinemomyia**, associated with the presence of **Helicophagella rohdendorfi** in the same Soviet Union region. Similarly, **Paregle aterrima** is noted to have its type locality within Tajikistan during the Soviet period.  \n\nIn terms of current and documented distributions, Tajikistan is home to several fly species, including **Sarcophaga variegata**, **Helina calceataeformis**, **Dasyphora apicotaeniata**, **1279膨端折麻蝇** (a Chinese-named species likely corresponding to a local Sarcophaga species), **Phaonia mimobasiseta**, **Azelia zetterstedti**, **Phaonia hybrida**, **Helina parcepilosa**, and **Phaonia fuscata**. These species span multiple genera and ecological roles, reflecting the country’s diverse habitats. The mention of **肖瘤胫厕蝇** (another Chinese-named species, possibly a Phaonia or related genus) further underscores Tajikistan’s role in entomological research, particularly for flies with regional or endemic significance.  \n\nThe historical references to the Soviet Union highlight that some species were first identified from areas now part of Tajikistan, emphasizing its long-standing importance in taxonomic studies. For example, **Azelia zetterstedti** and **Paregle aterrima** are explicitly tied to the Soviet Union’s geographical framework, which later became the modern nation of Tajikistan. This dual context—both as an independent country and as a former Soviet republic—provides a layered understanding of its ecological and scientific relevance.  \n\nTajikistan’s inclusion in the distribution records of these species suggests it harbors a range of environments suitable for diverse fly populations, from lowland regions to mountainous terrains. The presence of multiple Phaonia species (e.g., **Phaonia mimobasiseta**, **Phaonia hybrida**, **Phaonia fuscata**) indicates a notable biodiversity within this genus in the region. Furthermore, the country’s role as a type locality for genera like **Dinemomyia** and species such as **Phormiata phormiata** underscores its historical contribution to global entomology.  \n\nIn summary, Tajikistan is a Central Asian country with both contemporary and historical significance in the study of fly species. It hosts a variety of documented distributions, including **Sarcophaga variegata**, **Helina calceataeformis**, **Dasyphora apicotaeniata**, **1279膨端折麻蝇**, **Phaonia mimobasiseta**, **Azelia zetterstedti**, **Helicophagella rohdendorfi**, **Paregle aterrima**, **Phaonia hybrida**, **Helina parcepilosa**, **肖瘤胫厕蝇**, and **Phaonia fuscata**, while also serving as the type locality for **Phormiata phormiata**, **Dinemomyia**, and **Paregle aterrima**.
