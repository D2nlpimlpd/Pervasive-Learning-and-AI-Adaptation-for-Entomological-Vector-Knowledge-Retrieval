It is closely related to the genus *Pyrellia*, sharing taxonomic proximity but distinguished by unique morphological traits. The defining characteristic of *EUDASYPHORA* is the presence of triangular posterior spiracles, a feature critical to its classification and differentiation from other genera in the family. Additional morphological features further set it apart, though specific details of these traits are not elaborated in the provided descriptions. As a taxonomic group, *EUDASYPHORA* represents a distinct lineage within the dipteran family, reflecting Townsend’s contributions to the systematic study of these insects. Its relationship to *Pyrellia* underscores the evolutionary or ecological connections between these genera, while the emphasis on spiracle shape highlights the importance of anatomical specialization in their identification.
