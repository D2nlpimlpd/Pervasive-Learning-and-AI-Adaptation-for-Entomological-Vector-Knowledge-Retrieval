It hosts a diverse array of flies, including the **Pygophora respondens**, **Dinemomyia nigribasicosta** (specifically in Chiang Mai), **Kanomyia bangkokensis**, and multiple **Musca** species such as *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, and *Musca crassirostris* (with foreign distribution records). The **Dichaetomyia** genus is notably well-represented, with species like *Dichaetomyia luteiventrus*, *Dichaetomyia aureomarginata*, *Dichaetomyia apicalis*, *Dichaetomyia flavocaudata*, *Dichaetomyia pallicornis*, and *Dichaetomyia quadrata* documented internationally in Thailand. Additionally, the **Star Island Greenbottle Fly** and **Indian greenbottle fly** are reported in the country, alongside **Hydrotaea affinis**, **Hypopygiopsis infumata**, **Hypopygiopsis tumrasvini**, **Neomyia ruficornis**, **Haematobia minuta**, **Hemipyrellia liguriens**, **Isomyia cupreoviridis**, **Leucomyia cinerea**, and **Anthomyia illocata**. \n\nThailand also serves as a foreign distribution site for species such as the **hairy-petaled housefly** (毛瓣家蝇) and the **Yunnan and Yiwu flies** (云南亚麻蝇、义乌亚麻蝇), indicating its role in the global range of these insects. The **Stomorhina** genus is present in Thailand, with multiple species recorded there. Furthermore, the **Linnaemya** genus and the **Onesia** genus are associated with Thailand’s biodiversity. Specific species like **1397 Kasia fly** (卡西亚麻蝇) and **1393 Yiwu fly** (义乌亚麻蝇) are noted as part of its foreign distribution records, while **Myospila argentata** and **Lasiopelta** species are also documented. \n\nThe country’s ecological significance is underscored by the presence of 1397 and 1393 species, as well as repeated references to \"\"the species\"\" being distributed or found in Thailand, likely highlighting its role as a hotspot for entomological diversity. These records collectively emphasize Thailand’s importance in the study of fly species, both native and internationally distributed, across various genera and habitats. Its Southeast Asian location and varied ecosystems contribute to the coexistence of such a wide range of taxa, making it a critical area for biodiversity research. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",29\n2869,PYGOPHORA RESPONDENS,\"\n\n**Pygophora respondens** is a species of fly first described by Walker in 1859 and formally documented in the *Zoology* journal of the Linnean Society of London. The species is characterized by a yellow abdomen, a feature highlighted in multiple descriptions, and distinct lateral abdominal spots, as noted in one account. Its antennal segments are also described as yellow, adding to its morphological identification. The bristle patterns on the abdomen, another key diagnostic trait, are mentioned as specific but not further detailed in the provided data.  \n\nGeographically, **Pygophora respondens** is distributed across several regions. It is found in **Xinjiang, China**, as reported in one source, and extends internationally to **Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and other Pacific islands**, according to a broader distribution list. This suggests the species has a range spanning parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia, as well as the Pacific.  \n\nThe species has been illustrated in scientific literature, with a notable depiction by **Snyder in 1965**, which likely aids in its taxonomic identification. While the original description by Walker focused on abdominal features, subsequent references emphasize the combination of coloration (yellow abdomen and antennae) and structural traits (lateral spots, bristle patterns) to distinguish it.  \n\nIn summary, **Pygophora respondens (Walker, 1859)** is a fly species recognized for its yellow abdomen, lateral abdominal spots, and yellow antennal segments, with a specific bristle pattern. It is native to **Xinjiang, China**, and has a wider distribution across **Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and other Pacific islands**. The species was first described by Walker in 1859 and later illustrated by Snyder in 1965, contributing to its taxonomic history.
