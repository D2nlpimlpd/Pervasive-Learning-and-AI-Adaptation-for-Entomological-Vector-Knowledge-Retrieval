It is explicitly mentioned as part of the distribution range for **Dichaetomyia bibax**, a species within the fly family. Additionally, Zhejiang hosts the **pine caterpillar parasitic fly** (松毛虫缅麻蝇), which is specifically noted to breed in pine caterpillars, highlighting its ecological role in the region. The province is also home to species such as **Lucilia sinensis** and **Lucilia shenyangensis**, both belonging to the blowfly genus *Lucilia*, which are likely associated with decomposition or forensic contexts.  \n\nFurther, Zhejiang is identified as a distribution site for three *Isomyia* species: **Isomyia pseudolucilia**, **Isomyia oestracea**, and **Isomyia furcicula**, which are parasitic flies often linked to avian hosts. The **Protocalliphora azurea**, a species of bot fly, is also documented in the province, as is **Cocytodes coerulea**, a member of the *Cocytodes* genus. The **Pyrrellia cyanicolor**, a fly species, is explicitly stated to inhabit Zhejiang, contributing to its entomological diversity.  \n\nIn terms of more specific or cataloged species, Zhejiang is a domestic location for three *Chrysomya* species: **1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇** (Chrysomya gray-powdered narrow-cheeked flesh fly), **1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇** (Chrysomya gray-bellied narrow-cheeked flesh fly), and **1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇** (Chrysomya Sumatran narrow-cheeked flesh fly), though the numerical prefixes may indicate catalog or taxonomic identifiers. The province is also a distribution area for **Zhejiang *Megaselia*** (浙江孟蝇) and **ring-spotted *Megaselia*** (环斑孟蝇), both part of the *Megaselia* genus, which includes small, often parasitic or saprophagous flies. Additionally, **sparsely spotted *Megaselia*** (疏斑纹蝇) is noted as a species found in Zhejiang.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Zhejiang’s role as a significant ecological hub for multiple fly species, including parasitic, predatory, and decomposer varieties. These species are associated with diverse habitats, such as pine forests (for the pine caterpillar parasitic fly) and broader ecosystems supporting blowflies, bot flies, and other dipterans. The presence of both widely distributed genera (e.g., *Lucilia*, *Isomyia*) and regionally specific species underscores the province’s importance in entomological studies. While some entries use scientific names and others rely on Chinese terminology, the data aligns in confirming Zhejiang as a shared or primary distribution area for these organisms. The summary integrates all provided information, resolving any ambiguity by treating each species as distinct unless explicitly linked. This highlights Zhejiang’s contribution to China’s rich insect biodiversity and its relevance in ecological and taxonomic research.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",17\n5494,浙江富阳亚林所,\"Zhejiang Fuyang Sub-forestry Institute, associated with Algedonia coclesalis Walker and researcher Xu Tiansen\",2\n5496,余有森,Individual associated with the entity 稻苞虫 in Zhejiang,1\n5495,徐天森,Researcher at Zhejiang Fuyang Sub-forestry Institute linked to Algedonia coclesalis Walker,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10466,浙江,浙江富阳亚林所,Zhejiang Fuyang Sub-forestry Institute is located in Zhejiang Province,19\n10467,浙江,余有森,Yu Yousen is associated with Zhejiang Province in the context of rice stem borer studies,18\n10470,浙江富阳亚林所,徐天森,Xu Tiansen is a researcher at Zhejiang Fuyang Sub-forestry Institute,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
