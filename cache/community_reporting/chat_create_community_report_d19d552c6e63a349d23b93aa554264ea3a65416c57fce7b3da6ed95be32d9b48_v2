It is documented as a domestic region where the genus *Adia* is found, as well as the species *Musca seniorwhitei*, *Zenillia dolosa*, *Servillia planiforceps*, *Metoposisyrops scirpophagae*, *Calythea setifrons* (specifically in Zunyi), *Limnophora guizhouensis*, *Linnaemya* species, *Hebecnema fumosa*, *Gonia chinensis*, *Haematobia*, *Brontaea tonitrui*, *Siphona boreata*, and *Stomorhina obsoleta*. Additionally, Guizhou is noted as a distribution area for *Limnophora prominens* and *Limnophora exigua*, both of which are part of the *Limnophora* genus. The province is also associated with the domestic occurrence of *Zicui Fly* (紫翠蝇) and *Changban Feces Fly* (长板粪泉蝇), the latter specifically recorded in Zunyi. \n\nGuizhou’s role in entomological studies is further highlighted by its connection to the Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing, which references the province as part of its domestic regional focus. The presence of these diverse species, including both common and regionally specific flies, underscores Guizhou’s ecological importance in the study of dipteran fauna. The province’s varied habitats likely contribute to the wide range of documented distributions, from the *Calythea setifrons* in Zunyi to the *Brontaea tonitrui* and *Siphona boreata* across broader regions. While some descriptions emphasize Guizhou as a general distribution area for certain species, others specify localities such as Congjiang, indicating localized biodiversity hotspots. \n\nThe data collectively confirm Guizhou as a key location for multiple fly species, with both broad and localized records. The inclusion of scientific names, Chinese characters, and regional specifics (e.g., Zunyi, Congjiang) ensures a comprehensive understanding of the province’s entomological significance. No contradictions are present in the descriptions, as all consistently identify Guizhou as a distribution site for the listed species and genera, either generally or in specific cities. This summary integrates all provided information into a cohesive overview of Guizhou’s role in the ecological and taxonomic context of these flies. \n\n(Word count: 200)\",28\n806,HYDROPHORIA RURALIS,,18\n800,BUGUANG MEDICAL COLLEGE,Buguang Medical College conducted surveys related to Hydrophoria ruralis distribution,1\n801,ZUNYI MEDICAL COLLEGE,Zunyi Medical College conducted surveys related to Hydrophoria ruralis distribution,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4236,GUIZHOU,FAN,Fan is cited for domestic distribution data of Haematobia in Guizhou,323\n923,HYDROPHORIA RURALIS,JILIN,Hydrophoria ruralis is distributed in Jilin,143\n917,BUGUANG MEDICAL COLLEGE,GUIZHOU,Buguang Medical College conducted surveys in Guizhou,29\n918,ZUNYI MEDICAL COLLEGE,GUIZHOU,Zunyi Medical College conducted surveys in Guizhou,29\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
