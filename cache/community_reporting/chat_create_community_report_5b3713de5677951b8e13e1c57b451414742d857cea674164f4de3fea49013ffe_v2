The species is characterized by distinct morphological features, including a head width that is 1.5 times the diameter of the frontal ocellus (a small, simple eye-like structure on the forehead) and four times the width of the gena (the area between the eye and the base of the antennae). Its body length measures approximately 6.5 millimeters, providing a key metric for identification. The taxonomic description event, which formally established the species, was conducted by Schnabl in the same year, 1915, as noted in both provided descriptions. \n\nGeographically, *Hydrophoria fasciculata* is known to inhabit the region of Heilongjiang in China, specifically in the area of Wuying. This information aligns across the descriptions, confirming its presence in this location. The species’ name and classification remain consistent in the data, with no contradictory details reported. \n\nIn summary, *Hydrophoria fasciculata* is a 6.5 mm-long fly species distinguished by its head proportions relative to the frontal ocellus and gena, first documented by Schnabl in 1915 and native to Wuying, Heilongjiang, China.
