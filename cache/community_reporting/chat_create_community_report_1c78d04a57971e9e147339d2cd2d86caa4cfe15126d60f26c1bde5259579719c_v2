It serves as a reference tool for entomologists, researchers, and students, providing detailed taxonomic information, ecological roles, and geographic ranges of these insects. The manual emphasizes species that are prevalent in China, offering insights into their habitats, behaviors, and interactions with the environment, while also extending its scope to include related species observed abroad for comparative analysis. Among the species referenced in the manual are *Azelia zetterstedti* and *Azelia fengi*, which are highlighted for their distinct morphological traits and ecological significance. *Azelia zetterstedti* is noted for its specific distribution patterns and adaptations, while *Azelia fengi* is described in the context of its role within Chinese ecosystems. The publication integrates scientific data with practical field observations, ensuring a thorough understanding of fly biodiversity and taxonomy. By consolidating information on both domestic and international species, the manual bridges regional and global perspectives, supporting research and conservation efforts. Its structure likely includes illustrated keys, species profiles, and distribution maps to aid accurate identification and study. The inclusion of *Azelia* species underscores the manual’s commitment to documenting lesser-known or regionally significant taxa, contributing to the broader field of dipterology. Overall, the *CHINESE COMMON FLY SPECIES MANUAL* is a vital resource for advancing knowledge of fly species, with a dual focus on China’s rich entomological diversity and its connections to global fly populations.\",34\n2202,MUSCA HERVEI VILLENUEVE,\"A species of fly described by Villeneuve in 1922, known for laying stalked eggs on fresh cow dung and acting as an intermediate host for Thelazia nematodes in Japan\",28\n2368,BECHSTEIN ET SCHAFENBERG,Authors of the species Musca cornicina,1\n2212,JXIANGXI,A Chinese province where Musca autumnalis is distributed,1\n3920,LONG CLUSTER VARIANT BEAUTY FLY PARADICHOSIA VANEMDENI,\"A species of fly described by Kurahashi in 1970, distinguished by long abdominal bristle clusters and distributed in Yunnan, China and northern Burma\",3\n2211,BURMA,\"\n\n**Summary:**  \nBurma, a country in Southeast Asia, is recognized as a region of significant entomological diversity, hosting a range of fly species across multiple genera. It is home to *Musca convexifrons*, as well as other *Musca* species such as *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, and *Musca seniorwhitei*, which are part of the broader *Musca* genus distributed in the area. Additionally, the country is inhabited by the Chinese-named species 紫翠蝇 (Purple Greenbottle Fly), a common name for a blow fly often associated with the *Musca* genus, though its exact taxonomic classification may require further clarification.  \n\nBurma also serves as a key location for the international distribution of the genus *Dichaetomyia*, which includes species found globally but with notable presence in the region. The Long Cluster Variant Beauty Fly, *Paradichosia vanemdeni*, is another species documented in the country, contributing to its unique biodiversity. Furthermore, the geographical area of Southeast Asia where Burma is situated supports the distribution of *Lasiopelta longicornis*, a species within the *Lasiopelta* genus.  \n\nThese findings highlight Burma’s role as a hub for diverse fly populations, spanning both endemic and internationally distributed species. The coexistence of multiple *Musca* species, along with specialized genera like *Dichaetomyia* and *Paradichosia*, underscores the ecological complexity of the region. While some descriptions reference specific species, others emphasize broader taxonomic groups, collectively illustrating the country’s importance in the study of dipteran fauna. The inclusion of 紫翠蝇 (Purple Greenbottle Fly) adds a culturally specific example to the list, though its scientific nomenclature aligns with the *Musca* genus in most references.  \n\nBurma’s position in Southeast Asia, combined with its varied ecosystems, likely supports the habitats required for these species to thrive. The data collectively affirm the country’s status as a critical area for entomological research, offering insights into both local and global fly populations. Efforts to resolve taxonomic ambiguities, such as the precise classification of 紫翠蝇, could further enhance understanding of Burma’s ecological contributions to dipteran diversity.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",5\n2366,SULAWESI,\"\n\nSULAWESI, an island in Indonesia, is a biologically significant region known for its unique biodiversity.

Additionally, the island is the type locality for *Pygophora respondens*, another species whose classification and nomenclature originate from this location. Beyond these scientific designations, Sulawesi is also home to the species 紫翠蝇 (*Zicuiying*), a local name for an organism documented within its ecosystems. These references highlight Sulawesi’s role as a critical site for entomological and taxonomic research, contributing to the understanding of regional and global biodiversity. The island’s distinct geographical and ecological characteristics likely support the presence of these species, underscoring its importance in conservation and biological studies.
