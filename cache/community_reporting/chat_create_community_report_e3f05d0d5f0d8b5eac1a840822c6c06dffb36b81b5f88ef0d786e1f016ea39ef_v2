These species include **Phaonia villana**, a member of the Sarcophagini family, which is explicitly noted as part of the international regions referenced in the taxonomic key for this group. Additionally, North Korea is identified as a distribution location for **1395巨亚麻蝇** (a Chinese-named species, likely *Paralucilia sp.* or a related genus), **1398拟对岛亚麻蝇** (another Chinese-named species, potentially *Paralucilia similis* or a similar taxon, with Daegu as its type locality), **Calliphora vomitoria** (a blowfly species), **Miltogramma iberium** (a hoverfly), **Musca bezzii** (a housefly variant), **Musca sorbens** (a black fly species), and **Ophyra spinigera** (a flesh fly). The country is also associated with the distribution of **朱乙 (Zhu Yi)**, a species name that may correspond to a local or regional taxonomic designation, and the **THICK RING BLACK FLY**, a descriptive common name for an unspecified species.  \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to North Korea as a \"\"foreign country\"\" or \"\"international region,\"\" this likely reflects the context of global distribution records rather than a contradiction. The repeated emphasis on its role in fly species distribution suggests it is a significant, albeit underreported, location in entomological studies. The inclusion of both scientific and Chinese/local names (e.g., 1395巨亚麻蝇, 1398拟对岛亚麻蝇) highlights the diversity of species documented there, though further taxonomic clarification may be needed for non-Latin names. Notably, the type locality for 1398拟对岛亚麻蝇 is specified as Daegu, a city in South Korea, which could indicate a regional focus or potential overlap in species classification between North and South Korea.  \n\nIn summary, North Korea is recognized as a habitat for a range of fly species, including both widely studied genera like *Calliphora* and *Musca* and less commonly referenced taxa. Its inclusion in taxonomic keys and distribution lists underscores its ecological relevance in the study of dipteran biodiversity, despite limited accessibility due to political factors.
