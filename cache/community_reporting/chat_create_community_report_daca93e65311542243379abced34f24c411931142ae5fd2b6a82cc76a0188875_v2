This species is distributed across two continents: **China** and **Europe**, indicating a wide geographic range that spans both Eastern Asia and parts of the Old World. As a member of the *Lispe* genus, it is likely a hoverfly (family Syrphidae), a group known for their mimicry of bees and wasps, though specific ecological or behavioral traits of *Lispe consanguinea* are not detailed in the provided data. The species’ binomial name, *Lispe consanguinea*, reflects its taxonomic classification within the genus *Lispe*, which is characterized by small to medium-sized flies often associated with flowering plants. The description by Loew in 1858 establishes its historical recognition in scientific literature, and its presence in both China and Europe highlights its adaptability to diverse habitats. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they align on the taxonomic details and geographic distribution. Further research may be required to elaborate on its life cycle, diet, or role in ecosystems, but the core information confirms its status as a well-documented species within the *Lispe* genus.\",6\n2771,LISPE HIRSUTIPES,,3\n2796,LISPE,\"\n\nLISPE is a genus of flies belonging to the Muscidae family, first described by the entomologist Latrellle. This taxonomic group is characterized by its larvae, which possess distinctive wing-like projections and posterior spiracles that lack long, curved slits—a feature that differentiates them from other related genera. The genus includes several recognized species, such as *Lispe hirsutipes* and *Lispe pygmaea*, among others, which contribute to its taxonomic diversity. As members of the Muscidae family, LISPE species are likely to share general traits with other muscids, such as their role in ecological systems as decomposers or potential interactions with human environments, though specific behavioral or ecological details of LISPE are not provided in the descriptions. The morphological features of the larvae, particularly the absence of curved slits in the posterior spiracles, are critical for distinguishing LISPE from closely related genera within the family. The inclusion of species like *Lispe hirsutipes* and *Lispe pygmaea* highlights the genus’s variability in size and physical adaptations, with \"\"pygmaea\"\" suggesting a diminutive form. Overall, LISPE represents a defined taxonomic group within the Muscidae family, notable for its unique larval anatomy and the presence of multiple species, including those explicitly named in the data.\",12\n2799,LISPE LITOREA,\"A species of fly described by Fallen in 1825, part of the Lispe genus\",2\n2800,LISPE BIVITTATA,\"A species of fly described by Stein in 1909, part of the Lispe genus\",2\n2801,LISPE BIVITTATA SUBBIVITTATA,A subspecies of Lispe bivittata described by Mou,2\n2802,LISPE ORIENTALIS,\"A species of fly described by Wiedemann in 1830, part of the Lispe genus\",2\n2798,LISPE QUADERNS,\"A species of fly described by Villeneuve in 1936, part of the Lispe genus\",1\n6121,LATRELLLE,A person who described the genus Lispe,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5012,LISPE PYGMAEA,FALLEN,Fallen is the author who described the species Lispe pygmaea,47\n4943,GERMANY,LISPE CONSANGUINEA,Lispe consanguinea is distributed in Germany,40\n5001,LISPE HIRSUTIPES,LISPE,Lispe hirsutipes is a species within the Lispe genus,15\n5003,LISPE,LISPE PYGMAEA,Lispe pygmaea is a species within the Lispe genus,14\n5005,LISPE,LISPE LITOREA,Lispe litorea is a species within the Lispe genus,14\n5006,LISPE,LISPE BIVITTATA,Lispe bivittata is a species within the Lispe genus,14\n5007,LISPE,LISPE BIVITTATA SUBBIVITTATA,Lispe bivittata subbivittata is a subspecies within the Lispe genus,14\n5008,LISPE,LISPE ORIENTALIS,Lispe orientalis is a species within the Lispe genus,14\n5004,LISPE,LISPE QUADERNS,Lispe quaerens is a species within the Lispe genus,13\n11859,LISPE,LATRELLLE,Latrellle described the genus Lispe,13\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
