The country served as the **type locality** for *Phaonia hybrida*, a fly species first described in the region, highlighting its significance in entomological taxonomy. Additionally, Czechoslovakia is reported as a location where *Musca larvipara*, a species of muscid fly, has been observed, contributing to its ecological and zoogeographical records. The region is also linked to the distribution of *Helina obscuratoides*, a fly species within the family Muscidae, and *Blaesoxipha lautaretensis*, a member of the family Tachinidae, both of which are noted to occur in its territory. Furthermore, the genus *Sinonipponia*, a group of flies in the family Tachinidae, is documented as being distributed in Czechoslovakia, underscoring the country's role in the biodiversity of parasitic flies. These associations reflect Czechoslovakia's historical importance as a hub for entomological research and its contribution to the understanding of dipteran species. The country’s varied ecosystems, including its temperate forests, alpine regions, and agricultural landscapes, likely supported the habitats of these species. Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, its successor states (the Czech Republic and Slovakia) continue to inherit these ecological legacies, though modern studies may now focus on the split regions separately. The data collectively emphasize Czechoslovakia’s role in the scientific description and geographic distribution of these specific fly species, with its historical records remaining relevant for taxonomic and biogeographical analyses.
