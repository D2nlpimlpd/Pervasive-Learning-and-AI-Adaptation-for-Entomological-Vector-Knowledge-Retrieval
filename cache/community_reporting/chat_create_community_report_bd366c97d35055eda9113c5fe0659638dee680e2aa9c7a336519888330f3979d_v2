It is primarily associated with multiple specimen collections, including a paratype, which is a type of reference specimen used in taxonomic studies. The city is specifically linked to the species *Phaonia brunneipalpis*, a fly species documented in the region, and *Limnophora orbitalis*, another species known to be distributed there. Additionally, XINGCHENG is connected to *Caricea mikii*, a plant species native to the area, further highlighting its ecological importance. As a location within Liaoning, XINGCHENG serves as a key site for scientific research, particularly in entomology and botany, due to its association with these diverse taxa. The city’s role in specimen collection underscores its contribution to understanding regional biodiversity and species distribution patterns. While some descriptions refer to it as an \"\"area\"\" and others as a \"\"city,\"\" the consensus is that XINGCHENG is a specific urban center in Liaoning Province, China, with documented biological significance. Its repeated mention in relation to various species and collections emphasizes its value as a focal point for taxonomic and ecological studies in the region.\",5\n1617,JINXI,,3\n3820,BELLARDIA NARTSHUKAE,\"A species of fly described by Grunin in 1970, distributed in China, the Soviet Union, and Japan, with ecological traits like population peaks in June and attraction to sugar\",11\n2592,MYDAEA (S.STR.)

Between 1973 and 1980, he collected specimens for multiple *Mydaea* species in China, with a notable focus on Benxi, Liaoning, where he gathered the holotype of *Mydaea breviscutellata* on July 24, 1980. His work in 1978 also documented the distribution of *Chirosia similata* in the same region, specifically in Benxi Nandian.  \n\nIn 1973, Xue Wanqi authored a report on fly species in the *Entomological Journal* and a more detailed study on *Chionomyia vetula* in *Acta Entomologica Sinica*. The latter study, conducted while affiliated with Shenyang Normal University, provided critical insights into the third-instar larval morphology and breeding habits of *Chionomyia vetula*, advancing understanding of its life cycle. Additionally, he collected specimens of *Limnophora purgata* in Benxi, Liaoning, further demonstrating his role in documenting regional dipteran biodiversity.  \n\nXue Wanqi’s research spans both fieldwork and academic publication, with a particular emphasis on the taxonomy, ecology, and distribution of flies in northeastern China. His affiliation with Shenyang Normal University during the 1970s and 1980s underscores his institutional role in entomological studies, and his contributions to a book (specific title unspecified) highlight his collaborative efforts in compiling scientific knowledge. By combining specimen collection, detailed morphological analysis, and distributional records, Xue Wanqi’s work has provided foundational data for the classification and ecological understanding of these species. His activities in Liaoning, especially in Benxi, reflect a sustained focus on the region’s insect fauna, contributing to broader entomological research in China.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",13\n2602,\"642短盾圆蝇MYDAEA (S.STR.)

HSUE has contributed to the journal by describing two species within the genus *Sinohylemya*: *Sinohylemya craspedodonta* and *Sinohylemya ctenocnema*. These descriptions were published in the journal, which is also known by its Chinese name, 动物分类学报, and serves as a platform for taxonomic research in zoology. The journal's dual naming reflects its bilingual context, catering to both Chinese and international audiences. HSUE's work highlights the journal's role in documenting biodiversity, particularly in the field of animal taxonomy. The two species described by HSUE, *S. craspedodonta* and *S. ctenocnema*, are part of the broader scientific contributions featured in this academic resource. \n\nThe **Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy** (动物分类学报) is a specialized periodical that focuses on systematic biology, emphasizing the classification, identification, and nomenclature of animal taxa. It provides a venue for researchers to publish new species discoveries, taxonomic revisions, and related studies. HSUE's publications in this journal demonstrate its significance in advancing taxonomic knowledge, particularly for species within the genus *Sinohylemya*. The journal's Chinese title, 动物分类学报, directly translates to \"\"Animal Taxonomy Journal,\"\" aligning with its English counterpart in both purpose and content. \n\nBy resolving the apparent redundancy in the descriptions (which refer to the same journal under different names), the summary clarifies that HSUE's contributions to *Sinohylemya craspedodonta* and *Sinohylemya ctenocnema* were published in the **Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy** (动物分类学报). This ensures a coherent narrative that unifies the information while maintaining the context of the entities involved. The journal's role as a bilingual academic resource is emphasized, as is HSUE's specific research output within it. \n\nIn total, the summary integrates all provided data, confirming that HSUE described two species in the **Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy** (动物分类学报) and contextualizing the journal's purpose and naming conventions. It avoids contradictions by recognizing the equivalence of the journal's Chinese and English titles and consolidates the species mentioned across the descriptions. The result is a concise, third-person overview that adheres to the 500-word limit and provides full context for both entities.\",77\n7404,ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,POLLONOMYIA FALCILOBA,The species was described in this 1979 journal,70\n5813,LUEGU YANGYING,HENNIG,Hennig described the species LUEGU YANGYING,67\n4866,LIMNOPHORA PURGATA,XUE,Xue described the new species *Limnophora purgata*,64\n6345,JOURNAL OF THE LIAONING ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY,XUE,Xue is an author in the Liaoning journal for Phaonia species,60\n4167,HAEMATOBOSCA PERTURBANS,HUNJIANG,\"The species Haematobosca perturbans is distributed in Hunjiang, Jilin\",45\n2581,BENXI,SOCIELLA FANNIA,Sociella Fannia is found in Benxi City,44\n12035,BENXI,BENXI HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,The station is located in the city of Benxi,39\n5146,CARICEA ODONTA,HSUE,Hsue described Caricea odonta in 1981,35\n6668,LUCILIA (S.

The species was first described in 1976 by the scientific author **Hsue**, who is credited with its formal taxonomic classification. Hsue's work established *Hydrotaea silva* as a distinct entity within the broader context of hydrotaeid fly research, contributing to the understanding of biodiversity in this taxonomic group. The name \"\"silva\"\" likely reflects a characteristic or inspiration related to the species' habitat or morphology, though specific details about its ecological or physical traits are not provided in the descriptions. Hsue's role as the describer of *Hydrotaea silva* underscores their contribution to entomological science, particularly in the study of flies. Both the entity *Hydrotaea silva* and the author Hsue are directly linked through this taxonomic act, with the year 1976 marking the formal recognition of the species.
