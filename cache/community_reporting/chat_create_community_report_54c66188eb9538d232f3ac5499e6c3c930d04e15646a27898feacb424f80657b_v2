Active primarily in the 1980s, YE described multiple species across different genera, including *Parasarcophaga nanpingensis* (1980), *Heteronychia macromembrana* (1980), and the genus *Pterosarcophaga* (1981). In 1981, they also authored the description of *1338舟曲细麻蝇* (Zhouqu fine tachinid fly), a species with a Chinese name. Their work in 1982 included *Robineauella nigribasicosta*, and in 1983, they described *Lucilia (Phaenicia) angustifrontata*.  \n\nYE collaborated on several projects, co-authoring the description of *范氏细麻蝇* (Fan’s fine tachinid fly) in 1985 and the new species *Sarcosolomonia hongheensis*. In 1985, they independently described *Iranihindia spinosa*. Additionally, they were cited for providing domestic distribution data of a fly species in China, underscoring their role in documenting regional biodiversity. Notably, YE is also referenced for a 1962 publication, though the specific content of this work is not detailed in the provided data.  \n\nAmong their most notable works are the 1980 descriptions of two *Pierretia* species: *1350 Globular Vesicle Pierretia Fly* and *1352 Lingulate Pierretia Fly*. These contributions, along with the genus *Pterosarcophaga*, highlight their expertise in tachinid flies. YE further described *GLOBOVESICA SARCOPHAGA* in 1980, though the exact species name appears inconsistent with other entries (likely a typographical variation of the 1350 Globular Vesicle Pierretia Fly). They also described *贺兰山欧麻蝇* (Helanshan European tachinid fly), a species associated with the Helan Mountains in China.  \n\nYE’s research spans both taxonomic descriptions and ecological documentation, with a focus on Chinese fly species. Their work in the 1980s established foundational knowledge for understanding the diversity and distribution of tachinid and sarcophagid flies in the region. Collaborations, such as the co-description of *Sarcosolomonia hongheensis*, further demonstrate their engagement with peers in advancing entomological science. Despite some inconsistencies in species naming (e.g., \"\"1338舟曲细麻蝇\"\" and \"\"1350 Globular Vesicle Pierretia Fly\"\" likely refer to the same species), the cumulative evidence positions YE as a key figure in the study of dipteran taxonomy, particularly for species native to China.
