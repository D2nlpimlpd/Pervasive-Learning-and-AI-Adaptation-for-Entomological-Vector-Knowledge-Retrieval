Distributed in Heilongjiang (Gulian) in China and Europe (Alps, type locality), North America\",5\n1033,STROBL,\"\n\n**STROBL** is a scholar and taxonomist associated with the description of multiple insect species and genera, primarily within the Diptera order. He is credited as the author of *Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes*, a species cited in the *Insect Research Journal*. Additionally, STROBL described the genus *Platycoenosia* in 1894, contributing to the classification of flies within this group. In 1898, he formally described the species *Delia longicauda*, which is part of the Delia genus. His work also includes the 1909 description of *Meigenia rubromaculata*, where he played a role in refining the taxonomy of the *Meigenia* genus. Furthermore, STROBL is noted as the scholar who described *Ph. jugorum* (likely *Phaonia jugorum* or a similar species, though the full binomial is not provided in the data).  \n\nHowever, there is a historical inaccuracy in the attribution of *Lispocephala miki* (1893), where STROBL’s name was incorrectly used as the author. This suggests a possible confusion or miscitation in taxonomic records for that species. Despite this error, his contributions to entomology remain significant, spanning the late 19th and early 20th centuries. STROBL’s work appears to focus on Diptera, particularly flies, with a notable emphasis on species and genus-level classifications. His descriptions of *Delia longicauda* and *Platycoenosia* highlight his role in organizing and naming these taxa, while his 1909 study of *Meigenia rubromaculata* underscores his engagement with the *Meigenia* genus. The mention of *Ph. jugorum* further indicates his involvement in documenting diverse fly species, though the exact context of this work is less detailed.  \n\nThe data reveals STROBL’s active participation in taxonomic research during the 1890s and 1900s, with a focus on morphological and systematic studies of flies. His work in 1894 on *Platycoenosia* and 1898 on *Delia longicauda* aligns with the broader scientific efforts of the era to catalog and classify insect biodiversity. The 1909 description of *Meigenia rubromaculata* reflects his continued contributions to the field. While the incorrect citation of *Lispocephala miki* (1893) raises questions about the accuracy of some records, the majority of his documented work is consistent and well-supported. STROBL’s legacy includes foundational taxonomic descriptions that remain referenced in entomological literature, such as the *Insect Research Journal*.  \n\nIn summary, STROBL is recognized as a key figure in the classification of Diptera, with notable works on *Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes*, *Delia longicauda*, *Meigenia rubromaculata*, and the genus *Platycoenosia*. His contributions to the *Meigenia* genus and the description of *Ph. jugorum* further solidify his role in advancing the understanding of fly taxonomy. The misattribution of *Lispocephala miki* (1893) serves as a cautionary note about the importance of verifying historical taxonomic records.
