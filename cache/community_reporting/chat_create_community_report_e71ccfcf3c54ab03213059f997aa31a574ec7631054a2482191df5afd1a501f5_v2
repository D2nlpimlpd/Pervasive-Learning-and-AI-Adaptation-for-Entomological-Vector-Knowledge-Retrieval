It is noted as a distribution site for *Helina calceataeformis*, a fly species within the family Sarcophagidae, and *Sarcophaga haematodes*, another member of the same family, which is also referenced in the context of a taxonomic key for the tribe Sarcophagini. Additionally, *Musca larvipara*, a species of fly in the family Muscidae, has been reported in Tunisia, underscoring the country’s role in the geographic range of diverse dipteran taxa. \n\nThe data further specifies that Tunisia serves as the type locality for *Leucophora amicula*, a species whose original description is tied to this region, emphasizing its importance in entomological research. As a foreign country mentioned in the text, Tunisia is explicitly linked to the Sarcophagini tribe’s taxonomic framework, which is used to classify and identify species within this group. This connection suggests that the country’s ecosystems contribute to the broader understanding of Sarcophaginae (flesh flies) and their relatives. \n\nCollectively, these references illustrate Tunisia’s biodiversity as a habitat for multiple fly species, including both Sarcophagidae and Muscidae families, and its relevance in taxonomic studies. The inclusion of the country in a Sarcophagini key highlights its role in regional entomological classification efforts, while the designation of *Leucophora amicula* as having Tunisia as its type locality underscores the country’s historical and scientific value in species discovery. The presence of *Musca larvipara* and the distribution of *Helina calceataeformis* and *Sarcophaga haematodes* further reflect Tunisia’s ecological diversity, supporting a range of insect life that may be studied for insights into taxonomy, biogeography, and ecosystem dynamics. \n\nThe descriptions are consistent in framing Tunisia as a key location for these species, with no contradictions to resolve. The country’s mention in both distributional and taxonomic contexts reinforces its importance in entomological literature, particularly for dipteran groups.
