The genus is taxonomically distinguished by several key anatomical traits, including a nearly bare arista (a bristle-like structure on the head), short bristles located at the base of the arista, and other morphological characteristics specific to its classification. These features help differentiate *Synthesiomyia* from closely related genera within the subfamily. The genus was first formally described in 1893 by the entomologists Brauer and Bergenstamm, who established its taxonomic framework based on observed morphological attributes.  \n\n*Synthesiomyia* is notable for including the species *Synthesiomyia nudiseta*, which is a well-documented member of the genus. This species, like others in the genus, exhibits the defining traits of *Synthesiomyia*, such as the nearly bare arista and short bristles at its base. The genus is part of the broader ecological and taxonomic study of flies, particularly those with specialized adaptations in their anatomy. While the descriptions provided focus on morphological classification, further research into the genus may explore its ecological roles, geographic distribution, or interactions with other organisms.  \n\nThe information presented is consistent across the descriptions, with no contradictions to resolve. Together, they establish *Synthesiomyia* as a distinct taxonomic group characterized by unique anatomical features and its inclusion of the species *S. nudiseta*. The work of Brauer and Bergenstamm remains foundational to its classification, underscoring the importance of historical taxonomic contributions in modern biological studies.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided data points, ensuring clarity and coherence while adhering to the third-person perspective and contextualizing the entity names.
