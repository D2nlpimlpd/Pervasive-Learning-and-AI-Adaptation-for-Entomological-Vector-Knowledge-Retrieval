In 1939, ÔUCHI described the subspecies *Graphomya maculata tienmushanensis*, a taxonomic designation within the *Graphomya* genus. This work marked an early contribution to the study of dipteran insects, focusing on geographic or morphological distinctions within the species *Graphomya maculata*.  \n\nIn 1942, ÔUCHI expanded their taxonomic work by authoring the species description for *Orthellia cornicina*, a member of the *Orthellia* genus. The same year, they also described *Orthellia sinensis*, further establishing their role in documenting biodiversity within this group. These two species, *Orthellia cornicina* and *Orthellia sinensis*, are distinct but share the same genus, indicating ÔUCHI’s focus on *Orthellia* during this period. The 1942 publications likely reflect systematic studies of Orthellia species, possibly in East Asia, given the specific epithet \"\"sinensis\"\" (referring to China) in one of the names.  \n\nWhile the descriptions provided do not clarify the exact geographic or ecological contexts of these species, the timeline and genera suggest ÔUCHI’s work spanned multiple taxonomic groups and time periods. Their 1939 subspecies description and 1942 species-level contributions highlight a progression in their research, potentially aligning with broader entomological efforts of the era. The lack of conflicting information in the data allows for a unified summary of ÔUCHI’s role as a taxonomic authority for these three distinct classifications.  \n\nOverall, ÔUCHI’s work remains significant in entomology, particularly for their early 20th-century documentation of *Graphomya* and *Orthellia* taxa. Their descriptions of *Graphomya maculata tienmushanensis* (1939), *Orthellia cornicina* (1942), and *Orthellia sinensis* (1942) underscore their expertise in species delineation and subspecies differentiation, contributing to the foundational understanding of these insect groups. The consistency in the data supports the conclusion that all three works are attributable to the same individual, ÔUCHI, without contradictions.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",3\n2383,ORTHELLIA CORNICINA,,1\n2699,ENT.
