It hosts a diverse array of taxa, including *Atherigona* species such as *A. reversura*, *A. bidens*, *A. yiwulushan*, and *A. biseta*, as well as *Metopia argyrocephala* and *Metopia sauteri* (type locality: Dazukou). The genus *Myospila* is particularly notable, with multiple species like *M. laevis*, *M. meditabunda brunettiana*, and *M. meditabunda meditabunda* recorded there. Additionally, *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Limnophora fallax fallax*, *Limnophora albitarsis*, and *Limnophora tigrina tigrina* (type locality) are documented in the region.  \n\nTaiwan is also home to *Dichaetomyia* species, including *D. quadrata* and several unnamed members found in cities like Kaohsiung, Taichung, Tainan, Hengchun, and Chiayi. The genus *Hylemya* and its relative *Sinohylemya* are present, alongside *Bengalia* species such as *B. (Ochromyia) escheri* and *B. taiwanensis*. Notable species include *Chrysomyia pinguis*, *C. megacephala*, and *C. bezziana*, distributed in areas like Xinzhu, Fenglin, and Kenting. *Phaonia villana* and *P. fuscata* are also reported, as are *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis* and *Anthomyia illocata*.  \n\nThe region supports *Hydrotaea jacobsoni* and *H. affinis*, with the latter having Tainan as its type locality. *Hemipyrellia liguriens* is found in Taiping Mountain, while *Graphomya rufitibia* (type locality: Chiayi) and *Rhyncomya setipyga* are recorded. *Sarcorohdendorfia antilope* and *S. mimobasalis* are distributed domestically, as are *Stomoxys sitiens* and *S. uruma*. The genus *Adia* and species like *Caricea boops*, *Drino curvipalpis*, *Exorista jugoslavica*, *Austrophorocera*, *Goniophyto formosensis*, and *Caiusa testacea* are also part of Taiwan’s fly fauna.  \n\nFurther, *Lasiopelta longicornis*, *Hebecnema fumosa*, *Strongyloneura prasina*, and *Scathophaga mellipes* are documented, along with *Winthemia* and *Isomyia* species such as *I. isomyia*, *I. electa*, and *I. viridaurea*. The region includes type localities for *Tainanina pilisquama* and *T. sarcophagoides*, as well as *Paradichosia crinitarsis* and *P. nigricans*. Fly larvae have been observed in animal corpses, and species like *Musca convexifrons*, *M. crassirostris*, *M. pilifacies*, and *M. conducens* are distributed in locations such as Leye and Nanyu Forestry Experimental Station.  \n\nTaiwan’s biodiversity also encompasses *Neomyia* species (e.g., in Kaohsiung), *Sarcosolomonia*, *Haematobia*, and *Sisyropa prominens*. The province is a key area for *Sarcorohdendorfia antilope* and *S. mimobasalis*, as well as *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis* and *Anthomyia plumiseta*.
