It is found in Fujian, China.>\",4\n3881,PACIFIC INSECTS,\"\n\n**PACIFIC INSECTS** is a scientific journal dedicated to the study and documentation of insect species, particularly those found in the Pacific region. It has served as a key publication platform for entomologists to describe and reference newly discovered or taxonomically significant species since at least the 1970s. The journal has been cited in multiple instances for its role in publishing detailed accounts of various insect taxa, including species from the genera *Polleniopsis*, *Paradichosia*, *Melinda*, and *Sarcosolomonia*.  \n\nAmong the species documented in *Pacific Insects* are *Polleniopsis yunnanensis* and *Polleniopsis fukienensis*, which were published in the journal as part of its contributions to the taxonomy of the *Polleniopsis* genus. Additionally, *Paradichosia vanemdeni* was first described in the journal in 1970, marking an early example of its role in formalizing new species. The same year, *Melinda maai* (Kurahashi, 1970) was also first described in *Pacific Insects*, with the authorship and year of description attributed to Kurahashi. This species, like *Paradichosia vanemdeni*, highlights the journal’s historical significance in the 1970s for advancing knowledge of insect biodiversity.  \n\nFurther, *Sarcosolomonia harinasutai* was referenced in *Pacific Insects* in 1977, indicating the journal’s continued activity in documenting new or notable insect species over time. The inclusion of these species across different years and genera suggests that *Pacific Insects* has a broad scope, covering diverse insect groups and geographic regions within the Pacific. Its role as a repository for taxonomic work is reinforced by the fact that multiple species have been formally described or cited in its pages, contributing to the scientific community’s understanding of entomological diversity.  \n\nThe journal’s name and content imply a regional focus on Pacific-area insects, though the specific examples provided span different taxonomic contexts and publication dates. The descriptions are consistent in identifying *Pacific Insects* as a publication venue for entomological research, with no direct contradictions in the data. By compiling these references, it is evident that the journal has been instrumental in the formal documentation of several insect species, serving as a critical resource for researchers and taxonomists in the field. Its historical contributions, particularly in the 1970s, underscore its importance in the study of insect classification and ecology.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",3\n5018,SARCOSOLOMONIA HARINASUTAI,,5\n5010,SOOKSRI,Sooksri is a scientist who co-described the species Sarcosolomonia harinasutai in 1977,1\n5011,DAMELONG,\"Damelong is a location in Yunnan, China, associated with Sarcosolomonia harinasutai\",1\n2140,SHAOWU,\"\n\n**SHAOWU** is a city located in Fujian Province, China, and is recognized as a significant geographical and taxonomic reference point. It is associated with the species *Atherigona reversura*, a fly belonging to the family Muscidae, which is linked to this location in entomological studies. Additionally, SHAOWU is part of the distribution range for *Musca crassirostris*, another species within the same family, highlighting its ecological relevance in the region. Most notably, SHAOWU serves as the **type locality** for *Melinda maai* Kurahashi, 1970, a species described by the entomologist Kurahashi in 1970, underscoring its importance in the formal classification and scientific documentation of this particular organism. These associations collectively emphasize SHAOWU’s role in biodiversity research and its contribution to the understanding of fly species in Fujian, China. The city’s inclusion in the distribution of *Musca crassirostris* and its connection to *Atherigona reversura* further illustrate its value as a focal area for studying insect populations and their habitats. As the type locality for *Melinda maai*, SHAOWU is the specific site where the original specimens of this species were collected and described, making it a critical location for taxonomic reference. The descriptions provided are consistent in identifying SHAOWU as a city in Fujian, China, with no contradictions to resolve.
