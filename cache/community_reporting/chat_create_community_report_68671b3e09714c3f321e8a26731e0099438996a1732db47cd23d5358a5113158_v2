His work in 1978 also documented the distribution of *Chirosia similata* in the same region, specifically in Benxi Nandian.  \n\nIn 1973, Xue Wanqi authored a report on fly species in the *Entomological Journal* and a more detailed study on *Chionomyia vetula* in *Acta Entomologica Sinica*. The latter study, conducted while affiliated with Shenyang Normal University, provided critical insights into the third-instar larval morphology and breeding habits of *Chionomyia vetula*, advancing understanding of its life cycle. Additionally, he collected specimens of *Limnophora purgata* in Benxi, Liaoning, further demonstrating his role in documenting regional dipteran biodiversity.  \n\nXue Wanqi’s research spans both fieldwork and academic publication, with a particular emphasis on the taxonomy, ecology, and distribution of flies in northeastern China. His affiliation with Shenyang Normal University during the 1970s and 1980s underscores his institutional role in entomological studies, and his contributions to a book (specific title unspecified) highlight his collaborative efforts in compiling scientific knowledge. By combining specimen collection, detailed morphological analysis, and distributional records, Xue Wanqi’s work has provided foundational data for the classification and ecological understanding of these species.

HSUE has contributed to the journal by describing two species within the genus *Sinohylemya*: *Sinohylemya craspedodonta* and *Sinohylemya ctenocnema*. These descriptions were published in the journal, which is also known by its Chinese name, 动物分类学报, and serves as a platform for taxonomic research in zoology. The journal's dual naming reflects its bilingual context, catering to both Chinese and international audiences. HSUE's work highlights the journal's role in documenting biodiversity, particularly in the field of animal taxonomy. The two species described by HSUE, *S. craspedodonta* and *S. ctenocnema*, are part of the broader scientific contributions featured in this academic resource. \n\nThe **Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy** (动物分类学报) is a specialized periodical that focuses on systematic biology, emphasizing the classification, identification, and nomenclature of animal taxa. It provides a venue for researchers to publish new species discoveries, taxonomic revisions, and related studies. HSUE's publications in this journal demonstrate its significance in advancing taxonomic knowledge, particularly for species within the genus *Sinohylemya*. The journal's Chinese title, 动物分类学报, directly translates to \"\"Animal Taxonomy Journal,\"\" aligning with its English counterpart in both purpose and content. \n\nBy resolving the apparent redundancy in the descriptions (which refer to the same journal under different names), the summary clarifies that HSUE's contributions to *Sinohylemya craspedodonta* and *Sinohylemya ctenocnema* were published in the **Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy** (动物分类学报). This ensures a coherent narrative that unifies the information while maintaining the context of the entities involved.
