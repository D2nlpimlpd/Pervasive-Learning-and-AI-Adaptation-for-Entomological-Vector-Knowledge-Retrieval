This region, characterized by its warm and humid climate, supports the ecological habitats of these horse botflies, which are parasitic insects primarily associated with equine hosts. The descriptions provided highlight that *Gasterophilus* species, including those referred to as 胃蝇属 and 象胃蝇属 in Chinese taxonomic terminology, are specifically found in this tropical African area. While the English and Chinese terms for the genus appear distinct, they correspond to the same biological classification, emphasizing the region’s role in the geographic range of these organisms. The Tropical Africa region’s unique environmental conditions likely contribute to the survival and proliferation of these species, which are adapted to the local ecosystems. This information consolidates the entity’s significance as a biogeographic hotspot for *Gasterophilus* and underscores the importance of regional biodiversity studies in understanding their distribution patterns. The summary integrates both linguistic and scientific perspectives to provide a cohesive overview of the entity’s ecological relevance.\",2\n4688,澳洲区,\"\n\nThe **Australian Region** (澳洲区) is a biogeographic region that encompasses Australia and its surrounding territories, serving as a key distribution area for the **Gasterophilus** genus (胃蝇属), a group of horse botflies. This region is characterized by its unique ecological and geographical features, which support the presence and diversity of certain *Gasterophilus* species. Specifically, the Australian Region is highlighted as one of the primary zones where these insects are found, with their distribution tied to the region’s specific environmental conditions. The term \"\"澳洲区\"\" is used to denote this area in both scientific and regional contexts, emphasizing its role in the biogeography of the genus. While the descriptions provided are largely consistent, the first and third clarify that the region is associated with *Gasterophilus* species, whereas the second is a more general statement. Resolving this, the Australian Region is definitively a biogeographic zone where the Gasterophilus genus is distributed, with particular relevance to Australia and adjacent areas. Its significance lies in the ecological niche it provides for these species, which are adapted to the region’s flora, fauna, and climate.
