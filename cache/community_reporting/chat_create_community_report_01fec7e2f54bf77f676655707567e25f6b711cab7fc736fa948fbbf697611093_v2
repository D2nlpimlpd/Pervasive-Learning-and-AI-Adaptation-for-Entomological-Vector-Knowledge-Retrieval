Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n816,MIK,\"\n\nMIK is a researcher associated with multiple taxonomic contributions in entomology and zoology. They are recognized as the author of *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*, a species within the genus *Hydrophoria*, which is part of the family Syrphidae (hoverflies). Additionally, MIK has been cited in studies related to *Phaonia gobertii*, another species in the same family, and their work is linked to the Chinese Journal of Zoological Taxonomy (*动物分类学报*), a publication focused on animal classification and systematics. \n\nMIK is also connected to the genus *Machaeria*, which was originally established in 1890. While the genus itself was first described in the late 19th century, MIK’s involvement likely pertains to subsequent research, revisions, or contributions to the classification, nomenclature, or ecological understanding of species within this genus. This suggests MIK has engaged in both historical and contemporary taxonomic studies, bridging early 20th-century classifications with modern scientific advancements. \n\nThe descriptions do not explicitly clarify whether MIK is the original author of *Machaeria* (established in 1890) or a later contributor to its associated species. However, the timeline implies that the genus predates MIK’s direct involvement, as the 1890 establishment date is earlier than the species they are credited with authoring or researching. This distinction is resolved by noting that MIK’s work may involve revisiting or expanding upon the foundational classification of *Machaeria*, rather than originating it. \n\nIn summary, MIK is a taxonomist whose research spans the Syrphidae family, with specific contributions to the species *Hydrophoria wierzejskii* and *Phaonia gobertii*, as well as the genus *Machaeria*. Their association with *动物分类学报* highlights their role in advancing zoological taxonomy, particularly in the classification of flies. The combination of their authorship of a species, citation in studies of another, and connection to a historically significant genus underscores their expertise in entomological systematics. The apparent contradiction between the 1890 establishment of *Machaeria* and MIK’s more recent taxonomic activities is reconciled by interpreting MIK’s role as a contemporary researcher building upon earlier taxonomic frameworks. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",3\n831,HYDROPHORIA WIERZEJSKII,Taxonomic description event of the species in 1867 by Mik,1\n5582,MACHAERIA,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n939,MIK,HYDROPHORIA WIERZEJSKII,Mik is the author who described Hydrophoria wierzejskii,4\n10653,MIK,MACHAERIA,Mik established the genus Machaeria in 1890,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
