It has served as a platform for documenting and describing various species, including *Calythea limnophorina* and *Polietes hirticrura*. The journal’s role in entomological research is highlighted by its historical contributions, such as the formal description of *Polietes hirticrura* in 1887, which underscores its significance in the taxonomy and classification of insect species. While the specific context of *Calythea limnophorina*’s documentation in the journal is not detailed, the inclusion of this species alongside *Polietes hirticrura* suggests that ENT.MON.MAG. has been a repository for diverse entomological findings. The journal’s monthly publication format likely facilitated timely dissemination of discoveries, supporting ongoing scientific discourse in the field. ENT.MON.MAG. appears to have been a key resource for entomologists, providing a record of both well-known and newly identified species, though its scope and other documented taxa remain unspecified in the provided data. The combination of these references establishes ENT.MON.MAG. as a historically relevant periodical in entomology, with a documented role in species identification and academic communication.\",3\n1954,POLIETES HIRTICRURA,\"A species of fly described by Meade in 1887.

According to the provided data, Meade is credited as the author of *Hydrotaea parva*, though no specific year is mentioned for this contribution. Additionally, Meade described the species *Polietes hirticrura* in 1887, a detail confirmed in two separate entries. In 1876, he is noted as the author of *Parasarcophaga similis*, and in 1887, he also described *Hydrotaea similis*. These records indicate that Meade worked on both the *Hydrotaea* and *Polietes* genera, as well as the *Parasarcophaga* genus, with his taxonomic contributions spanning at least two decades (1876–1887). The species *Polietes hirticrura* and *Hydrotaea similis* are both linked to 1887, suggesting a possible focus on related taxa during that year. While the descriptions of *Hydrotaea parva* and *Hydrotaea similis* refer to different species within the same genus, they are distinct and do not conflict. The data does not clarify whether Meade is a single individual or a collective name, but all entries consistently attribute these species to the entity \"\"MEADE\"\" without contradiction. His work appears to center on dipteran insects, given the genera involved, and his contributions to taxonomy are documented in scientific literature with specific dates for three of the four species.
