It is primarily found in the Palaearctic, Oriental, Afrotropical, and Australian regions, indicating its presence across diverse ecosystems spanning these biogeographic zones. Taxonomically, CARICEA is notable for its distinct bristle patterns, particularly the strong basal scutellum bristles, which are a defining feature of the genus. Additionally, the lower arista (a sensory appendage on the head) is longer than the upper arista, further contributing to its identification. In terms of sexual dimorphism, male CARICEA flies are characterized by the absence of long setae (hairs) on the fifth tergite, a trait that differentiates them from other related genera. These morphological traits—strong scutellum bristles, asymmetrical arista length, and the lack of long setae in males—collectively provide a framework for distinguishing CARICEA from similar fly genera. The genus’s wing features, though not explicitly detailed in the descriptions, are also highlighted as distinctive, suggesting adaptations or structural traits relevant to its ecological niche. Overall, CARICEA represents a taxonomically coherent group within the fly family, with a combination of physical markers and distribution patterns that support its classification and study in entomological research.\",4\n2851,\"MITT,ZOOL,MUS,BERLIN\",A journal (Mittellungen des Zoologischen Museums in Berlin) where Caricea genus was described,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5027,CARICEA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Caricea,116\n5097,CARICEA,\"MITT,ZOOL,MUS,BERLIN\",The Caricea genus was described in the journal Mittellungen des Zoologischen Museums in Berlin,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
