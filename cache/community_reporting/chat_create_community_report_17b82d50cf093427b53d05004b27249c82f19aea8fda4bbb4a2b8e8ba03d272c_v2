This taxonomic group is a fundamental classification in entomology, with species exhibiting a wide range of ecological roles, including pollination, decomposition, and parasitism. The order is further divided into suborders, with one notable classification system proposed by Steyskal, who grouped Diptera into **Tipulata** and **Psychodata**. However, this classification is less commonly referenced in modern taxonomy, where Diptera is typically split into suborders such as **Nematocera** (e.g., mosquitoes, crane flies) and **Brachycera** (e.g., houseflies, fruit flies), based on morphological and developmental traits.  \n\nA specific example of a species within Diptera is **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) idmais**, which has been documented in the journal *Encycl.Ent.* This species highlights the diversity of the order, as it belongs to the family Sarcophagidae (flesh flies), a subgroup of Brachycera. The inclusion of such species underscores the broad phylogenetic and ecological scope of Diptera, which includes both free-living and parasitic forms.  \n\nWhile Steyskal’s division into Tipulata and Psychodata reflects historical taxonomic approaches, contemporary classifications often prioritize evolutionary relationships and genetic data. Despite these variations in suborder categorization, all descriptions agree that Diptera is a monophyletic group, meaning its members share a common ancestor. The order is distinguished by unique features such as a single pair of wings, a well-developed halter, and a wide range of larval habitats, from aquatic environments to terrestrial detritus.  \n\nIn summary, **Diptera** represents a critical and diverse insect order, with species like *Parasarcophaga idmais* illustrating its ecological and taxonomic complexity. The classification into suborders remains a topic of debate, with Steyskal’s Tipulata and Psychodata serving as one framework among others, while the broader significance of Diptera in ecosystems and human contexts (e.g., disease transmission, forensic entomology) remains undisputed.\",8\n313,STEYSKAL,\"Steyskal is an entomologist who proposed a classification system for Diptera in 1974, building upon Hennig's work\",1\n314,TIPULATA,Tipulata is a suborder of Diptera containing only the infraorder Tipulomorpha,1\n167,CYCLORRHAPHA,\"\n\nCyclorrhapha, also known as 环裂亚目 in Chinese, is a suborder of Diptera (the true flies) characterized by distinct morphological features such as the presence of a lunule—a crescent-shaped sclerite on the head—and specific arrangements of bristles (setae) on the body. This group is notable for its well-developed facial structures, which are a key diagnostic trait. As a major taxonomic division within the fly order, Cyclorrhapha encompasses a wide diversity of species, including both the Calyptratae and Acalyptratae infraorders. Calyptratae, often referred to as \"\"higher flies,\"\" are distinguished by the presence of a fleshy, flap-like structure called a calypter covering the halteres, while Acalyptratae lack this feature and include many smaller, more primitive fly species. These infraorders represent significant evolutionary branches within the suborder, reflecting adaptations in feeding, reproduction, and ecological roles. Cyclorrhapha is a well-known and ecologically important group in entomology, with members inhabiting nearly all terrestrial environments and playing roles as decomposers, pollinators, and pests. The suborder’s defining traits, such as the lunule and bristle patterns, are critical for taxonomic identification and highlight its evolutionary distinctiveness among dipterans.\",3\n295,POPEHNOP,PopeHnorp is a researcher who proposed a classification system for Diptera in 1961,1\n309,POPEHNOP 1961,PopeHnorp's 1961 classification system dividing Diptera into Archidiptera and Eudiptera,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n233,DIPTERA,MUSCOMORPHA,Muscomorpha is a suborder within the order Diptera,17\n244,STEYSKAL,DIPTERA,Steyskal proposed a classification system for the order Diptera in 1974,9\n246,DIPTERA,TIPULATA,Tipulata is a suborder within the order Diptera,9\n142,SCHIZOPHORA,CYCLORRHAPHA,Schizophora is a taxonomic section that includes the suborder Cyclorrhapha as a subset,6\n229,POPEHNOP,POPEHNOP 1961,PopeHnorp developed the 1961 Diptera classification system,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
