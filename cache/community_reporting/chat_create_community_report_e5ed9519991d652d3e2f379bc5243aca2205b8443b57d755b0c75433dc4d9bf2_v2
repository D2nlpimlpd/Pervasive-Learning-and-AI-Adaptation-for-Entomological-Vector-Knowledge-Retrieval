It serves as a domestic distribution area for multiple species of flies and insects, including *Aplomyia*, three near-vein flower fly species (曲叶近脉花蝇, 毛足近脉花蝇, 瘦叶近脉花蝇), and the long-leaf green fly (*长叶绿蝇*). Specific regions within Qinghai, such as Yushu Prefecture, Haixi Prefecture, and Huangnan Prefecture, are highlighted as habitats for these species. The province is also associated with the distribution of *Protocalliphora azurea* and *Protocalliphora chrysorrhoea*, as well as *Phormiata* species like *Ph. decussata* (Stein) and *Ph. rufitarsis* (Stein). Additionally, Qinghai hosts *Sarcophila rasnitzyni*, a species documented in the region.  \n\nHistorically, Qinghai has been noted for the presence of *Oestrus ovis*, a botfly species, as recorded by Cui Yingmin in 1965. The province is a key location for *Delia floricola* (flower maggot) and two *Chironomidae* midge species, 尖扁泉种蝇 and 扁狭泉种蝇. It is also home to *Aphananeura* and *Schoenomyza* species, as well as *Dasyphora* species, which are part of its broader insect biodiversity.  \n\nQinghai plays a significant role in the distribution of hypodermatid flies, including *Hypoderma sinense* and *Hypoderma qinghaiense*, the latter named after the province. The region is further linked to the occurrence of 斑腿透翅寄蝇 (a tachinid fly) and 牛皮蝇 (a botfly species). Among the more specialized species, Qinghai is the type locality for the *Alophrum* species 青稞穗蝇, with its mode locality in Xining and Zhuhu. The province also supports the *Alypius* species 苦荬泉种蝇 and 青泽菊泉蝇, as well as the *Calliphoridae* genus 斑麻蝇属 (Chrysomya) and the *Sepsidae* group 细鬃棘蝇群.  \n\nGeographically, Qinghai is connected to the city of Xining, which is explicitly mentioned in several descriptions as a hub for entomological activity. The province’s ecological diversity, spanning alpine, arid, and grassland environments, likely contributes to the wide range of fly species documented there. While some descriptions focus on specific genera or groups, others highlight individual species, collectively underscoring Qinghai’s importance as a biodiversity hotspot for flies in China. The data reflects both historical records and contemporary observations, emphasizing the province’s role in the study of insect distribution and taxonomy.  \n\nThis summary consolidates all provided information into a cohesive overview, resolving no contradictions as the descriptions align in identifying Qinghai as a central hub for various fly species. The province’s entomological significance is reinforced by its association with multiple genera, including *Phormiata*, *Hypoderma*, and *Chrysomya*, as well as its role as a type locality for certain species. Qinghai’s unique ecosystems and documented insect populations make it a critical area for ecological and taxonomic research in China. (498 words)\",31\n3278,PH.DECUSSATA (STEIN),,1\n3090,西宁,\"\n\nXining is a city located in Qinghai Province, China, in the northwestern region of the country. It serves as the capital of the Haidong administrative region and is known for its high-altitude environment, situated at an elevation of approximately 2,261 meters (7,418 feet) above sea level. The city is a key cultural, economic, and transportation hub in Qinghai, with a history dating back over 2,000 years. Xining is also notable for its proximity to Qinghai Lake, one of the largest saltwater lakes in the world, which lies about 150 kilometers to the west. The region is characterized by its cold, semi-arid climate and is part of the broader Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a geographically and ecologically significant area.  \n\nIn addition to its geographical and cultural importance, Xining is recognized as one of the distribution areas for the genus *Fannia* (斑麻蝇属), a group of small, non-biting flies commonly referred to as scuttle flies. These insects are typically found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide, inhabiting environments such as forests, grasslands, and urban areas. The presence of *Fannia* in Xining underscores the city’s role in supporting diverse ecosystems, despite its high-altitude and arid conditions. This ecological detail aligns with broader studies of Qinghai Province, which has been identified as a region with unique biodiversity due to its varied topography and climate.  \n\nXining’s significance as both a human settlement and a natural habitat is further reflected in its historical and environmental context. The city has been a crossroads for trade and cultural exchange, particularly along the Silk Road, and is home to a mix of Han Chinese, Tibetan, and other ethnic communities. Its economy is driven by industries such as agriculture, mining, and tourism, with nearby attractions like the Qilian Mountains and the Yellow River’s upper reaches drawing visitors. The coexistence of urban development and natural ecosystems in Xining highlights its dual role as a center of human activity and a contributor to regional ecological diversity, including the presence of species like *Fannia*.  \n\nBy integrating its geographical, cultural, and biological attributes, Xining emerges as a multifaceted entity within Qinghai Province, representing both the challenges and opportunities of high-altitude living and the preservation of ecological niches. The city’s inclusion in the distribution range of *Fannia* adds a layer of scientific interest, emphasizing the interplay between human geography and natural habitats in this part of China.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",1\n6111,青海皮蝇,\"青海皮蝇 (Hypoderma qinghaiense) is a fly species with an unknown host, found in China (Shaanxi, Qinghai).
