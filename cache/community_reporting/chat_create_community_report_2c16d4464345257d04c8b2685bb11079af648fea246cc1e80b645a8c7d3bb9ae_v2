Additionally, *Phaonia bysia* is present in North America and is characterized by the absence of premedian bristles. Several *Hydrophoria* species, including *Hydrophoria annulata*, *Hydrophoria ruralis*, and *Hydrophoria striolata*, are found here, as are *Hydrotaea bimaculata*, *Hydrotaea palaestrica*, and *Hydrotaea pilipes*/*Hydrotaea mimopilipes*. The genus *Adia* is also reported in North America as a foreign distribution region.  \n\nNotable species with specific regional references include *Delia hirtitibia*, *Delia flavoscutellata*, *Delia lineariventris*, *Delia planipalpis* (type locality in Idaho, USA), and *Delia longicauda*, *Delia diluta*, *Delia nigribasis* (foreign occurrences). *Pegomya betae*, *Pegomya exilis*, and *Pegomya geniculata* are distributed in the continent, as are *Paraprosalpia pilitarsis* and *Paraprosalpia sepiella*. *Lispe argenteiceps* and *Lispe frigida* are also present, along with *Anthomyia procellaris* and *Alloeostylus lividiventris*.

It is recognized as a key area for biodiversity, hosting a variety of plant and animal species adapted to its unique climatic and environmental conditions. Among the notable organisms found in this region is the **Acklandia genus**, a group of flowering plants within the Asteraceae family, which thrives in the temperate and alpine habitats of Northern Asia. Additionally, the **Amobia signata**, a species of moth in the family Geometridae, is also distributed across this region, contributing to its insect diversity. The presence of both the Acklandia genus and Amobia signata in Northern Asia underscores the area’s ecological significance as a habitat for specialized flora and fauna. These species are part of the broader biota that reflects the region’s role in supporting ecosystems shaped by cold climates and high-altitude environments. While the descriptions provided focus on the distribution of these two entities, they collectively highlight Northern Asia’s importance as a center for biological diversity, particularly for species with specific adaptations to its northern latitudes.
