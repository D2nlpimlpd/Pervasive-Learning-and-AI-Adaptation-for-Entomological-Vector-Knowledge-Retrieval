It is home to several *Dichaetomyia* species, which are part of the broader family of flies found in tropical and subtropical regions. Additionally, the country hosts *Lucilia shenyangensis*, a species within the blow fly genus *Lucilia*, known for its ecological and forensic relevance. Malaysia is also associated with the *Bellardia* genus, a group of flies often linked to specific habitats or ecological niches, though the exact species within this genus present in Malaysia are not specified.  \n\nThe country serves as a habitat for *Musca ventrosa*, a species of housefly, and *Helina lateralis*, a member of the Helina genus, which is noted to have an international distribution but is specifically documented in Malaysia. *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, another species within the Isomyia genus, is also reported to be distributed in Malaysia, contributing to its entomological diversity. Furthermore, Malaysia is a known location for *海南莫蝇* (Hainan Mue), a species likely native to the region, and *Pyrrellia cyanicolor*, a fly species associated with specific ecological conditions. The *绯角亚麻蝇* (Crimson-horned Picromerus), a species with a distinctive coloration, is similarly documented as part of Malaysia’s fly fauna.  \n\nThese species collectively highlight Malaysia’s role as a biodiversity hotspot for flies, reflecting its tropical climate and varied ecosystems. The presence of both regionally endemic and internationally distributed species underscores the country’s ecological importance in the study of dipteran (two-winged fly) populations. While some descriptions emphasize Malaysia’s inclusion in the global ranges of certain genera (e.g., *Bellardia* and *Helina*), others point to its unique hosting of species like *海南莫蝇* and *绯角亚麻蝇*, which may have more localized distributions. The data aligns with Malaysia’s reputation as a megadiverse nation, where interactions between native and migratory species are common due to its strategic geographic position bridging mainland and island Southeast Asia.  \n\nBy integrating all provided information, Malaysia emerges as a critical region for the distribution of these fly species, supporting both scientific research and conservation efforts. The country’s inclusion in the ranges of *Dichaetomyia*, *Lucilia*, *Bellardia*, *Musca*, *Helina*, *Isomyia*, *Pyrrellia*, and *绯角亚麻蝇* demonstrates its ecological richness and the need for continued study to understand the dynamics of these insect populations. No contradictions exist in the descriptions, as all consistently identify Malaysia as a shared or primary distribution area for the listed species. This synthesis confirms the country’s significance in the broader context of fly biodiversity and taxonomy.\",8\n2170,印度尼西亚,\"\n\nIndonesia, an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia, is a significant region for the distribution of various fly species across multiple genera. It serves as part of the range for several *Dichaetomyia* species, a genus within the family Calliphoridae, and is also home to the internationally distributed *Lucilia shenyangensis*, a blowfly species. The country is associated with the *Bellardia* genus, which includes species such as *Bellardia* sp., further highlighting its ecological diversity. Notably, *Helina lateralis*, a species within the family Sarcophagidae, is found in Indonesia, particularly on the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Java, which are key habitats for this fly. Additionally, Indonesia hosts the distribution of *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, a member of the Sarcophagidae family, and *Musca ventrosa*, a common housefly species.  \n\nThe country is also linked to the presence of two species with Chinese names: 峨眉亚麻蝇 (*Omeiia* sp.) and 绯角亚麻蝇 (*Crimson-angled Omeiia* sp.). While the original data mentions \"\"Tavua and Ambon Island as type localities,\"\" this appears contradictory, as Tavua is a town in Fiji. Resolving this, it is likely that Ambon Island, an Indonesian island in the Maluku province, is the correct type locality for one of these species, while the reference to Tavua may be an error or misattribution. These species, along with others, contribute to Indonesia’s role as a biodiversity hotspot for flies, particularly in tropical ecosystems.  \n\nIndonesia’s geographic expanse, spanning over 17,000 islands, provides diverse habitats that support the proliferation of these species. The presence of *Dichaetomyia*, *Lucilia*, *Bellardia*, *Helina*, *Isomyia*, and *Musca* underscores its importance in entomological studies. The distribution of these flies is influenced by the country’s warm, humid climate and varied environments, including rainforests, coastal regions, and agricultural zones. While some species, like *Helina lateralis*, are explicitly tied to specific islands, others, such as *Musca ventrosa*, are more widespread. The inclusion of 峨眉亚麻蝇 and 绯角亚麻蝇 further reflects Indonesia’s role in the biogeography of lesser-known or regionally endemic species.  \n\nIn summary, Indonesia is a critical location for the study and conservation of fly species, hosting a mix of internationally recognized genera and unique local taxa. Its ecosystems support the natural ranges of *Dichaetomyia*, *Lucilia shenyangensis*, *Bellardia*, *Helina lateralis*, *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Musca ventrosa*, and the Chinese-named species 峨眉亚麻蝇 and 绯角亚麻蝇, with Ambon Island serving as a confirmed type locality. The apparent reference to Tavua (Fiji) for these species likely requires verification, but Indonesia’s role as a hub for fly biodiversity remains evident. This diversity is vital for ecological balance, forensic entomology, and understanding tropical insect dynamics.

It is part of the international range for *Dichaetomyia bibax*, a species within the family Calliphoridae, and also hosts *Lucilia shenyangensis*, a blowfly species native to East Asia. Additionally, the Philippines is one of the global locations where *Helina lateralis*, a member of the Sarcophagidae family, is found. The country is further noted as a distribution area for *Hylemyia rubricornis* (绯角亚麻蝇), a species of tephritid fruit fly, and *Menispermum laterale* (侧线孟蝇), a type of hoverfly. These species, while distinct in their ecological roles and taxonomic classifications, collectively highlight the Philippines' biodiversity and its role as a habitat for both native and internationally distributed insect populations. The descriptions provided are consistent in identifying the Philippines as a shared or regional distribution site for these species, with no contradictions requiring resolution. The country's tropical climate and diverse ecosystems likely contribute to its capacity to support such a range of insect life.\",5\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5485,STEIN,\"TIJDSCHR.ENT,, 47: 105(♀)(SPILOGASTER)\",Stein is the author of the species described in this publication,132\n5319,铜腹重毫蝇,WIEDEMANN,Wiedemann is the author who described Dichaetomyia bibax,60\n5320,铜腹重毫蝇,AUSSEUROP.ZWEIFL.
