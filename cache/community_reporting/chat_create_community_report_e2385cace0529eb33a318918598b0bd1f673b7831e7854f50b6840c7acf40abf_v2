The city is specifically linked to *Asiometopia persa*, a species found in the region, as highlighted in multiple descriptions. Additionally, Jining serves as a location where *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi* has been identified, further emphasizing its ecological or paleontological relevance. Another species, *Metopia suifenhoensis*, is also documented as being present in this area, contributing to the biodiversity or fossil record of the region. While the descriptions do not clarify whether these species coexist in the same habitats or time periods, they collectively establish Jining as a key reference point for the study of these organisms. The city’s role in the context of these species appears to be primarily geographical, with its position in Inner Mongolia providing a shared environmental or historical framework. No direct contradictions exist among the descriptions, as they all consistently identify Jining as part of Inner Mongolia, China, and associate it with the presence of the listed species. The summary integrates all provided information to present Jining as a multifaceted location tied to the distribution of *Asiometopia persa*, *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, and *Metopia suifenhoensis*, underscoring its importance in regional biological or paleontological records.\",2\n4433,LINHE,\"\n\n**Linhe** is a city located in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China.
