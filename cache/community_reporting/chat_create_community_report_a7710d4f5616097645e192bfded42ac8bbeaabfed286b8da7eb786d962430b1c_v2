TIDSKR.** (short for *Entomologisk Tidskrift* or *Entomological Tidskrift*) is a Swedish entomology journal that has served as a key publication platform for taxonomic and ecological research on various insect species and genera. The journal has documented multiple significant contributions to entomological science, including the description of the genus *Acrostilpna* by Ringdahl in 1929, which marked an important taxonomic milestone. Additionally, it has been the venue for the formal description of the nominate subspecies *Eutrichota pilimana*, as well as the species *Lispe lanceoseta* and *Hydrophoria zetterstedti*. The journal also features documentation of the genus *Subhylemyia* and the species *Delia brassicaeformis*, further underscoring its role in advancing the classification of flies and other insects. A specific entry in volume 55, page 6, records the documentation of *Paraprosalpia aldrichi*, adding to the journal’s legacy of detailed species reports. While the journal’s name appears in both Swedish (*Entomologisk Tidskrift*) and anglicized (*Entomological Tidskrift*) forms, its content consistently reflects rigorous entomological scholarship, with a focus on regional and global insect biodiversity. The entries highlight its utility for researchers studying Diptera (flies) and other insect groups, as it provides historical and contemporary taxonomic records. The journal’s contributions span decades, with descriptions from the early 20th century (e.g., *Acrostilpna* in 1929) to more recent publications, demonstrating its ongoing relevance in the field. By consolidating these references, *ENT. TIDSKR.* emerges as a critical resource for entomologists, offering a repository of documented species, subspecies, and genera that support both academic research and conservation efforts. Its role in publishing works by notable entomologists like Ringdahl further cements its authority in the discipline. The journal’s comprehensive coverage of insect taxonomy, including both well-known and lesser-studied species, ensures its value as a foundational text for understanding arthropod diversity. Overall, *ENT. TIDSKR.* stands as a testament to the collaborative and cumulative nature of entomological science, bridging historical discoveries with modern advancements.
