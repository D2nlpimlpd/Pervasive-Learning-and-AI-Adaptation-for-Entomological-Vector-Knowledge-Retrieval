These insects are distinguished by their unique morphological traits, including a specialized **proboscis** for feeding and the presence of **genal setae** (upcurved peristomal bristles) in many species. The family encompasses a diverse group of flies, with the **Eristalinae subfamily** being particularly notable for its larvae, which possess a **long, retractable breathing tube**. This feature is a key adaptation for their ecological niche, as these larvae are often found in **human or animal feces**, where the breathing tube allows them to survive in oxygen-poor environments. \n\nWhile the general family is characterized by **3rd instar larvae** with a **long, flexible breathing tube**, the Eristalinae subfamily exhibits a more specialized version of this structure, emphasizing its retractable nature. This distinction highlights the morphological diversity within Syrphidae, which is further supported by the inclusion of \"\"other morphological features\"\" noted in broader descriptions. Hoverflies are ecologically significant, with adults often mimicking bees or wasps for protection, and their larvae playing roles in decomposition and pest control. The family’s classification under Cyclorrhapha aligns with its evolutionary placement among true flies with complex pupal stages. \n\nBy synthesizing these details, Syrphidae is portrayed as a taxonomically and ecologically rich group, with the Eristalinae subfamily representing a specialized subset. The combination of general larval traits (flexible breathing tube) and subfamily-specific adaptations (retractable tube in feces-associated larvae) provides a cohesive understanding of their biology and habitat preferences. This summary integrates all provided descriptions, resolving apparent contradictions by clarifying that the retractable breathing tube is a subfamily-level feature, while the flexible tube is a broader family characteristic.\",2\n6120,ERISTALINAE,\"\n\n**ERISTALINAE** is a subfamily within the **Syrphidae** family, commonly known as hoverflies. This taxonomic group is characterized by its larvae, which possess a distinctive long, retractable breathing tube—a feature critical for their survival in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The larvae are often referred to by the informal common name **\"\"mouse grubs\"\"** due to their elongated, worm-like appearance. Morphologically, they are described as large in size and typically exhibit brown or light brown coloration, which may aid in camouflage or thermoregulation. These traits are consistent across the subfamily, though specific ecological roles or behaviors of individual species are not detailed in the provided data. The subfamily’s classification under Syrphidae aligns with the broader family’s ecological significance, as many hoverflies play vital roles as pollinators in adulthood and as predators or decomposers in their larval stages. The combination of the retractable breathing tube and their coloration distinguishes **Eristalinae** from other Syrphidae subfamilies, such as **Syrphinae**, which lack this specialized larval structure. While the descriptions emphasize larval features, the subfamily’s name and placement within Syrphidae remain unambiguous, reflecting a shared evolutionary lineage with other hoverflies. No contradictions exist in the provided data regarding the subfamily’s classification or larval traits, allowing for a unified summary.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11855,SYRPHIDAE,ERISTALINAE,\"\n\nEristalinae is a subfamily within the Syrphidae family, which is part of the order Diptera (true flies).
