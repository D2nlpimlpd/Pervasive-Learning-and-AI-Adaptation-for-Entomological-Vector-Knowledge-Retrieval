In 1935, he authored the formal description of *Sarcophaga aegyptica*, a species native to Egypt, expanding the scientific understanding of sarcophagid diversity in the region. A decade later, in 1945, Salem further advanced the field by describing *Sarcophaga pilipleuris*, another species within the same genus. These works highlight his expertise in classifying and documenting dipteran insects, particularly those in the *Sarcophaga* genus, which plays a significant role in forensic entomology and ecological studies. While the specific contexts or habitats of these species are not detailed in the provided data, Salem’s publications from these years remain foundational references for researchers studying blow fly morphology, distribution, and systematics.
