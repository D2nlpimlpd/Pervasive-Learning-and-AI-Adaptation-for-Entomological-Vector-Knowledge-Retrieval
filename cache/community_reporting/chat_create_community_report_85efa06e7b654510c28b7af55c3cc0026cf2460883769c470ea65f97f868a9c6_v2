Ackland first described the species *Strobilomyia infrequens* in 1965, with later records of this species in Nepal linked to their work in 1967. In the same year, 1967, Ackland also documented the distribution of *Lasiomma strigilatum* in Nepal, contributing to regional entomological knowledge. Additionally, they described *Hylemya probilis* and *Hylemya vagans* in 1967, both belonging to the genus *Hylemya*. Ackland’s research extended to other species, including *Calythea setifrons*, described in 1986, and *Pamir Pseudomyopina pamirensis*, for which they are credited as the author. Their work is frequently cited in species descriptions and references, indicating a significant role in taxonomic studies. Ackland’s entomological research is notably tied to the UK, as highlighted in the description of *Strobilomyia infrequens*. While some records mention Nepal (e.g., *Strobilomyia infrequens* in 1967 and *Lasiomma strigilatum* in 1967), these appear to reflect subsequent documentation or regional studies rather than original descriptions, as the 1965 date for *Strobilomyia infrequens* is explicitly noted as the year of its initial description.

It belongs to the family Stratiomyidae, commonly known as soldier flies, and is distinguished by specific morphological traits. Notably, species within this genus are characterized by yellow wing shoulder scales, a feature that contributes to their visual identification, and a unique abdominal bristle pattern, which is critical for taxonomic classification. These physical attributes help differentiate *Spallanzania* from other genera within the same family.  \n\nThe genus includes multiple species, one of which is *Spallanzania hebes*, a well-documented example. Members of *Spallanzania* are distributed across diverse geographical regions, with records indicating their presence in Beijing and Heilongjiang in China, as well as in Southern Europe. This distribution suggests a broad ecological adaptability, though specific habitat preferences or life cycle details are not provided in the descriptions. The inclusion of both Eastern Asian and European locations highlights the genus’s potential for wide-ranging biodiversity and ecological significance in these areas.  \n\nAs a group, *Spallanzania* flies are part of the larger order Diptera, which encompasses true flies. Their classification under the Stratiomyidae family aligns with other soldier flies, which are typically associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic environments during their larval stages. However, the descriptions do not elaborate on the ecological roles, behaviors, or larval habitats of *Spallanzania* species. The genus’s defining features—yellow wing shoulder scales and abdominal bristle patterns—are emphasized as key diagnostic markers, underscoring the importance of morphological analysis in entomological studies.  \n\nNo contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the genus’s taxonomic origin, physical traits, and regional distribution. The summary integrates all details to present a cohesive overview of *Spallanzania Genus*, emphasizing its historical classification, morphological uniqueness, and geographic presence. Further research into the genus’s ecological functions, species diversity, and conservation status could enhance understanding of its role in ecosystems and evolutionary biology.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",15\n343,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,\"\n\nROBINEAU-DESVOIDY was a French entomologist and taxonomist active in the 19th century, renowned for his significant contributions to the classification of flies, particularly parasitic species. His work primarily focused on describing and establishing numerous genera and species within the Diptera order, with a notable emphasis on tachinid and other fly families. Key genera attributed to him include *Aplomyia*, *Adia*, *Egenia*, *Eurysthaea*, *Lydella*, *Phryxe*, *Bothria*, *Zenillia*, *Hydrotaea*, *Nemoraea*, *Limosia*, *Caricea*, *Carcelia*, *Helina*, *Morellia*, *Myospila*, *Amobia*, *Norellia*, *Pegomya*, *Spallanzania*, *Cynomya*, *Phormia*, *Pierretia*, *Ravinia*, *Fannia*, *Lucilia*, *Melinda*, *Dasyphora*, *Bengalia*, *Bercaea*, *Cosmina*, *Servaisia*, *Drino*, and *Blondelia*. He also described the subgenus *Pierretia(s.str.)* in 1863.  \n\nAmong the species he described are *Lydella grisescens* (1830), *Lydella maesta* (1863), *Lydella cursoria* (1863), *Phryxe praefixa*, *Phryxe fugitiva*, and *Phryxe vernalis* (1863), as well as *Macquartia laeta* (1863) and *Macquartia villica* (1836). Notable species include *Calliphora vicina* (Red-headed Calliphora), *Delia floricola* (1830), *Emmesomyia grisea*, *Blaesoxipha campestris* (1863), *Peletieria rubescens* (1830), *Myophora peregrina* (1830), *Craspedochoeta liturata* (1830), and *Hylemya strenua* (1830). He also contributed to the taxonomy of *Egle*, including the species *Egle parva*, and *Leucophora sericea* (1830), *Leucophora cinerea* (1830), and *Leucophora* as a genus.  \n\nROBINEAU-DESVOIDY’s work extended to specific species such as *Dexia cincta* and *Dexia gracilis* (1830), *Pollenia* (1830), *Buquetia musca* (1847), *Zenillia* (1830), *Mydaea* and *Myospila* (1830), *Blondelia*, *Meigenia*, *Zaira*, and *Fannia* (1830). He described *Pyrellia vivida* (Horse Manure Greenbottle Fly) and *朔粪泉蝇* (translated as \"\"Red-tailed Blowfly\"\") in 1830, as well as *Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis* and *Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens* (1830). His 1863 contributions include *Eurysthaea scutellaris*, *Servaisia*, *Bercaea*, *Drino*, and *Ravinia*.  \n\nHis taxonomic efforts were instrumental in organizing parasitic fly classifications, with genera like *Lydella*, *Phryxe*, and *Aplomyia* reflecting his focus on morphological traits and ecological roles. ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY’s legacy is preserved in scientific literature through species and genera names, including *Helina euphemioidea*, *Helina punotata*, *Hydrotaea glabricula*, *Hydrotaea velutina*, and *Agria punctata* (1830). Additionally, he described *Bellardia*, *Peribaea*, and *Herbstia*, further underscoring his broad impact on entomological taxonomy.  \n\nAs a 19th-century scientist, ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY’s work laid foundational groundwork for modern studies of flies, particularly in the Palearctic region. His meticulous descriptions and establishment of genera remain critical references in dipteran systematics. The contradictions in the data, such as overlapping years for certain genera, are resolved by consolidating all cited works under his active periods (1830 and 1863) and emphasizing his role as a primary describer. His contributions are widely recognized in both Western and Chinese entomological contexts, as seen in the description of *棕尾别麻蝇* (Red-tailed Blowfly) and other species. ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY’s career exemplifies the era’s dedication to cataloging biodiversity, with his work continuing to inform taxonomic research today.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",112\n5523,ZAIRA,\"Zaira is a genus of parasitic flies characterized by ovoviviparous reproduction.

The genus is distributed in Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Beijing, Qinghai (Yushu), Japan, and Europe. Its morphological features include a head with specific bristle patterns and a body covered in gray powder. The genus was described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830.\",12\n4813,PIERRETI,\"\n\n**Pierretia** is a genus of flies within the family Sarcophagidae, first described by the French entomologist Émile Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863. The type species of the genus is *Sarcophaga nigriventris*, which serves as the foundational reference for its classification. Pierretia is notable for its distinct morphological features, including the absence of bristles on the r1 vein of the wings, a characteristic that differentiates it from closely related genera. Additionally, the genus exhibits unevenly spaced posterior median notopleura (a structure on the thorax), and its male reproductive anatomy is marked by a long phallus with fine, elongated parameres. These traits are critical for taxonomic identification and underscore the genus’s unique evolutionary adaptations.  \n\nThe genus has undergone taxonomic revisions, with *Mehria* and *Ascelotella* recognized as synonyms. This indicates that species previously classified under these names have been reclassified into Pierretia, consolidating the group’s diversity. Ecologically, Pierretia species play a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling, as their larvae are known to feed on feces or carrion. This habit aligns them with other flesh flies, which are often associated with such environments. Their distribution spans the Palaearctic and Oriental regions, suggesting a wide geographic range across temperate and tropical zones.  \n\nBy integrating morphological, taxonomic, and ecological data, Pierretia is characterized as a well-defined genus with specific anatomical markers, a historical taxonomic lineage, and a functional role in ecosystems. Its classification and traits reflect both its evolutionary distinctiveness and ecological significance.\",10\n5392,ACTIA NIGROSCUTELLATA,Species of tachinid fly described by Lundbeck in 1927,15\n2735,LIMNOPHORA NIGRIPES,\"A fly species with a black abdominal stripe and gray facial markings, described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830, found in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Europe, and North America\",9\n4556,METOPIA SAUTERI,,6\n2013,PYRELLIA,,8\n1069,LEUCOPHORA SERICEA,\"\n\nLeucophora sericea is a species of fly (Diptera) first described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. It is characterized by a body length ranging between 6.0–7.5 mm, with some sources specifying a more precise range of 6.5–7.5 mm and others noting a typical length of 6 mm. The species exhibits distinct morphological features, including specific bristle patterns that aid in its identification. Geographically, Leucophora sericea is distributed across several regions: domestically in China, it has been recorded in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hebei, and Qinghai. Internationally, its range extends to Japan and France, the latter of which is noted as the type locality—the original location where the species was first described. The combination of its bristle patterns and body size measurements provides key diagnostic traits for distinguishing it from related species within the genus *Leucophora*. Despite minor discrepancies in reported body lengths, the consensus places it within the 6–7.5 mm range, reflecting natural variation or potential differences in measurement methods. This species is part of the broader ecological and taxonomic context of flies, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitats.\",7\n1317,CALYTHEA NIGRICANS,\"\n\n**Calythea nigricans** is a species of fly belonging to the family Anthomyiidae, which includes root flies rather than flower flies. It was first described by the entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830, though an earlier source erroneously attributes its description to \"\"R.-D.\"\" in 1825. The species is characterized by a distinct morphological feature in males: a single row of lower orbital bristles, and adults typically measure 3.5 mm in body length. \n\nLarvae of *Calythea nigricans* are known to breed in the dung of domestic animals, specifically pigs and cows, as noted in the first description. This ecological trait aligns with the general habits of Anthomyiidae, which often utilize decaying organic matter for larval development. \n\nIn terms of distribution, *Calythea nigricans* is found in several regions. Domestically, it occurs in China, with records from the cities of Beijing, Sichuan, and Shanghai. Internationally, its range extends to Southwest Asia, Europe (including France), North Africa, and both North and South America. This broad geographic presence suggests the species is well-adapted to temperate and subtropical climates, though specific ecological preferences or host associations beyond dung-breeding remain unmentioned in the provided data. \n\nThe discrepancy in the description’s authorship and year (1825 vs. 1830) has been resolved by prioritizing the full name \"\"Robineau-Desvoidy\"\" and the later, more precise date of 1830, which is consistent with historical taxonomic records. The family classification as Anthomyiidae is retained, as the initial reference to \"\"flower fly\"\" appears to be an error, given that flower flies belong to the family Syrphidae. \n\nIn summary, *Calythea nigricans* is a small, bristle-marked root fly with a global distribution spanning multiple continents and a larval ecology tied to livestock dung. Its taxonomic history and morphological traits highlight its role within the Anthomyiidae family, while its widespread occurrence underscores its adaptability to diverse environments.\",6\n3758,CALLIPHORA VICINA,\"\n\n**Calliphora vicina**, commonly known as the Red-headed Calliphora, is a species of blowfly first described by the entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy.

This genus is part of the Palaearctic region’s biodiversity, which encompasses a wide geographic range including Europe, Asia north of the Himalayas, and North Africa. Members of the Cynomya genus are characterized by their metallic blue or green coloration, a common trait among many blow flies and hover flies, which often serves as a form of aposematic or mimetic adaptation. Morphologically, they exhibit features typical of the Calliphoridae family, such as robust bodies, prominent eyes, and a distinct pattern of wing venation. These flies are primarily known for their role in forensic entomology, as certain species are early colonizers of decaying organic matter, aiding in the estimation of postmortem intervals. Additionally, their ecological significance extends to decomposition processes and nutrient cycling in various habitats. The genus is taxonomically distinct, with species often identified by specific anatomical traits, including the structure of the proboscis and the arrangement of setae on the thorax and abdomen. While the descriptions provided align on the family classification and physical attributes, the Palaearctic distribution emphasizes their prevalence in temperate and subtropical zones, though some species may extend into adjacent regions. Overall, Cynomya represents a well-defined group within the Calliphoridae family, notable for its metallic coloration, morphological specialization, and ecological roles in decomposition and forensic science.\",3\n4681,SERVAISIA,\"A genus of flies described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863, part of the Protodexiini and Servaisiini tribes\",3\n5739,ELODIA,\"\n\n**ELODIA** is a genus of tachinid flies (family Tachinidae) within the Eryciini tribe, first described by the French entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863. The genus is characterized by morphological features such as the structure of the fifth radial cell near the wing tip, which may be either open or closed, and distinct bristle arrangements on the scutellum, a triangular plate on the thorax. These traits help distinguish *ELODIA* from other genera in the tribe.  \n\nTwo notable species within the genus are *Elodia ambulatoria* and *Elodia morio*. These species are further differentiated by variations in abdominal patterns and their specific host relationships. For example, *E. ambulatoria* and *E. morio* exhibit unique adaptations to parasitize particular host insects, a common ecological strategy among tachinid flies. The genus is part of the broader Tachinidae family, which includes parasitic flies that play significant roles in controlling insect populations.  \n\nThe taxonomic placement of *ELODIA* in the Eryciini tribe highlights its evolutionary relationships with other tachinid genera, such as *Erycia* and *Exorista*. While the first description emphasizes wing venation and scutellar bristles as key diagnostic traits, the second underscores the importance of abdominal markings and host specificity in species identification. Together, these details provide a comprehensive understanding of the genus, bridging morphological and ecological characteristics.  \n\nRobineau-Desvoidy’s original work established *ELODIA* as a distinct taxonomic group, and subsequent studies have expanded its known diversity and biological roles. The genus remains a subject of interest for entomologists due to its specialized traits and ecological contributions. By integrating morphological, behavioral, and host-related data, researchers continue to refine the classification and study of *ELODIA* species within the Tachinidae family.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",3\n5755,EURYSTHAEAE,\"\n\n**Eurysthaea** is a genus of flies within the family Tachinidae, first described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1848.
