It is home to a diverse array of dipteran insects, including *Pygophora respondens*, *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina cuprina*, *Caiusa testacea*, and *Anthomyia plumiseta*. The country hosts multiple *Musca* species such as *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, and *Musca seniorwhitei*, as well as *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Argyrophylax phoeda*, and *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*. Notably, *Dichaetomyia* species, including *Dichaetomyia luteiventr*is, *Dichaetomyia aureomarginata*, *Dichaetomyia apicalis*, *Dichaetomyia flavoca*udata, and *Dichaetomyia pallicornis*, are found in Malaysia, with some species having the country as their type locality. Additionally, *Dichaetomyia quadrata* is explicitly documented as distributed there.  \n\nMalaysia is also associated with the *Tainanina* genus, where *Tainanina pilisquama* and *Tainanina sarcophagoides* are recorded. The *Bengalia* and *Cosmina limbipennis* species are present, alongside *Fannia canicularis*, *Isomyia cupreoviridis*, *Isomyia isomyia*, and *Paradichosia scutellata*. The *Sturmiopsis inferens* and *Atherigona exigua* species are distributed in Malaysia, with the latter having the country as both a distribution site and a type locality. *Chlororhinia exempta* is specifically noted in Sarawak, while *Lasiopelta longicornis* is documented in the broader Southeast Asian context that includes Malaysia.  \n\nThe country is linked to the Indian greenbottle fly (*Lucilia cuprina cuprina*) and the Star Island Greenbottle Fly, though the latter’s \"\"foreign location\"\" descriptor likely reflects a typographical inconsistency, as Malaysia is a primary location for these species. Similarly, references to \"\"foreign distribution records\"\" for *Musca crassirostris* and \"\"type locality of ZONGQUAN YANGYING\"\" may require contextual clarification but are retained as part of the provided data. Malaysia is further associated with the *Halydaia* and *Linnaemya* genera, as well as the *Neomyia* and *Stomorhina* genera, which are described as having international or foreign distribution ties to the country.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively highlight Malaysia’s role as a biodiversity hotspot for flies, with specific regions like the Malay Peninsula, Kalimantan, and Singapore (as a type locality) playing key roles in the distribution of certain species. While some entries redundantly state \"\"Malaysia is a country where the species is distributed,\"\" the unique species and genera listed underscore the country’s ecological importance in entomological studies. The capital, Kuala Lumpur, is mentioned as part of Malaysia’s geographical identity but is not directly tied to the species distribution data.  \n\nIn summary, Malaysia serves as a critical habitat for a wide range of fly species, including multiple *Dichaetomyia*, *Musca*, and *Tainanina* species, as well as the *Winthemia* genus and others like *Isomyia* and *Paradichosia*. Its diverse ecosystems, spanning the Malay Peninsula and Bornean regions, support both endemic and internationally distributed species, making it a focal point for research on dipteran taxonomy and ecology. Contradictory terms such as \"\"foreign location\"\" are resolved by emphasizing Malaysia’s direct role as a primary distribution site for these species.\",29\n2109,KUALA LUMPUR,\"\n\nKuala Lumpur is the capital city of Malaysia and a major urban center within the country. It is recognized as the type locality for the mosquito species *Isomyia cupreoviridis*, which was first described in this region. The city is also explicitly identified as a location in Malaysia, emphasizing its geographical and administrative significance. Furthermore, a site 20 kilometers west of Kuala Lumpur is noted as the habitat where *Musca asiatica*, a species of fly, is found. This proximity highlights the city's role as a reference point for entomological studies, linking it to both the type locality of *Isomyia cupreoviridis* and the distribution of *Musca asiatica*. While the descriptions concur on Kuala Lumpur's status as the capital and its association with *Isomyia cupreoviridis*, the mention of *Musca asiatica* being located 20 km west introduces a secondary ecological context. The summary resolves any implied contradiction by clarifying that the type locality for *Isomyia cupreoviridis* is within Kuala Lumpur itself, whereas *Musca asiatica* is documented in a nearby area to the west. As the capital, Kuala Lumpur serves as a critical hub for scientific documentation, biodiversity research, and administrative functions, further solidifying its importance in both geographical and biological contexts. Its dual role as a type locality and a regional reference for adjacent species underscores its relevance in entomological and ecological studies. The city's prominence in Malaysia, combined with these specific biological associations, provides a comprehensive understanding of its multifaceted significance.\",4\n3193,HELINA BRUNNEIGENA,\"A species of fly described by Emden in 1965, found in Guangdong (Shantou, Zhanjiang) and internationally in Malaysia (mode origin).
