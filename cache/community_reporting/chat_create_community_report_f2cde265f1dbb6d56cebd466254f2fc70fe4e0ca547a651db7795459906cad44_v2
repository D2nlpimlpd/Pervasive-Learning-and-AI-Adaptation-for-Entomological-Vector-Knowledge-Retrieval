(499 words)\",196\n876,SYST.BESCHR.,\"\n\n**SYST.BESCHR.** (likely an abbreviation for *Systematische Beschreibung*, a German term meaning \"\"Systematic Description\"\") is a publication historically used for the taxonomic description and classification of various insect species, particularly within the order Diptera (flies). The journal has served as a platform for entomologists to document new species and their initial taxonomic placements. Among the species associated with this publication are *Pegoplata virginea*, which was first described in 1826 under the genus *Anthomyia*; *Botanophila varicolor*, referenced in the journal; *Pegohylemyia fugax*, described within its pages; *Pseudonupedia intersecta*, detailed in SYST.BESCHR. with its original classification also under *Anthomyia*; and *Hylemya partita*, another species formally described in the same publication. These entries highlight the journal’s role in early 19th-century entomology, particularly in the systematic study of flies, where species were often reclassified over time as taxonomic understanding evolved. For instance, *Pegoplata virginea* and *Pseudonupedia intersecta* were initially placed in *Anthomyia*, a genus that has since been revised, with these species moved to their current genera. The journal’s contributions to dipteran taxonomy are notable for establishing foundational records, even as subsequent research has refined their classifications. SYST.BESCHR. remains a key historical source for understanding the nomenclatural history and phylogenetic relationships of these species. Its descriptions provide critical baseline data for modern taxonomists to trace the evolution of scientific naming conventions and ecological insights into these fly species. The publication’s focus on systematic biology underscores its importance in the broader context of biodiversity documentation during its active period. While specific dates for all species are not provided, the 1826 reference for *Pegoplata virginea* situates SYST.BESCHR. as a 19th-century resource, aligning with the era’s emphasis on formalizing biological classifications. The inclusion of multiple species across different genera (e.g., *Pegohylemyia*, *Pseudonupedia*, *Hylemya*) suggests the journal covered a range of dipteran families, contributing to the taxonomic framework of the time. Overall, SYST.BESCHR. exemplifies the iterative nature of scientific classification, where initial groupings are later adjusted based on new evidence, and its records remain valuable for both historical and contemporary entomological research.\",6\n864,HYLEMIA PARTITA,\"A species of fly described by Meigen in 1826, found in China and Europe\",5\n954,QIQIHAER,\"\n\nQiqihar (also spelled Qiqihaer) is a city located in Heilongjiang province, China.

These associations highlight YICHUN WUYING’s ecological and taxonomic importance, particularly for documenting biodiversity in the fly family Muscidae and related groups. All descriptions consistently identify the entity as a site in Heilongjiang, with no contradictions in location or species associations. The data underscores its role as a reference point for entomologists studying these species’ distributions and classifications.\",9\n1947,BONSDORFF,\"\n\n**BONSDORFF** is an entomologist and author who described the species *Polietes nigrolimbata* in 1866. As an entomologist, BONSDORFF contributed to the scientific classification and documentation of this species, which is part of the broader field of insect taxonomy. The description of *Polietes nigrolimbata* highlights BONSDORFF’s role in advancing entomological knowledge during the 19th century, a period marked by significant exploration and cataloging of biodiversity. The species *Polietes nigrolimbata* is likely a beetle, given the genus *Polietes* is commonly associated with the family Cerambycidae (longhorn beetles), though the specific ecological or geographic context of the species is not detailed in the provided data. BONSDORFF’s work as both an author and entomologist underscores their dual contributions to entomology through research and scholarly writing. While the descriptions do not clarify whether BONSDORFF is a single individual or a collective name (e.g., a team or institution), the consistent mention of the 1866 publication year and the species *Polietes nigrolimbata* across both entries suggests a unified reference to a specific entomological contribution. Further details about BONSDORFF’s other works, geographic focus, or institutional affiliations are not included in the provided data, but their 1866 description remains a notable record in the study of beetles. The lack of conflicting information in the descriptions allows for a coherent summary of their role in entomology.\",1\n3568,CHINESE COMMON FLIES REFERENCE (FIRST EDITION),\"A reference book documenting common fly species in China, including taxonomic descriptions and distribution data\",4\n1349,NORTH EUROPE,Region where Paraprosalpia denticauda and other species are distributed,7\n3577,GUANGZE,\"Location in Fujian, China, associated with *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum*\",1\n3584,YINGKOU TIANZHUANGTAI,\"Location in Liaoning, China, associated with *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) chini*\",1\n3583,JIAN,\"Location in Jilin, China, associated with *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) chini*\",1\n670,ACKLANDIA CURVATA,,7\n665,ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH COLLECTION,\"\n\nThe **ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH COLLECTION** is a Chinese journal dedicated to the publication of entomological research, including the description of new species and taxonomic studies. It has served as a platform for documenting discoveries in insect biodiversity and related ecological or systematic work. Among its notable contributions, the journal published the species *Delia canalis* and *Delia felsicanalis*, which are likely within the family Anthomyiidae (flower flies), though specific details about their classification or habitats are not provided in the descriptions. Additionally, it has featured descriptions of other species, such as *Egle cyrtacra* and *Acklandia aculeatoides*, further underscoring its role in advancing knowledge of insect taxonomy. The journal is also recognized for introducing the genus *Alliopsis* in 1983, marking a significant milestone in its history. While the descriptions do not clarify whether the ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH COLLECTION is a standalone journal or part of a broader publication series, its content consistently reflects a focus on entomological science, particularly in the context of species discovery and classification. The journal’s multilingual or international scope is implied by the inclusion of species names that may originate from diverse geographic regions, though its primary association with Chinese research is emphasized. By consolidating these examples, the ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH COLLECTION appears to be a key resource for entomologists, especially those studying dipteran insects and plant-insect interactions, as evidenced by the genera and species highlighted. Its historical significance is further reinforced by the 1983 description of *Alliopsis*, which likely represents a foundational contribution to the understanding of a specific insect lineage. Overall, the journal combines regional and global relevance in entomology, bridging taxonomic research with broader ecological or agricultural implications. The descriptions provided do not contain direct contradictions, but the entity’s name and the examples of published works suggest it is a specialized, peer-reviewed journal rather than a physical collection of specimens. This clarification aligns the entity with standard academic publishing practices, where \"\"collection\"\" may refer to a compilation of research articles rather than a literal archive. The ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH COLLECTION thus functions as a scholarly outlet for entomological studies, contributing to both local and international scientific discourse through the documentation of new taxa and their biological contexts.\",5\n675,CUI ET FAN,Cui and Fan are the co-authors who described the species Acklandia aculeatoides and Acklandia curvata in 1983,2\n681,JIANCHANG HEISHAN,\"Jianchang Heishan is a location in Liaoning, China, where Acklandia curvata is distributed\",1\n669,ACKLANDIA ACULEATOIDES,,5\n601,CZERNY,\"\n\nCZERNY is a researcher associated with the description of multiple species, primarily in the field of entomology. In 1906, Czerny described the species *Strobilomyia anthracinum*, which is one of the key contributions attributed to him. The same year, he was also linked to the species *Chortophila anthracina*, though the exact nature of his involvement (e.g., description, classification, or study) is not explicitly clarified in the provided data. Additionally, Czerny is credited as the author of *Pegohylemyia sanctimarci*, originally described in the journal *Wiener Entomologische Zeitung* (Wien. Ent. Zeitg.). This species, like the others, appears to be part of his work on insect taxonomy.  \n\nFurther, Czerny is noted as a scholar who described the species *Phaonia pullata* (referred to as \"\"Ph. pullata\"\" in the data) and other related taxa. The inclusion of \"\"等物种\"\" (\"\"and others\"\") in the Chinese description suggests his work extended beyond the explicitly named species, though specific details about these additional contributions are not provided. The consistency in the years and publications across the descriptions indicates that Czerny’s taxonomic work was active in the early 20th century, particularly in 1906, when he documented *Strobilomyia anthracinum* and *Chortophila anthracina*.  \n\nThe descriptions do not present direct contradictions but require synthesis to clarify the scope of Czerny’s contributions. For instance, while *Strobilomyia anthracinum* and *Chortophila anthracina* are both tied to 1906, the latter’s connection to Czerny is phrased as \"\"associated with,\"\" which could imply either a direct description or a secondary role in its study. However, the repeated mention of *Strobilomyia anthracinum* in two separate descriptions (1906 and a general association) supports the conclusion that this species was definitively described by Czerny. The Chinese description adds *Phaonia pullata* to his list of described species, though the year for this contribution is unspecified.  \n\nIn summary, Czerny is recognized for his work in describing and classifying several insect species, including *Strobilomyia anthracinum* (1906), *Chortophila anthracina* (1906), *Pegohylemyia sanctimarci* (in *Wiener Entomologische Zeitung*), and *Phaonia pullata*. His research, spanning the early 1900s, reflects a focus on entomological taxonomy, with notable publications in specialized journals. The lack of detailed dates for some species and the ambiguity in the role of *Chortophila anthracina* are resolved by emphasizing the confirmed descriptions and contextualizing the others as part of his broader scholarly activity.\",5\n619,STROBILOMYIA ANTHRACINUM,Strobilomyia anthracinum is a species of fly described by Czerny in 1906,1\n676,TA HE,\"Ta He is the type locality in Heilongjiang, China, for Acklandia aculeatoides\",1\n874,INSECT STUDIES JOURNAL,Publication referenced for Hylemya partita,1\n1220,WIEEN ENT ZEITG,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n6570,LUCILIA (BUFOLUCILIA) CHINI,FAN,Fan described the species *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) chini* in 1965,305\n1987,PARAPROSALPIA DELIOIDES,FAN,Fan described the species Paraprosalpia delioides in 1983,301\n2007,PARAPROSALPIA LUTEBASICOSTA,JAPAN,Japan is an international distribution location for Paraprosalpia lutebasicosta,229\n2002,PARAPROSALPIA BILLBERGI,JAPAN,Japan is an international distribution location for Paraprosalpia billbergi,227\n568,HEILONGJIANG,STROBILOMYIA LARICICOLA,Strobilomyia laricicola is distributed in Heilongjiang,207\n1049,SYST.BESCHR.,HEILONGJIANG,\"\n\nThe journal *Syst.
