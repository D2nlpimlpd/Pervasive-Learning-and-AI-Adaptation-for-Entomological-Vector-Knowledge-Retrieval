This individual is specifically noted for their work in collecting adult specimens of the species across diverse ecological settings, including orchards, forests, cultivated lands, grasslands, animal carcasses, sheep pens, and indoor environments. The study, which focused on the biology, distribution, or behavior of *Eudasyphora cyanicolor*, was likely part of entomological research in the Xinjiang region, where the researcher's fieldwork involved systematic sampling in both natural and human-modified habitats. The 1981 citation highlights their contribution to understanding the species' ecological preferences and potential interactions with agricultural or pastoral systems, given the inclusion of sites like sheep pens and cultivated areas. While the exact findings of the study are not detailed, the breadth of collection locations suggests a comprehensive approach to documenting the fly's habitat range and life cycle. The entity \"\"钱\"\" thus represents a scholar whose work in the early 1980s advanced knowledge of *Eudasyphora cyanicolor* in China, particularly in Xinjiang, through field-based research and taxonomic analysis. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both emphasize the researcher's role in the 1981 study and their field collection activities. The summary integrates these details to reflect their contributions to entomology in the specified region and timeframe.\"\"  \n\n(Word count: 150)\",5\n358,西藏,\"\n\nTibet (西藏), an autonomous region in China, is a significant distribution area for various fly species. The region hosts the Chinese endemic species *Dichaetomyia bibax*, as well as *Aplomyia*, a genus of flies. It is also home to 瘦喙近脉花蝇 (slender-billed near-veined flower fly) and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*. Notably, Tibet serves as a domestic distribution location for *Delia echinata* and the species 1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇 (1464 Sumatran narrow-cheeked parasitic fly), with the latter’s catalog number included in its name. The region supports Dasyphora species, and Rypellia (possibly a typo for *Pyrellia*; clarification needed) is documented in multiple locations, including Linzhi, Bomi Yigong, Cayu, Bomi, and Baxiong Ranwu. \n\nTibet is part of the distribution range for 黑瓣莫蝇 (*Pyrellia cyanicolor*), a species whose name appears in both Chinese and Latin. The autonomous region is also a key habitat for 兔裸皮蝇 (hare skin fly) in China’s southwest and 紫鼻狂蝇 (purple-nosed horn fly). Additionally, it is the type locality for 角板鬃粪蝇 (horned plate bristle fly), with the specific site being Aasan Tree (亚东阿桑树) in Subeast (Subeast may refer to a local area or a misrendered term; further verification required). The region is explicitly noted as the domestic distribution area for 西藏疣麻蝇 (*Sarcophaga tibetana*, 1289), a species named after Tibet. \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to Tibet as a \"\"province,\"\" this is inaccurate; it is officially an autonomous region. The data collectively highlight Tibet’s ecological role in supporting diverse fly populations, including both endemic and regionally distributed species. Specific localities within Tibet, such as Linzhi and Bomi Yigong, are critical for certain genera like Rypellia. The inclusion of scientific names in both Chinese and Latin (e.g., *Pyrellia cyanicolor* for 黑瓣莫蝇) underscores the region’s importance in entomological studies. Catalog numbers (e.g., 1464, 1289) suggest these species are part of formal taxonomic records. Overall, Tibet’s unique environment contributes to the biodiversity of flies, with implications for ecological and agricultural research in China’s southwest. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",14\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3839,钱,内蒙古,钱 conducted research on Rypellia in Inner Mongolia,38\n1532,瘦喙近脉花蝇,西藏,The species 瘦喙近脉花蝇 is distributed in Tibet,19\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
