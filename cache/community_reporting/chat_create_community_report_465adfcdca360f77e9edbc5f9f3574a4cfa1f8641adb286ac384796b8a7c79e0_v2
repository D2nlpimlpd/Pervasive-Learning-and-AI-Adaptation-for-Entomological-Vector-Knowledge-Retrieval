He described **Lyperosia flavohirta** in 1910, a species within the genus *Lyperosia*. In 1924, Brunetti documented **海南粪泉蝇** (*Hainan Feces Pond Fly*), a species native to Hainan, China. Additionally, he is credited as the author of **Limnophora himalayensis**, a species in the genus *Limnophora*, and **Emmesomyia kemp**, though the latter’s publication year is unspecified. Brunetti’s work also includes being cited in the taxonomic history of the genus *Stomoxys*, which encompasses species such as the stable fly (*Stomoxys calcitrans*). His research spanned multiple insect families and geographic regions, reflecting a broad expertise in entomology. Despite the lack of detailed records for some contributions, his role in describing these species and their classification remains significant in the field. Brunetti’s publications from 1910 to 1924 highlight his active involvement in early 20th-century taxonomic studies, particularly in documenting biodiversity in Asia and the Himalayas. His legacy persists through the scientific names he assigned, which continue to be referenced in entomological literature.\",5\n1518,海南粪泉蝇,\"海南粪泉蝇 (Emmesomyia kempi) is a species of fly described by Brunetti in 1924, characterized by specific morphological features such as the length of the posterior spiracles and coloration of the femora.
