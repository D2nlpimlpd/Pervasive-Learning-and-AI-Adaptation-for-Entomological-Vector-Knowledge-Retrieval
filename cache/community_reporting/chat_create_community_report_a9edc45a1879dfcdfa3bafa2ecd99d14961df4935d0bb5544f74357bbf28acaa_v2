Additionally, Xinyuan serves as the **type locality** for *Pegomya crinilamella*, meaning it is the specific location where this species was first identified and described. The region’s biodiversity is further highlighted by its role as a sublocation in Xinjiang where *Heteronychia heptapotamica* is documented. While the descriptions emphasize Xinyuan’s connection to these species, they collectively underscore its importance as a hub for studying dipteran (true fly) and other insect populations in the broader Xinjiang area. The repeated references to Xinjiang as the overarching region align with the data, and no contradictions exist in the entity’s identification as a county or its ecological associations.
