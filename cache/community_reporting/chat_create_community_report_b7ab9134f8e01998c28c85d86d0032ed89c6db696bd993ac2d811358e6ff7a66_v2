The report examines the **breeding patterns** of this species within the region, providing insights into its population dynamics, reproductive behaviors, and ecological interactions specific to the Hebei environment. As part of entomological research, the study likely aimed to understand the species' life cycle, habitat preferences, and potential impact on local ecosystems or agriculture. The report is notable for its detailed analysis of **Fannia leucosticta** in 1965, a period when systematic biological surveys were being conducted in China to catalog and study insect populations. While the primary subject is the species' breeding habits, the broader context of the report may include environmental conditions in Hebei during that year, which could influence the observed patterns. The work by Gao Jingming contributes to the historical record of entomological studies in China, offering foundational data for future research on this species. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align to define the report’s focus on **Fannia leucosticta** and its reproductive behaviors in Hebei Province. The summary integrates the author, year, location, and subject matter to present a cohesive overview of the report’s purpose and content.\",5\n4839,HEBEI PROVINCE,\"\n\n**Hebei Province** is a region in northern China that has been the focus of entomological research, particularly in the study of fly species. The province is home to **Qinhuangdao**, a coastal city where the **Leucomyia cinerea** fly is known to be distributed. This information highlights Hebei's ecological significance as a habitat for diverse fly populations. Additionally, in 1965, **Gao Jingming** conducted a notable report on **Fannia leucosticta** within the province, contributing to the understanding of this species' biology or distribution. The same year, Gao Jingming also studied **fly larvae** in Hebei, though the specific focus of this research is not detailed in the descriptions. These studies underscore Hebei Province's role as a site for scientific inquiry into dipteran insects, with historical records from the mid-20th century providing foundational data for entomological research in the region. The combination of modern distribution observations (e.g., Leucomyia cinerea) and historical studies (e.g., Fannia leucosticta and larvae research) illustrates the province's ongoing relevance to the field. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all references align with Hebei's identity as a Chinese province and its association with Gao Jingming's 1965 work. The descriptions collectively emphasize Hebei's ecological and scientific importance in the context of fly species and larval studies.\",3\n2340,GAO JINGMING,\"\n\n**GAO JINGMING** is a Chinese researcher and scientist known for his contributions to entomology, particularly in the study of fly species and their taxonomy. His work spans multiple decades, with significant studies conducted in the 1960s and 1980s. In 1965, Gao Jingming authored or co-authored several reports and studies focused on fly species in **Hebei Province**, China. These works included research on blowfly taxonomy, fly larvae, larval activity, and the breeding patterns of species such as *Fannia leucosticta*. His findings were published in notable journals, including the *Journal of Animal Taxonomy* and the *Acta Zoologica Sinica*, where he collaborated with others on a study in the latter publication. The 1965 studies highlighted his expertise in analyzing both adult and larval stages of flies, contributing to the understanding of their ecological roles and taxonomic classifications in the region.  \n\nGao Jingming’s research extended beyond Hebei, as he was also involved in a 1981 study in **Liaoning Province**, though the specific focus of this work is not detailed in the provided data. In 1983, he conducted a study on the genus *Neomyia*, further demonstrating his specialization in fly taxonomy and systematics. His career reflects a sustained interest in the biodiversity and biological characteristics of flies, with a particular emphasis on species relevant to Chinese ecosystems. While the descriptions do not clarify whether he worked independently or as part of a larger team in all instances, his co-authorship of the 1965 *Acta Zoologica Sinica* study suggests collaborative efforts in at least one major publication.  \n\nThe data collectively position Gao Jingming as a key figure in mid-to-late 20th-century entomological research in China, with a focus on regional fly species and their developmental biology. His work in Hebei Province during 1965, which addressed taxonomy, larval activity, and species-specific observations, laid foundational insights for subsequent studies in the field. The 1983 study on *Neomyia* further underscores his long-term engagement with fly classification. Despite the lack of detailed information on the 1981 Liaoning study, his career trajectory indicates a broad geographical and taxonomic scope. No contradictions exist in the provided descriptions, as they align on his roles as a researcher, author, and contributor to entomological science in China. Gao Jingming’s publications in both specialized and broader zoological journals highlight his integration into the scientific community, advancing knowledge of fly species through meticulous documentation and analysis.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",8\n6145,PARASITOLOGY GROUP OF HEBEI MEDICAL COLLEGE,Group associated with a 1965 report on species in Hebei,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11882,JINZHOU CITY HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,1965 REPORT IN HEBEI,The station conducted the 1965 report in Hebei,17\n9121,HEBEI PROVINCE,LEUCOMYIA CINEREUS,Leucomyia cinerea is distributed in Hebei Province,15\n3952,GAO JINGMING,NEOMYIA,Gao Jingming studied the genus Neomyia in 1983,14\n11902,PARASITOLOGY GROUP OF HEBEI MEDICAL COLLEGE,1965 REPORT IN HEBEI,The group contributed to the 1965 report in Hebei,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
