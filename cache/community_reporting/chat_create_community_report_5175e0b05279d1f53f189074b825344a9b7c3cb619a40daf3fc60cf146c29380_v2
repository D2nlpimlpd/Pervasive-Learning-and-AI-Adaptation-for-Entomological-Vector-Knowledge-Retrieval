This taxonomic group is characterized by the presence of multiple species, which are distributed across various regions globally. The genus is part of the broader family of flies, though specific family-level classification is not detailed in the provided descriptions. Its inclusion in the tribe Limnophorini situates it within a well-defined evolutionary and ecological context, as this tribe is known for its diverse and often regionally specialized members. The species within *LIMNOPHORA* exhibit a range of adaptations to their habitats, contributing to their widespread distribution. While the descriptions do not specify the exact number of species or their geographic locations, they collectively emphasize the genus’s taxonomic significance and ecological presence. Robineau-Desvoidy’s original description in 1830 established the foundational classification for this group, which has since been expanded to include multiple species identified in different regions. The genus remains a subject of study for its role in entomological taxonomy and its potential ecological interactions. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the genus’s tribal classification, describer, and the existence of multiple species with regional distribution.\",4\n2651,LIMNOPHORINI,A tribe of flies partially included in the subfamily Coenosiinae,6\n2652,HELIOPHORA,\"A genus of fly within the tribe Limnophorini, described by Malloch in 1921\",1\n2654,PSEUDOLIMNOPHORA,\"A genus of fly within the tribe Limnophorini, described by Strobl in 1893\",1\n2655,NEOLIMNOPHORA,\"A genus of fly within the tribe Limnophorini, described by Schnabl and Dziedzicki in 1911\",1\n2703,TATE,Author who reported on aquatic fly larvae in 1939,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4707,SCHNABL,SPILOGONA,Schnabl described the genus Spilogona,40\n4789,LIMNOPHORA,HELINA,Both genera are compared in the text regarding morphological characteristics,11\n4712,LIMNOPHORINI,HELIOPHORA,Heliographa is a genus within the tribe Limnophorini,7\n4714,LIMNOPHORINI,PSEUDOLIMNOPHORA,Pseudolimnophora is a genus within the tribe Limnophorini,7\n4715,LIMNOPHORINI,NEOLIMNOPHORA,Neolimnophora is a genus within the tribe Limnophorini,7\n4791,LIMNOPHORA,TATE,Tate's 1939 report on aquatic larvae is referenced,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
