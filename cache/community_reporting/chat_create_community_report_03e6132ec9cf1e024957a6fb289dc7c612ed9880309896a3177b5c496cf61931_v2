Multiple **Helina** species, such as **Helina hirtifemorata**, **Helina hengshanensis**, and **Helina obscuratoides**, are also reported, alongside **Coenosia** species like **Coenosia dilatitarsis**, **Coenosia mollicula**, **Coenosia incisurata**, and **Coenosia strigipes**.  \n\nShanxi hosts several **Phaonia** species, including **Phaonia datongensis**, **Phaonia submontana**, **Phaonia vulpinus**, **Phaonia graciloides**, **Phaonia xingxianensis**, **Phaonia wenshuiensis**, **Phaonia yanggaoensis**, **Phaonia fuscata**, **Phaonia longifurca**, **Phaonia xiangningensis**, and **Phaonia youyuensis**, with specific localities like Xingxian, Ying County, and Hanyuan noted. The province is a key distribution area for **Hydrotaea bimaculatoides** and **Hydrotaea occulta**, as well as **Hydrophoria megaloba** and other **Hydrophoria** species. Notable species include **Leucophora shanxiensis** (type locality in Taiyuan), **Leucophora personata**, **Leucophora dorsalis** (Taiyuan), **Lispe loewi**, **Paraprosalpia tibialis**, **Pseudonupedia intersecta** (Taiyuan), **Nupedia aestiva**, **Nupedia patellans**, **Nupedia infirma**, and **Haematobia**.  \n\nShanxi’s Yanbei region is highlighted for **Helina calceataeformis** and **Helina quadrum**, while Lin County is associated with **类绒粪泉蝇** (likely *Musca conducens* or a related species). The province also includes **Cuphocera varia**, **Delia longitheca**, **Egle cyrtacra** (type locality at Jinci, Taiyuan), **Fannia similis**, **Fannia scalaris**, **Muscina assimilis** (Xingxian), **Servaisia rossica**, **Sarcophaga erythrura**, **Stomorhina obsoleta**, **Xenotachina fumifemoralis**, **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, **Cynomyiomima stackelbergi**, and **Cynomya mortuorum**.

The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the specific geographic location where a species is first discovered and described, making Hanzhong a critical site for taxonomic research related to these organisms. While the descriptions provided emphasize Hanzhong's role in the context of these species, they all consistently identify it as a city within Shaanxi Province, China.
