It is recognized as a significant type locality in the field of entomology, specifically for two species of flies. The first is *亚棕翅阳蝇* (Phaonia subfusca), a species for which Taibai Mountain serves as the designated type locality, meaning it is the original and primary location where the species was first identified and described. The second is *Phaonia xianensis*, another species within the same genus, which also has Taibai Mountain as its type locality. These references highlight the mountain's ecological and scientific importance, particularly in the study of biodiversity and taxonomy of Diptera (true flies). \n\nThe descriptions provided consistently identify Taibai Mountain as situated in Shaanxi Province, with no contradictions in its geographical location. While the first and second descriptions mention distinct species, both are valid and complementary, underscoring the mountain's role as a key site for the discovery and classification of these organisms. The third description reiterates the location without adding new information, further reinforcing the consensus on its regional placement. \n\nIn summary, Taibai Mountain is a well-documented location in Shaanxi Province, China, notable for its association with the type localities of *亚棕翅阳蝇* (Phaonia subfusca) and *Phaonia xianensis*. This dual designation emphasizes its value as a reference point for entomological research and contributes to the understanding of species distribution in the region.
