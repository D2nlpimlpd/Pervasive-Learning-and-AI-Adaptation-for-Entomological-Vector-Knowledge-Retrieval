Their work spans several years, with notable publications in 1986, 1987, and 1988, often in collaboration with other entomologists such as Fan and Cui. FANG authored or co-authored descriptions of numerous *Phaonia* species, including *Phaonia lucidula*, *Phaonia insetitibia* (noted in *Acta Zoologica Sinica*), *Phaonia latimargina*, *Phaonia paucispina*, *Phaonia cercoechinata*, *Phaonia caudilata*, *Phaonia hebeta*, *Phaonia subpalpata*, *Phaonia stenoparafacia*, *Phaonia vulpinus*, *Phaonia huanglongshana*, and *Phaonia brevipalpata* (1988). Additionally, they were involved in the 1987 description of *宝兴细麻蝇* (likely *Phaonia baoxingensis* or a similar species) and co-authored *Isomyia xishuangensis*, *Isomyia pentochaeta*, and *Isomyia furcicula* in 1986 within the journal *昆虫学研究集刊*. \n\nFANG’s work on *Isomyia* includes species such as *Isomyia lingulata*, *Isomyia furcicula* (co-authored in 1986), *Isomyia viridiscutellata*, *Isomyia latimarginata*, and *Strongyloneura diploura*. For *Helina*, they co-authored the 1987 description of *Helina dibrachiata*, the 1988 description of *Helina brevipalpata*, and were associated with *Helina unistriatoides* (1988, with Cui), *Helina inflata*, *Helina squamoflava*, *Helina pleuranthus*, *Helina xizangensis*, and *Helina truncata*. Their collaborations frequently involved Fan, particularly in studies of *Isomyia* and *Strobilomyia luteoforceps* (1986), and Cui for *Helina unistriatoides*. \n\nFANG’s research is documented in key entomological journals, including *Acta Zoologica Sinica* and *昆虫学研究集刊* (likely *Entomological Research Series* or a similar publication). Their work on *Phaonia* species such as *Phaonia latimargina* and *Phaonia paucispina* further underscores their focus on taxonomic studies of flies. While some descriptions attribute sole authorship to FANG (e.g., *Phaonia lucidula* and *Isomyia viridiscutellata*), others highlight collaborative efforts, particularly with Fan and Cui. The 1986 co-authored work on *Isomyia* species and the 1987 *宽角阳蝇* (possibly *Isomyia latimarginata* or another species) align with their broader contributions to dipteran taxonomy. \n\nFANG’s publications between 1986 and 1988 reflect a concentrated effort in species discovery and classification, with a focus on morphological and taxonomic analysis. Their work on *Phaonia* and *Isomyia* species, as well as *Helina* and *Strobilomyia*, demonstrates expertise in entomology, particularly in the study of flies. The repeated co-authorship with Fan and Cui suggests a collaborative approach to research, while their individual contributions highlight their independent scholarly work. Overall, FANG’s legacy includes the formal description of over 20 species across these genera, advancing the understanding of dipteran biodiversity during the late 1980s. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",37\n4332,ISOMYIA FURCICULA,\"A species of fly described by Fang et Fan in 1986, with a body length of 7 mm, found in Taiwan (Jiayi Dabang, the type locality)\",3\n3453,MOTUO GALONGLA,\"MOTUO GALONGLA is a location in Tibet, China, serving as the type locality for Phaonia latimargina\",2\n660,HUZHONG,\"\n\nHUZHONG is a county located in the Heilongjiang Province of China. It is recognized as a significant geographical reference in biological studies, particularly for its association with two distinct species. First, HUZHONG is documented as part of the distribution range of *Acklandia subgrisea*, a plant species whose ecological presence in the region has been noted in botanical records. Second, the county serves as the type locality for *Phaonia paucispina*, a species of fly within the family Syrphidae. As the type locality, HUZHONG is the specific site where *Phaonia paucispina* was first collected and formally described by taxonomists, establishing its baseline for scientific classification. These dual roles—supporting the habitat of *Acklandia subgrisea* and anchoring the taxonomic origin of *Phaonia paucispina*—highlight HUZHONG’s importance in both plant and insect biodiversity research within Heilongjiang. The county’s inclusion in these records underscores its ecological relevance as a study area for understanding regional flora and fauna. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they pertain to separate biological contexts. HUZHONG remains a key location in scientific literature for these species.
