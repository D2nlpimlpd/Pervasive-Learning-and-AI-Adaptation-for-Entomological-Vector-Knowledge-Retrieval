Its vast territory, spanning Central Asia, the Far East, and northern territories, supported a diverse array of taxa, including flies and other arthropods. Key species and genera documented in the Soviet Union include **Macronychia striginervis** and **Macronychia polyodon**, as well as **Pseudocoenosia fletcheri**, which was found in Siberia and the Ural Mountains. The **Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia** and **Servillia ardens** were also recorded, alongside **Tachina albidopilosa** and **Tachina nupta**, which were distributed internationally within the country.  \n\nThe Soviet Union hosted multiple species of the **Helina** genus, including **Helina confinis** in the Far East and Northern/Central Europe, **Helina cothurnata**, **Helina latitarsis**, and others in regions like Siberia, Tajikistan, and the European part. **Parasarcophaga** species such as **Parasarcophaga pleskei**, **Parasarcophaga portschinskyi**, and **Parasarcophaga emdeni** were documented, as were **Phaonia** species like **Phaonia fuscata** (Far East, Western Siberia, Tajikistan, and European regions), **Phaonia hybrida**, **Phaonia malaisei**, and **Phaonia nigripennis**. The **Ph. morio**, **Ph. pallidisquama**, and **Ph. consobrina** were also present.  \n\nNotable genera and species included **Adia**, **Alashan Wohlfahrtia**, **Bercaea cruentata**, **Blaesoxipha unicolor**, **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, **Calliphora axata** (Siberia, Chita), **Drymeia vicana**, **Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi** (Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan), **Goniophyto formosensis** and **Goniophyto honshuensis**, **Hydrotaea palaestrica**, **KENT’S SARCOPHAGA** (Ussuri border), **Lispe frigida** (Siberia), **Lispe leucospila**, **Musca larvipara** (studied for its life cycle), **Musca sorbens**, **Oestrus** (Central Asia, southern Europe), **Oestromyia** (Far East, Central Asia, Siberia, Transcaucasia), **Phormia regina** (European part, Siberia, Transbaikal), **Protophormia terraenovae**, **Sinonipponia**, and **Strobilomyia laricicola** (Siberia). Specific species like **1279膨端折麻蝇**, **1280钩阳折麻蝇**, **1281毛股折麻蝇**, **1396犁头亚麻蝇**, and **1398拟对岛亚麻蝇** were also reported, alongside **古北蝗蝇** in Kazakhstan and **肖瘤胫厕蝇** in the Far East.  \n\nThe country’s ecological diversity supported rare and regionally endemic species, such as **Alloeostylus lividiventris**, **Bellardia nartshukae**, **Caricea mikii**, **Egle muscaria** (Caesar Greenbottle Fly), **Lispe odessae** (Odessa), **Lispe loewi**, **Miltogramma bimaculatum**, **Miltogramma iberium**, **Paregle aterrima** (Tajikistan), **Pegohylemyia alatavensis**, and **Stomorhina obsoleta**. Research contributions from Soviet Union scientists, such as **K.Б.

Additionally, it was a key location for the **taxonomic key for Sarcophagini** and home to the type locality for **Phormiata phormiata** in Tajikistan. Despite its dissolution, the Soviet Union remains a critical reference in global entomology for its extensive and varied insect fauna, particularly in underrepresented regions like the Ural Mountains, Kamchatka, and the Transcaucasus.  \n\nThis summary consolidates the Soviet Union’s role as a former country where over 50 insect species and genera, including **Taxigramma heteroneurum**, **Fannia kowarzi**, and **Mydaea setifemur**, were documented across its expansive and ecologically diverse territories.\",127\n2895,COENOSIA DILATITARSIS,,2\n79,LATE PROF.
