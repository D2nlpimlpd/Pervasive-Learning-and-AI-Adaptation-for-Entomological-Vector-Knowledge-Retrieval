Their research spans multiple genera and subgenera, including *Pegomya*, *Drymeia*, *Phaonia*, *Syngamoptera*, *Delia*, *Lispe*, *Hylemya*, *Craspedochoeta*, and others, with significant contributions to journals such as *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, *昆虫学研究集刊* (Insect Research Journal), and *动物学研究* (Zoological Research). FAN is credited with establishing the **Blaesoxiphini tribe** in 1965 and co-establishing the subgenus **Apicamplexa** with Qian. They described the genus *Sinochirosia* in 1982 and *Burmanomyia* in 1964, while also co-describing *Alliopsis* and *Alisarcophaga* genera. Notably, FAN introduced *Tuberomembrana* in 1981 and *Xenotachina* (as \"\"sp. n.\"\" in texts), alongside species like *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (1965) and *Dexopollenia uniseta* (1988).  \n\nFAN’s species descriptions are extensive and temporally diverse. In 1964, they described *Heteronychia quoi*. By 1965, their work included *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) shenyangensis*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) hainanensis*, *Musca pilifacies*, *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Protomiltogramma yunnanense*, *Syngamoptera gigas*, and the Chinese flat-headed fly *Catapicephala sinica*. In 1974, they described *Coelomyia ctenophora*. Collaborative efforts with colleagues like Qian, Fang, and Chen further expanded their impact, resulting in co-authored works such as *Isomyia latimarginata* and *Isomyia viridiscutellata* (1986), *Isomyia xishuangensis* and *Isomyia pentochaeta* (1986), *Nupedia henanensis*, *Enneastigma shanghaiensis*, and *Enneastigma pilosiventrosa* (with Chen), as well as *Paraprosalpia lutebasicosta* and *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae* (1983). Their 1984 publications added *Drymeia yadongensis*, *Craspedochoeta pullulula*, and *Syngamoptera unilineata*, while 1988 saw the description of *Pegohylemyia mediospicula* (拟山字泉种蝇), *Pegohylemyia qinghaisenecio* (青泽菊泉种蝇), and *Adia grisella asiatica*. Subspecies attributed to FAN include *Mesembrina montana asternopleuralis* (1965) and *Miltogramma ibericum brachygonitum* (1965).  \n\nFAN’s research also includes ecological studies, such as a 1959 paper on larval development in human feces, and contributions to domestic distribution data of Chinese fly species. They described several *Polleniopsis* species, including *Polleniopsis lata*, *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, and *Polleniopsis yunnanensis* (1988). Their legacy is marked by naming conventions like *Sinolucilia* (1965) and *Sinochirosia* (1982), as well as foundational work in dipteran taxonomy across Asia. Collaborations with Qian, Fang, and Chen yielded additional genera and species, such as *Pierretia bihami* (1981) and *Ceylonomyia taiwanensis* (1981).  \n\nIn summary, FAN’s career as a taxonomist and entomologist is defined by meticulous morphological classification, ecological insights, and extensive collaboration. Their descriptions of species like *Coelomyia ctenophora*, *Heteronychia quoi*, and *Catapicephala sinica*, along with the establishment of tribes and subgenera, have solidified their role as a pivotal figure in the study of Chinese and Asian fly fauna. Their work remains a cornerstone for dipteran taxonomy, emphasizing biodiversity and systematic research in the region.

It is recognized as a sub-tribe within the larger tribe **Protodexiini**, which itself belongs to the family Tachinidae, a group of parasitoid flies. The tribe BLAESOXIPHINI is specifically defined by its inclusion of the genus **Blaesoxipha**, which is the sole representative attributed to this taxonomic group. Fan’s original work in 1965 introduced the tribe to classify and organize species within the Protodexiini framework, emphasizing distinct morphological or ecological characteristics that differentiate Blaesoxipha from other genera in the broader tribe. While the primary description highlights its establishment and the genus it contains, the secondary context situates it hierarchically within Protodexiini, clarifying its placement in the tachinid classification system. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the authorship (Fan, 1965), the tribe’s name, and its taxonomic scope. The summary integrates these details to reflect its role as a specialized sub-group within Protodexiini, centered on the genus Blaesoxipha. This tribe is significant for its contribution to the systematic study of tachinid flies, particularly in delineating evolutionary or ecological relationships among related genera.

Males, on the other hand, possess a uniquely flower-shaped phallic membrane, a structure that may play a role in reproductive behavior or species recognition. Additionally, both sexes display well-developed lateral processes and central processes with lateral branches, which are structural adaptations potentially linked to ecological or behavioral functions. These anatomical details, particularly the combination of the red sixth tergite in females and the specialized male genitalia, are critical for classifying and distinguishing *Burmanomyia* within the broader context of fly taxonomy. The genus’s association with Myanmar highlights its regional biodiversity significance, though further studies may clarify its distribution and ecological niche.

This classification by Fan in that year formalized the taxonomic recognition of the tribe, providing a foundational framework for its study within entomology. The dual actions of establishing and describing the tribe highlight Fan's role in defining its morphological and systematic characteristics, which are critical for categorizing and understanding the evolutionary relationships of the species it encompasses. Fan's work in 1965 remains a key reference in the field, as it introduced the Blaesoxiphini tribe as a distinct taxonomic entity, enabling further research and analysis of its members.\",298\n9056,BURMANOMYIA,FAN,Burmanomyia was established by Fan in 1964,298\n9211,FAN,TSINANENSIS,Fan is the author who described Heteronychia tsinanensis in 1964,298\n1364,FAN,DELIOMYIIA,Fan established the subgenus Deliomyia in 1988,297\n2998,HYDROTAEA HSIAI,FAN,Fan is the scientific author who described Hydrotaea hsiai,297\n3361,FAN,MESAMBRIANA MERIDIANA NUDIPARAFACIA,Fan described the subspecies Mesembrina meridiana nudiparafacia in 1965,297\n3625,MUSCA CHUI,FAN,Fan described the species *Musca chui* in 1965,297\n6789,FAN,HYPOPYGIOPSIS FORTIS,Fan described the species in 1965,297\n360,华蕨蝇属 SINOCROSIA,FAN,Fan described the Sinochrosia genus,296\n631,FAN,STROBILOMYIA MELANIOLA,Fan is the describer of the species Strobilomyia melaniola,296\n1016,FAN,HYLEMIA BRUNEIPALPIS,Fan described the species Hylemya bruneipalpis in 1982,296\n2771,FAN,XENOTACHINA ZHIBENENSIS,Fan described the Xenotachina zhibenensis species,296\n2772,FAN,XENOTACHINA FUMIFEMORALIS,Fan described the Xenotachina fumifemoralis species,296\n2773,FAN,XENOTACHINA FLAVIVENTRIS,Fan described the Xenotachina flaviventris species,296\n2774,FAN,XENOTACHINA PROFEMORALIS,Fan described the Xenotachina profemoralis species,296\n2775,FAN,XENOTACHINA CHONGQINGENSIS,Fan described the Xenotachina chongqingensis species,296\n2776,FAN,XENOTACHINA PULCHELLIFRONS,Fan described the Xenotachina pulchellifrons species,296\n6650,FAN,LUCILIA HAINANENSIS,Fan is the author of the species Lucilia hainanensis,296\n6651,FAN,LUCILIA SHENYANGENSIS,Fan is the author of the species Lucilia shenyangensis,296\n6734,LUCILIA (PHAEINICIA) SHANSIENSIS,FAN,Fan described *Lucilia (Phaenicia) shansiensis*,296\n6821,FAN,HYPOPYGIOPSIS VIOLACEA,Fan described the species Hypopygiopsis violacea,296\n6976,FAN,CALLIPHORA (ABONESIA) GENARUM,Fan is the author of the species Calliphora (Abonesia) genarum,296\n7248,FAN,CHINESE COMMON FLIES MANUAL,Fan authored entries in the Chinese Common Flies Manual,296\n7452,FAN,POLLENIA RUDIS,Fan described the species Pollenia rudis in 1965,296\n9035,TUBEROMEMBRANA,FAN,Fan described the genus Tuberomembrana in 1981,296\n9275,FAN,TRICHOLOIOPROCTIA,Fan is linked to the genus *Tricholioproctia*,296\n614,LIAONING,EGLE ANTHOMYIOIDES,Egle anthomyioides is distributed in Liaoning,229\n8594,JAPAN,METOPIA AMAMIENSIS,Japan is a foreign distribution site for Metopia amamiensis,224\n1042,HYLEMIA SUPRAORBITALIS,HEILONGJIANG,\"Hylemya supraorbitalis is distributed in Heilongjiang, China\",198\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
