It is characterized by a reddish-yellow body and black abdominal tergites, distinguishing it within its taxonomic group. The species is native to China, where it has been documented in the provinces of Liaoning, Qinghai (specifically Yushu), Zhejiang, Fujian, and Yunnan. Beyond its domestic range, *Gonia klapperichi* is also found in Europe (excluding the United Kingdom) and North Africa, indicating a transcontinental distribution. \n\nEcologically, *Gonia klapperichi* plays a parasitic role in the life cycles of certain moth larvae. It specifically targets the larvae of *Agrotis segetum* (common cutworm) and *Phragmatobia fuliginosa* (a species of noctuid moth), contributing to natural pest control in its habitats. This parasitism highlights its functional significance in ecosystems where these host species are prevalent. \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in detailing the species’ taxonomy, physical traits, geographic distribution, and ecological role. No contradictions exist between the sources, allowing for a unified summary.
