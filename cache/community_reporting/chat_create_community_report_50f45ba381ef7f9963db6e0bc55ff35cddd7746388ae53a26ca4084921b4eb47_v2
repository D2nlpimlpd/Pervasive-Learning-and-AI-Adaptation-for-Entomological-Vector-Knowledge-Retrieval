He co-described the species *Drymeia tibetana* alongside Schnabl, contributing to the understanding of this fly species. Together with Schnabl, he also co-authored the description of *Phaonia latipalpis*, which was published in the journal *Nova Acta Cæsarea Leopoldino-Carolina*. In the same year, Dziedzicki and Schnabl jointly proposed the genus *Alliopsis*, establishing its taxonomic framework. Their collaboration extended to resolving taxonomic relationships, as they classified *Chionomyia* and *Paregle* as conspecific genera, effectively synonymizing them. Additionally, Dziedzicki described the species *Halina moedlingensis*, further expanding his contributions to dipteran taxonomy. He was cited in 1911 for his work on the genus *Pyrrellia*, though the specific nature of his contribution (e.g., description, classification, or analysis) is not detailed. Notably, Dziedzicki also co-described the subgenus *Pegomyza* in 1911, indicating his involvement in refining the hierarchical classification of flies. His partnership with Schnabl appears to have been central to his scientific output during this period, with multiple publications and taxonomic decisions emerging from their joint efforts. While the exact scope of his independent work remains unclear, his role as a co-author and describer highlights his expertise in morphological and systematic studies of Diptera. All these contributions were published in 1911, suggesting a concentrated period of research activity.
