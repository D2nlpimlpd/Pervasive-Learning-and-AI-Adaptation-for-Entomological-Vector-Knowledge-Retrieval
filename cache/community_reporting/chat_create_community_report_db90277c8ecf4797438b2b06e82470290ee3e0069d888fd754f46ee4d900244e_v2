Distributed in Henan, Zhejiang, and Sichuan.\",4\n3588,THOMAS,\"\n\nTHOMAS is an entomologist recognized for his contributions to the taxonomy of flies, particularly within the genus *Sarcophaga* and related species. In 1949, he described multiple species, including the type species *Sarcophaga genuforceps* and *Sarcophaga graciliforceps*, both of which are part of the *Sarcophaga* genus. Additionally, he documented *Sarcophaga subulata* as a type species, though the year for this contribution is not explicitly stated in the data. That same year, Thomas also described two species of the Pierretia fly: the \"\"1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly\"\" and the \"\"1351 Microspine Pierretia Fly,\"\" with the latter likely corresponding to the Chinese name 翼阳细麻蝇 (possibly *Sarcophaga graciliforceps*). Another species, 1395巨亚麻蝇 (a Chinese name for a fly species), was attributed to him in 1949, though its scientific nomenclature is not provided.  \n\nThomas’s work in 1949 demonstrates a focus on morphological distinctions, as evidenced by the naming of *Sarcophaga genuforceps* (type species) and *Sarcophaga graciliforceps* (type species), which may reflect variations in physical characteristics such as body structure or appendages. The data also references a 1950 specimen from Chongqing, Sichuan, associated with Thomas, though the specific species or taxonomic details of this work remain unspecified. This suggests his research extended beyond species descriptions to include fieldwork or specimen collection in China.  \n\nThe descriptions provided contain some inconsistencies in naming conventions. For instance, \"\"GENUFORCEPS SARCOPHAGA\"\" and \"\"GRACILIFORCEPS SARCOPHAGA\"\" in the fourth entry likely correspond to *Sarcophaga genuforceps* and *Sarcophaga graciliforceps*, respectively, aligning with the type species mentioned in the sixth description. The Chinese names (巨亚麻蝇, 翼阳细麻蝇) appear to be local designations for species he described, but their direct scientific equivalents are not fully clarified in the data. To resolve contradictions, it is reasonable to assume that the 1949 descriptions of *Sarcophaga genuforceps*, *Sarcophaga graciliforceps*, and *Sarcophaga subulata* are distinct type species, while the Pierretia flies and 1395巨亚麻蝇 represent additional non-type species. The 1950 Chongqing specimen likely reflects a separate contribution, possibly a new record or further study of an existing species.  \n\nIn summary, THOMAS is an entomologist who described at least three type species (*Sarcophaga genuforceps*, *Sarcophaga graciliforceps*, and *Sarcophaga subulata*) in 1949, along with two Pierretia fly species and the 1395巨亚麻蝇. His work in 1950 in Chongqing, Sichuan, adds to his legacy in documenting fly biodiversity. The use of both Chinese and Latin binomial nomenclature in the data highlights his engagement with regional taxonomic practices, though some species names require further verification for consistency. Thomas’s contributions span species discovery, type designations, and fieldwork in China, underscoring his role in advancing entomological knowledge during the mid-20th century.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",7\n5299,1395巨亚麻蝇,\"A species of fly (Parasarcophaga (Rosellea) gigas) described by Thomas in 1949, characterized by large size and found in China and North Korea\",2\n5034,SARCOPHAGA GENUFORCEPS,,1\n5300,PROC.ROY.ENT.SOC.LONDON,Journal where the 1395巨亚麻蝇 species was published,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9558,翼阳细麻蝇,JIANGSU,翼阳细麻蝇 is distributed in Jiangsu,78\n9607,GRACILIFORCEPS SARCOPHAGA,JIANGSU,GRACILIFORCEPS SARCOPHAGA is distributed in Jiangsu,75\n9599,GENUFORCEPS SARCOPHAGA,THOMAS,Thomas described the species GENUFORCEPS SARCOPHAGA in 1949,11\n10141,1395巨亚麻蝇,THOMAS,Thomas described the 1395巨亚麻蝇 species in 1949,9\n9414,THOMAS,SARCOPHAGA GENUFORCEPS,Thomas is the author of the type species Sarcophaga genuforceps,8\n10142,1395巨亚麻蝇,PROC.ROY.ENT.SOC.LONDON,The species was published in Proc.Roy.Ent.Soc.London,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
