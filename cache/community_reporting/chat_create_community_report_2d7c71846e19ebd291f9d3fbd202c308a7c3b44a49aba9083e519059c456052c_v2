It has specific morphological features like a black third abdominal segment and yellowish-brown coloration in other parts. The species is found in Liaoning, China.>\",3\n756,KAZAKHSTAN,\"\n\nKazakhstan, a landlocked country in Central Asia, is a significant region for the study of various insect species, particularly flies, due to its historical and contemporary role as a biodiversity hotspot. The country, which was part of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991, is noted as the type locality for the species *Acridomyia stacharovi*, a fly whose original description was based on specimens collected in this area during the Soviet era. Additionally, Kazakhstan is a key distribution region for the species *1279膨端折麻蝇* (likely a Chinese name for a specific fly species, possibly in the family Muscidae), indicating its presence in the country’s ecosystems. The Alashan Wohlfahrtia, a genus of flies in the family Wohlfahrtiidae, is also documented as having a foreign distribution region in Kazakhstan, highlighting the country’s ecological relevance to this group. \n\nFurther, the country is associated with the distribution of *Helina obscuratoides*, a species of fly in the family Muscidae, which was historically recorded in the Soviet Union but is now understood to inhabit present-day Kazakhstan. Similarly, the *古北蝗蝇* (a Chinese name for a species of grasshopper or fly, potentially in the family Tachinidae) is noted as being distributed in a location within the Soviet Union, which corresponds to modern-day Kazakhstan. These references underscore Kazakhstan’s importance as both a historical and current habitat for diverse insect species, particularly those with scientific or taxonomic significance. \n\nThe descriptions provided reflect a mix of historical and contemporary data, with some species explicitly tied to the Soviet Union’s geographical framework and others to modern Kazakhstan. This duality is resolved by recognizing that Kazakhstan, as a successor state to the Soviet Union, retains the ecological and geographical continuity of its former regions. The country’s vast steppes, deserts, and mountainous terrain contribute to its role as a refuge for such species, which may have limited or specialized habitats. The inclusion of both Latin and Chinese names in the descriptions suggests a focus on taxonomic research and regional biodiversity studies, emphasizing Kazakhstan’s contribution to entomological science. \n\nIn summary, Kazakhstan is a critical area for the distribution and type locality of several insect species, including *Acridomyia stacharovi*, *1279膨端折麻蝇*, *Helina obscuratoides*, and *古北蝗蝇*, as well as the Alashan Wohlfahrtia genus. Its ecological diversity and historical ties to the Soviet Union provide context for these species’ ranges, while its current status as an independent nation continues to support their habitats. This synthesis of data highlights Kazakhstan’s role in both historical and ongoing entomological research, bridging Soviet-era records with modern scientific understanding. (Word count: 250)\",4\n427,STACKELBERG,\"\n\n**STACKELBERG** is an entomologist recognized for his contributions to the taxonomy of fly species, particularly within the genus *Acridomyia*. In 1929, he described both the genus *Acridomyia* and the species *Acridomyia stacharovi*, establishing foundational classifications in this group. The same year, he also authored the description of *古北蝗蝇* (Gubei grasshopper fly), a species name that appears to correspond to a Chinese common name, which was published in the journal *Rep. Appl. Ent. (H3H)*. These works highlight his role in documenting and categorizing acridomyiine flies during the early 20th century. Additionally, Stackelberg extended his research to other taxa, as evidenced by his 1943 description of *Megacarcelia pavlovskyi*, a species within the family Tachinidae. His publications in applied entomology journals suggest a focus on species with ecological or agricultural relevance. While the descriptions of *Acridomyia stacharovi* and *古北蝗蝇* are both attributed to 1929, the latter’s inclusion of a Chinese name implies regional significance or collaboration in East Asian entomology. Stackelberg’s work spans two decades, reflecting sustained engagement with dipteran taxonomy. The consistency in the 1929 dates for the genus and species descriptions, along with the distinct 1943 entry, indicates a progression of his scientific contributions. His legacy includes formalizing the classification of multiple fly species, advancing understanding of their biodiversity and nomenclature. The journal *Rep. Appl. Ent. (H3H)*, where *古北蝗蝇* was published, underscores his involvement in applied entomological research, potentially linking his taxonomic work to practical pest management or ecological studies. Overall, Stackelberg’s efforts in 1929 and 1943 have left a notable mark on the field, particularly in the study of tachinid flies and their systematic organization.
