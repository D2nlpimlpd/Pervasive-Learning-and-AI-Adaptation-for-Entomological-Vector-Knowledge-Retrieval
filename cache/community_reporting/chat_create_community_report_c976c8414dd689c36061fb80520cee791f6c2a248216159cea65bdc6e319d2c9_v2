It serves as a critical ecological hub for multiple genera and species, including **Helina calceataeformis**, **Helina parcepilosa**, and **Sinohylemyia**, with Urumqi, Altay, and the Yili River basin highlighted as key locations. The region is home to **Metopia argyrocephala**, **Oestroderma schubini**, **Phryxe vulgaris**, and **Protophormia terraenovae**, alongside **Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata**, which is documented in domestic contexts. Notable species such as **Drymeia xinjiangensis**, **Sarcophaga variegata**, and **Parasarcophaga aegyptica** are found across its territory, with specific localities like Qume, Bole, and Kanas Lake mentioned.  \n\nXinjiang hosts a range of **Pierretia** species, including *Pierretia (s.str.) villeneuvei*, *Pierretia (s.str.) recurvata*, and *PIERRETTIA CLATHRATA*, as well as **Tachina albidopilosa** and **Tachina nupta**. The **Pegohylemyia** genus is particularly prominent, with *Pegohylemyia fugax*, *Pegohylemyia tuxeni*, *Pegohylemyia hucketti*, and *Pegohylemyia betarum* all recorded in the region. **Delia** species such as *Delia radicum*, *Delia sphaerobasis*, *Delia trispinosa*, and *Delia majuscula* are distributed in Xinjiang, alongside **Hydrophoria** species like *Hydrophoria melaena* and *Hydrophoria palaestrica* (in Manas). The **Lispe** genus, including *Lispe monochaita* and *Lispe melaleuca*, is also documented, as are **Calliphora** species like *Calliphora tianshanica* (Manshan at 2400m altitude) and *Calliphora rohdendorfi*.  \n\nThe region supports **Parasarcophaga** species such as *Parasarcophaga pleskei* and *Parasarcophaga emdeni*, as well as **Sarcophaga** species like *Sarcophaga erythrura* and *Sarcophaga semenovi*. **Muscina** species, including *Muscina assimilis*, are found in Urumqi, Altay, and other areas. **Leucophora** species like *Leucophora cinerea* and *Leucophora sociata* are present, along with **Aleximyia** and **Miltogramma**. The **Nupedia** genus (*Nupedia aestiva*, *Nupedia patellans*, *Nupedia infirma*) and **Adia** are also reported in Xinjiang.  \n\nSpecific localities within Xinjiang, such as Habahe Baihaba (black-spotted greenbottle fly), Xinyuan (Bellardia sastylata), and Hamu (East Tianshan) for *Caricea vernalis*, further illustrate its ecological diversity. The region is associated with the Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing for domestic fly studies. Additional species include **Elodia**, **Eutrichota aertica**, **Fannia incisurata**, **Fannia prisca**, **Fannia subscalaris**, **Miltogramma bimaculatum**, **Pollenia** species (*Pollenia pseudo rudis*, *Pollenia pectinata*), and **Pygophora** species (*Pygophora longicornis*, *Pygophora respondens*).  \n\nXinjiang’s fly fauna also includes **Servaisia rossica**, **Voria ruralis**, **Chirosia orthostylata**, **Brachicoma devia** (Bayi, Wensu, Zhaosu), **Blondelia nigripes**, **Cynomya mortuorum**, and **Onesiomima pamirica**. The **Brush Spring Fly** and **SHUANG YANGYING** (华美聚蜂麻蝇) are noted in specific areas like Bayi and Aksu. **Exorista fasciata** and **Exorista larvarum** are found in the region, as are **Thricops coquilletti** and **Musca domestica**.  \n\nIn summary, Xinjiang is a Chinese province and autonomous region with a rich and varied distribution of fly species and related organisms, spanning multiple genera and localities. Its ecological significance is underscored by the presence of both common and regionally unique species, supported by key locations such as Urumqi, Altay, and the Tianshan Mountains. The data collectively highlight Xinjiang as a vital area for entomological research and biodiversity conservation. (499 words)\",180\n1444,XINYUAN,\"\n\nXINYUAN is a county located in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China, recognized as a significant geographical and ecological site in entomological studies. It is associated with the distribution and habitat of several notable insect species, including *Mesembrina intermedia*, *Pollenia sytshevskajae*, *Blaesoxipha gladiatrix*, *Onesiomima pamirica*, and *Heteronychia heptapotamica*. Additionally, Xinyuan serves as the **type locality** for *Pegomya crinilamella*, meaning it is the specific location where this species was first identified and described. The region’s biodiversity is further highlighted by its role as a sublocation in Xinjiang where *Heteronychia heptapotamica* is documented. While the descriptions emphasize Xinyuan’s connection to these species, they collectively underscore its importance as a hub for studying dipteran (true fly) and other insect populations in the broader Xinjiang area. The repeated references to Xinjiang as the overarching region align with the data, and no contradictions exist in the entity’s identification as a county or its ecological associations. This synthesis integrates all provided information into a cohesive overview of Xinyuan’s entomological significance.\",4\n963,CHANGJI,\"\n\nChangji is a city located in Xinjiang province, China, and serves as a geographical reference point for the distribution and association of specific species. The city is noted for being a habitat of *Delia floricola*, a species documented as present in the region. Additionally, Changji is linked to *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, another organism associated with the area. Both entities highlight the ecological or biological significance of Changji in the context of Xinjiang's biodiversity, though the descriptions focus on distinct species. The city’s role as a location in Xinjiang is consistent across the provided data, with no direct contradictions in the information. This summary consolidates the key details from the descriptions, emphasizing Changji’s connection to these two species while maintaining clarity and coherence.\",2\n753,KANAS LAKE,\"\n\nKanas Lake is a scenic and ecologically significant body of water located in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. It is recognized as a habitat for the species *Delia penicillosa*, a fly belonging to the family Anthomyiidae, which is also known in Chinese as 黑尾缘花蝇 (translating to \"\"Black-tailed Margin Fly\"\"). The lake's unique environment in Xinjiang supports the distribution of this species, highlighting its role in regional biodiversity. As a high-altitude lake in the Tianshan Mountains, Kanas Lake is part of a protected area renowned for its pristine natural landscapes and diverse ecosystems, which likely contribute to the presence of specialized fauna such as *Delia penicillosa*. The mention of both the scientific and Chinese names in the descriptions confirms that these refer to the same species, resolving any potential ambiguity.
