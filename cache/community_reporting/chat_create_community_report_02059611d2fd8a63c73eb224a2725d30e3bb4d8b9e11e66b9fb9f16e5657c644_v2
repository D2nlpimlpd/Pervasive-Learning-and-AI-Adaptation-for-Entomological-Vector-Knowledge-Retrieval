The designation of Mount Emei as a type locality means that the mountain is the geographic reference point for the initial collection and scientific classification of these species, providing a foundational context for their identification and study. As a key location in Sichuan, Mount Emei contributes to the understanding of biodiversity and ecological dynamics in the area, particularly for taxa associated with its unique environmental conditions.

Their work spans multiple genera, including *Hydrophoria*, *Phaonia*, *Pegomya*, *Helina*, *Pegohylemyia*, *Eutrichota*, *Sarcosolomonia*, and *Iranihindia*. Li’s research career includes describing and co-describing numerous species, often in collaboration with colleagues such as Fang, Deng, Chen, and Zhang.  \n\nIn 1980, Li authored the description of *Myospila fuscicoxa* and *Pegohylemyia sichuanensis* (commonly known as the Sichuan Spring Fly). The same year also saw their work on *Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis*. By 1981, Li co-described *Hydrophoria megaloba* with Fang and Deng. In 1982, they described *Delia latissima*, and in 1985, they co-described *Iranihindia spinosa* and *范氏细麻蝇* (Fang’s fine flesh fly). In 1987, Li authored the description of *Helina dibrachiata* and co-described *宽角阳蝇* (Broad-angled Yang fly) with collaborators.  \n\nLi’s extensive work on the genus *Pegomya* includes describing multiple species: *Pegomya folifera*, *Pegomya tenuiramula*, *Pegomya hamatacrophalla*, *Pegomya angusticerca*, *Pegomya simpliciforceps*, *Pegomya flaviprecoxa*, *Pegomya nudapicalis*, and *Pegomya melatrochanter*. These contributions highlight their focus on Pegomya’s morphological diversity and ecological roles.  \n\nCollaborative efforts are a hallmark of Li’s career. They co-described *Phaonia subemarginata* (1981) with Fang and Deng, *Polleniopsis yunnanensis* (1988) with Chen and Zhang, and *Eutrichota bilobella* (1985) with Deng. Additionally, Li co-authored the description of *Phaonia lamellata*, *Phaonia subpalpata*, *Phaonia stenoparafacia*, and *Phaonia lucidula*, as well as *Phorbia hypandrium* with Deng. In 1985, they also co-described *Sarcosolomonia hongheensis*, a newly identified species.  \n\nNotably, Li is credited with the description of *曲股欧麻蝇* (Curved-thighed European flesh fly), though the specific year is not provided in the data. Their work on *Phaonia mimoaureola* further underscores their expertise in the *Phaonia* genus.  \n\nLi’s research, spanning over three decades, has advanced the understanding of fly taxonomy in China and beyond. Their publications, often in collaboration with other entomologists, reflect a dedication to documenting biodiversity and refining classification systems. The combination of solo and joint efforts, along with the breadth of species described, positions Li as a pivotal figure in the study of Diptera, particularly in the context of Chinese fauna.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",30\n969,INSECT RESEARCH,昆虫学研究 is a publication referencing Delia latissima,4\n2618,ANIMAL分类学报,Chinese journal where Myospila fuscicoxa was described,2\n1439,PEGOMYA NUDAPICALIS,\"Pegomya nudapicalis is a subspecies of Pegomya dichaetomyiola described by Li et Deng in 1988, published in Chinese Journal of Economic Entomology, with type locality at E'Mei Mountain, Sichuan\",4\n1442,CHINESE JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,\"\n\nThe *Chinese Journal of Economic Entomology* is a scholarly publication focused on entomological research, particularly in the context of economic and agricultural significance. It has served as a platform for the formal description of several species within the genus *Pegomya*, a group of flies often associated with plant-feeding behaviors and ecological studies. Among the species documented in the journal are *Pegomya nudapicalis*, *Pegomya crinilamella*, and *Pegomya aurivillosa*. Notably, the journal also published the description of *Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis*, which appears to be a subspecies or variant of *Pegomya nudapicalis*, as indicated by the inclusion of \"\"dichaetomyiola\"\" in its full scientific name. This suggests that the journal has contributed to both species-level and subspecies-level taxonomic work within the *Pegomya* genus. The descriptions of these species, likely detailed in peer-reviewed articles, provide insights into their morphology, taxonomy, and potential ecological or agricultural impacts. The journal’s role in publishing such studies highlights its importance in advancing understanding of economically relevant insect species, particularly those with implications for pest management or biodiversity research. By consolidating these findings, the *Chinese Journal of Economic Entomology* supports scientific collaboration and knowledge dissemination in the field of entomology, emphasizing its value as a resource for researchers and practitioners. The inclusion of multiple *Pegomya* species in its publications underscores the journal’s focus on documenting and analyzing insect diversity, especially in regions where these species may interact with crops or natural ecosystems. While the first description specifically references *Pegomya nudapicalis*, the second expands the scope to include three additional species, indicating the journal’s broader contributions to the classification of *Pegomya* taxa. The apparent discrepancy in naming (*Pegomya nudapicalis* vs. *Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis*) is resolved by recognizing the latter as a more precise taxonomic designation, likely reflecting updated nomenclature or a subspecies classification. Overall, the *Chinese Journal of Economic Entomology* plays a critical role in entomological science, offering a venue for detailed taxonomic work and fostering research on insects with economic relevance. Its publications on *Pegomya* species exemplify its commitment to advancing knowledge in this specialized area.
