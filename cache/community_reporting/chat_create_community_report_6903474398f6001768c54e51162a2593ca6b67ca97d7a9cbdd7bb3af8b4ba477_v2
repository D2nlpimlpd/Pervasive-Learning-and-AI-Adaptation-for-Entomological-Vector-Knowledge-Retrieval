They co-described the species *Delia pectinitibia* with Fan in 1981, as noted in multiple sources, and are also credited as the sole author for describing *Delia pansihirtae*. In 1990, JIN collaborated with Fan and Wu to describe *Drymeia pectinitibia*, further expanding their work on related species. Additionally, they authored the description of *Drymeia plumisaeta* in 1988, demonstrating their involvement in the classification of multiple *Drymeia* species over time. JIN’s research is frequently cited in entomological publications, where they are highlighted as a co-author for *Drymeia* species descriptions, underscoring their role in advancing the understanding of this group. Beyond these genera, JIN contributed to the study of *Eutrichota*, serving as an author of a 1983 paper published in the journal *昆虫分类学报* (Entomological Journal of China). Their work spans collaborative efforts with peers such as Fan, Wu, and others, reflecting a pattern of teamwork in taxonomic research. The descriptions of *Delia pectinitibia* appear in two contexts: one as a co-author with Fan in 1981 and another as part of a 1990 collaboration with Fan and Wu, which may refer to distinct species or a revised classification. Overall, JIN’s career is marked by significant taxonomic contributions to dipteran insects, with a focus on detailed species descriptions and interdisciplinary collaboration. Their publications, including the 1983 *Eutrichota* study, highlight their expertise in systematic entomology and their engagement with both Chinese and international scientific communities. The data collectively establish JIN as a key figure in the classification of flies, with a particular emphasis on the genera *Delia* and *Drymeia* during the 1980s and 1990s.\",7\n1386,ALLIOPSIS HETEROCHAETOIDES,\"A species of fly described by Jin and Fan in 1983, characterized by a fifth abdominal segment with a wide base, no bristles on the outer surface, and a body length of 4.5 mm.

As a type locality, it serves as the geographic reference point for the original description and classification of these species, making it a significant site in taxonomic and biological research. The area is notable for its role in documenting biodiversity, particularly in entomology or botany, depending on the species' classification. While the descriptions do not specify the exact nature of *Eutrichota* (likely a genus of insects or plants) or *Alliopsis heterochaetoides* (a species name, possibly a plant or invertebrate), their shared designation of YUZHONG as a type locality underscores the region’s ecological or scientific relevance. Gansu Province, known for its diverse ecosystems ranging from arid deserts to mountainous habitats, may provide the environmental conditions necessary for these species to thrive. The dual association of YUZHONG with both species suggests it is a focal point for studies in its respective field, though further details about the species’ characteristics or the specific research conducted there are not included in the provided data. The lack of contradictions in the descriptions allows for a unified summary, emphasizing YUZHONG’s importance as a foundational site for taxonomic work. Its designation as a type locality for both entities highlights its role in anchoring scientific nomenclature and facilitating comparative studies. Researchers and taxonomists likely reference YUZHONG to validate the original habitats and traits of these species, ensuring accuracy in their classification and subsequent ecological or evolutionary analyses. The location’s significance is further reinforced by its connection to two distinct species, indicating potential for broader biodiversity studies in the region. Overall, YUZHONG stands as a critical geographic marker in the scientific community, particularly for the disciplines that study *Eutrichota* and *Alliopsis heterochaetoides*.

It was first described by the entomologist Johann Wilhelm von Loew in 1873, establishing its foundational role in the taxonomic classification of the *Eutrichota* group. As a member of the genus *Eutrichota*, this species is part of the family Tachinidae, a group of parasitoid flies known for their ecological significance in regulating insect populations. The species is specifically noted for its presence in China, where it has been documented as part of the region’s diverse fly fauna. While the genus *Eutrichota* may include other species, *Eutrichota inornata* holds particular importance as the type species, providing a reference point for identifying and categorizing related taxa. Its description by Loew in 1873 marks a key historical contribution to the study of tachinid flies, and its geographic association with China highlights its role in the biodiversity of that area. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the species’ taxonomic placement, its status as the type species of *Eutrichota*, and its connection to China.
