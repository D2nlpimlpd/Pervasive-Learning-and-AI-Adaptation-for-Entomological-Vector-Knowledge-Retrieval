Its vast territory, spanning Central Asia, the Far East, and parts of Eastern Europe, supported a diverse array of taxa, many of which are now documented in post-Soviet states. Key species and genera associated with the Soviet Union include:  \n\n- **Macronychia striginervis** and **Macronychia polyodon**, which were native to the region.  \n- **Pseudocoenosia fletcheri**, found in Siberia and the Ural Mountains.  \n- **Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia**, distributed across the Soviet Union’s European part, Turkestan, Siberia, the Ussuri border, and Sakhalin Island.  \n- **Senotainia deserta**, **Apodacra**, and **Miltogrammoides**, with records in Krasnovodsk and Chiva (modern-day Turkmenistan).  \n- **Helina** species, including **Helina confinis** (Far East, Northern and Central Europe), **Helina cothurnata**, **Helina latitarsis**, **Helina obscuratoides**, **Helina lasiophthalma**, and **Helina punctifemoralis**, spread across Siberia, Tajikistan, and the European part.  \n- **Parasarcophaga** species such as **Parasarcophaga pleskei**, **Parasarcophaga portschinskyi**, and **Parasarcophaga emdeni**, as well as **Phaonia** species like **Phaonia fuscata** (Far East, Western Siberia, Tajikistan, and northern/central Europe), **Phaonia pallidisquama**, **Phaonia consobrina**, **Phaonia luteovittata**, and **Phaonia hybrida**.  \n- **Strobilomyia** species, including **Strobilomyia laricicola**, documented in Siberia and the Baikal Lake region.  \n- **Oestromyia** and **Oestrus** genera, with **Oestrus** species present in Central Asia and southern Europe.  \n- **Taxigramma heteroneurum**, **Phrosinella nasuta**, **Phylloteles pictipennis**, **Goniophyto formosensis**, **Goniophyto honshuensis**, and **Wohlfahrtia stackelbergi**, all linked to the Soviet Union’s Far East, Central Asia, or Transcaucasia.  \n- **Musca larvipara**, a species whose life cycle was studied in the Soviet Union, alongside **Musca sorbens** and **Musca crassirostris** (southern Turkmen regions).  \n- **Phormia regina**, found in the European part, Siberia, and Transbaikal.  \n- **Tachina albidopilosa** and **Tachina nupta**, as well as **Servillia ardens**, with international distribution records in the Soviet Union.  \n- **Lispe** species like **Lispe frigida** (Siberia), **Lispe odessae** (Odessa), and **Lispe leucospila**.  \n- **Scathophaga suilla** and **Scathophaga mellipes**, documented in the Far East and Central Asia.  \n- **Pollenomyia sinensis** and **Pollenomyia okazakii** in the Far East Primorsky Krai.  \n- **Alashan Wohlfahrtia**, **Blaesoxipha unicolor**, **Blaesoxipha arenicola**, and **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, with Central Asian and Transcaucasian records.  \n- **K.Б.
