In 1939, Mesnil first described the genus *Aplomyiella*. By 1944, they contributed to the field by authoring the species *Sisyropa soror* and *Drino lugens*. In 1946, Mesnil described three additional species: *Prosalia*, *Phorcidella*, and *Exorista auriceps*. Their work in 1952 included the species *Pexopsis capitata*, while 1956 marked the description of *Gonia klapperichi*. In 1960, Mesnil authored two species, *Siphona boreata* and *Chaetexorista klapperichi*, and also described *Dolichocolon klapperichi* (the year for this latter species is unspecified in the data). Further contributions in 1967 included the species *Hyalurgus spathulatus*. Finally, in 1972, Mesnil described the genera *Hesionella* and *Albiniola*.
