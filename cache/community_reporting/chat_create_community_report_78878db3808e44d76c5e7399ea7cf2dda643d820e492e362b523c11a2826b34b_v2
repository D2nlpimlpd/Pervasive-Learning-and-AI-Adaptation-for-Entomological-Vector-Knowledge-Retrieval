The survey, carried out in 1964, focused on identifying and analyzing the environmental conditions associated with fly larvae development, particularly in relation to public health and disease prevention. It also included a detailed examination of five *Fannia* species: *Fannia incisurata*, *Fannia leucosticta*, *Fannia scalaris*, *Fannia canicularis*, and *Fannia prisca Stein*. These species were likely selected due to their potential roles in disease transmission or ecological significance, as part of the station’s broader efforts to monitor and control vector populations. The study aimed to map their habitats, assess population dynamics, and inform strategies for mitigating health risks linked to fly infestations. The survey was organized and executed by the **Jinzhou Health and Epidemic Prevention Station**, which is consistently referenced across all descriptions as the responsible entity. While the descriptions emphasize different aspects—larval habitats in one and the specific *Fannia* species in another—their alignment in time, location, and institutional involvement confirms they pertain to the same initiative. The findings would have contributed to understanding local fly ecology, guiding sanitation measures, and supporting epidemic prevention efforts in Jinzhou during the mid-20th century. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all elements cohesively describe a single, multi-faceted survey targeting both larval habitats and the distribution of *Fannia* species.

In 1964, the Jinzhou Health and Epidemic Prevention Station (also referred to as the Jinzhou City Health and Epidemic Prevention Station) conducted a comprehensive survey on fly larvae, focusing on their habitats and population dynamics. This research aimed to understand the ecological distribution and behavior of fly species in the region, with particular attention to *Acrostilpna aculeata*, a species documented as being present in Jinzhou. The studies highlighted the city’s role in broader efforts to monitor and manage insect populations, likely for public health or agricultural purposes. While the descriptions emphasize different aspects of the 1964 investigations—such as larvae habitats, fly populations, and the involvement of the health station—they collectively underscore Jinzhou’s significance as a site for entomological research during that period. The city’s inclusion in these studies reflects its geographical and environmental relevance to the distribution of specific fly species in Liaoning.

This survey was part of the station’s broader public health and disease prevention efforts, targeting the ecological conditions that support the development of fly larvae, a critical factor in understanding and mitigating vector-borne disease transmission. The 1964 survey in Jinzhou aimed to identify and analyze the environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and organic matter availability, that influence the proliferation of fly larvae in the region. By mapping these habitats, the station sought to inform strategies for controlling fly populations, which are often linked to the spread of pathogens like bacteria and viruses through contaminated surfaces or food. The initiative underscored the station’s role in addressing local health challenges through scientific research and data-driven interventions. The survey’s findings likely contributed to targeted sanitation measures, waste management practices, or public education campaigns to reduce fly breeding sites and associated health risks.
