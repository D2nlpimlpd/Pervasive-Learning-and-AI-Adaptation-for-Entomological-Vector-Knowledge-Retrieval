It has been associated with multiple taxonomic contributions, including the formal description of *Polleniopsis lata*, *Hydrotaea bimaculatoides*, *Lispe hirsutipes* in 1981, and *Idiella tripartita* in a 1982 study conducted by Chen Zhizi. These entries highlight the journal’s role in advancing knowledge of insect biodiversity, morphology, and ecological interactions.  \n\nThe journal has documented the discovery of *Polleniopsis lata*, a species likely belonging to the Diptera order (flies), and *Hydrotaea bimaculatoides*, a member of the Sarcophagidae family (flesh flies). Additionally, it published the 1981 description of *Lispe hirsutipes*, a fly species in the Syrphidae family (hoverflies), and featured Chen Zhizi’s 1982 research on *Idiella tripartita*, which may pertain to its taxonomy, life cycle, or ecological significance. These studies underscore the journal’s focus on both morphological and applied entomological research, contributing to the understanding of insect classification and their roles in ecosystems.  \n\nWhile the specific scope of the *Insect Research Collection* is not detailed in the provided descriptions, its association with these species and studies suggests it is a specialized academic resource for entomologists. The journal appears to have a long-standing history, with records dating back to at least 1981, and has been utilized to publish findings on diverse insect groups, including flies and hoverflies. The inclusion of both species descriptions and ecological studies indicates a multidisciplinary approach, bridging taxonomy with broader biological and environmental research.  \n\nThe entity’s name, *Insect Research Collection*, may refer to a journal, a curated database, or a repository of entomological findings, though the descriptions provided emphasize its function as a publication medium. The journal’s contributions to the field include not only the formal naming of species but also the dissemination of research that supports conservation, pest management, and evolutionary studies. By compiling works such as Chen Zhizi’s 1982 study and the 1981 documentation of *Lispe hirsutipes*, the *Insect Research Collection* plays a critical role in preserving scientific records and fostering collaboration among researchers.  \n\nIn summary, the *Insect Research Collection* is a publication that has documented the description of several insect species, including *Polleniopsis lata*, *Hydrotaea bimaculatoides*, *Lispe hirsutipes* (1981), and *Idiella tripartita* (1982), while also hosting ecological and taxonomic studies. Its historical activity since the early 1980s reflects its importance in entomological science, serving as a repository for both foundational and applied research on insect diversity and biology. The journal’s focus on detailed species documentation and its role in publishing studies by researchers like Chen Zhizi position it as a valuable resource for the entomological community.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",3\n87,CHEN ZHIZI,\"\n\n**CHEN ZHIZI** is a researcher associated with significant contributions to entomological studies. They authored a 1982 study on *Idiella tripartita*, a species within the Insect Research Collection, demonstrating their expertise in insect taxonomy or related fields. Additionally, Chen Zhizi contributed to a book while affiliated with the **Shanghai Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences**, a leading institution in China for entomological research. This affiliation highlights their academic and professional engagement with scientific documentation and analysis of insect species. The combination of their 1982 study and book contribution underscores their role in advancing knowledge about *Idiella tripartita* and broader entomological research. Both works are linked to their time at the Shanghai Institute of Entomology, suggesting a focus on systematic studies or ecological research of insects. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as they align in attributing these contributions to Chen Zhizi’s career. Their work remains part of the Insect Research Collection, indicating its value to ongoing scientific inquiry.
