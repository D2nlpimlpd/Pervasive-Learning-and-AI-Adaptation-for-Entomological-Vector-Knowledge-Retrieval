It has served as a platform for describing and documenting numerous species across various genera, including *Limnophora*, *Syngamoptera*, *Helina*, *Bellardia*, *Polleniopsis*, and *Phaonia*. The journal has published descriptions of *Limnophora cyclocerca* and *Limnophora guizhouensis*, as well as *Syngamoptera gigas*, *Syngamoptera chekiangensis*, and *Syngamoptera angustifrons*. Additionally, it has featured the publication of *Helina hengshanensis* and *Helina xiaowutaiensis*, *Bellardia oligochaeta* and *Bellardia curviloba*, and *Polleniopsis yunnanensis* (Chen et al., 1988). Among its notable contributions are the 1985 description of *Phaonia vagata* and the documentation of *Phaonia guangdongensis*. These publications highlight the journal’s role in advancing knowledge of dipteran taxonomy, with a focus on species from China and their ecological or morphological characteristics. While some entries specify publication years (e.g., 1985 and 1988), others do not, suggesting a broader historical scope of contributions. The journal’s multilingual presence, including its Chinese title, underscores its significance in both international and domestic scientific communities. By consolidating these species descriptions, ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH provides a critical resource for researchers studying insect diversity and systematics.\",27\n2886,JIXI,\"Location in Inner Mongolia, China, for Coenosia dilatitarsis\",2\n3338,JIRISAN,,2\n3175,\"FANG, LI ET DENG\",\"Fang, Li et Deng are the authors of the species Helina dibrachiata\",1\n3336,HULIN,,1\n3337,JINGPO LAKE,,1\n3339,CENTRAL EUROPEAN PART OF SOVIET UNION,,1\n3340,ZACHERNYA,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2714,ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH,SYNGAMOPTERA GIGAS,Syngamoptera gigas was described in the journal Zoological Research,30\n6015,ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH,JIXI,\"The journal's described species is found in Jixi, Heilongjiang\",29\n6020,ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH,JIRISAN,\"The journal's described species is found in Jirisan, Korea\",29\n5713,\"FANG, LI ET DENG\",ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH,\"Fang, Li et Deng published Helina dibrachiata in Zoological Research\",28\n6016,ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH,HULIN,\"The journal's described species is found in Hulin, Heilongjiang\",28\n6017,ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH,JINGPO LAKE,\"The journal's described species is found in Jingpo Lake, Heilongjiang\",28\n6023,ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH,CENTRAL EUROPEAN PART OF SOVIET UNION,The journal's described species is found in the Central European part of the Soviet Union,28\n6024,ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH,ZACHERNYA,\"The journal's described species is found in Zachernya, Soviet Union\",28\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
