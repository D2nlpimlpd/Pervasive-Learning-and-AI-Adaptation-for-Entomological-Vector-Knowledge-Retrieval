The Hengduan Mountains, a mountain range in southwestern China spanning Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces, host a rich array of insect species, many of which are endemic or understudied. Two notable studies have contributed to the documentation of this fauna. The first, published in a journal, describes two species of the genus *Phaonia*—*Phaonia mimobasiseta* and *Phaonia caudilata*—in volume 2, page 1237. These species, likely blowflies (family Calliphoridae), are part of the broader research into the region's dipteran diversity, which plays critical roles in ecosystems as decomposers, pollinators, and food sources. The second study focuses on *Drymeia* species, a genus within the family Muscidae, and documents their presence in the same provinces (Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai). This publication highlights the taxonomic and ecological significance of *Drymeia* in the Hengduan Mountains, emphasizing the area's role as a hotspot for muscid fly diversity. Together, these works underscore the importance of the Hengduan Mountains as a key region for entomological research, where both *Phaonia* and *Drymeia* species contribute to the understanding of local insect communities. The studies also reflect the fragmented yet growing body of knowledge about the area's insects, with each publication addressing distinct genera and geographic subsets. While the first study provides specific taxonomic details for *Phaonia* species, the second expands the scope to *Drymeia*, illustrating the range of dipteran adaptations in the region's varied habitats. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they reference separate species and publications. Collectively, they reinforce the Hengduan Mountains' status as a vital area for conserving and studying insect biodiversity, with ongoing research continuing to uncover new species and ecological relationships. These findings are essential for informing conservation strategies and understanding the impacts of environmental changes on fragile alpine and subtropical ecosystems.\",5\n704,YUNNAN,\"\n\nYunnan, a Chinese province (云南) renowned for its rich biodiversity, is a key region for the distribution of numerous fly species and genera. The province hosts documented populations of **Mesembrina** species, as well as **Argyrophylax laticornis**, **Atherigona reversura**, **Atherigona oryzae**, and **Atherigona yiwulushan**. It is also home to **Iranihindia spinosa**, **Metopia auripulvera**, **Musca convexifrons** (found in Kunming and Xishuangbanna), **Musca malaisei**, **Musca craggi**, **Musca seniorwhitei**, **Phryxe vulgaris**, and **Pogonomyia** species in areas like Deqin and Weixi. Specific localities such as Lijiang Dayanzhen serve as the type locality for **FAN'S SARCOPHAGA**, while **Kanomyia bangkokensis** and **Meliniella spatuliforceps** (type locality in Ruili Mengxiu) are also recorded there.  \n\nYunnan’s diverse ecosystems support multiple **Isomyia** species, including **I. divisa**, **I. mandarina**, and **I. tripartita**, as well as **Servillia planiforceps** and **Periscepsia carbonaria**. The province is notable for its **Chrysomya** species, such as **Chrysomya pinguis**, **Chrysomya megacephala**, and **Chrysomya bezziana**, distributed across cities like Lufeng, Shiping, Dali, Kunming, and Xishuangbanna. **Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis** and **Sarcorohdendorfia seniorwhitei** are also present, with the latter’s type locality in Yongshan.  \n\nAdditional species documented in Yunnan include **Calliphora axata** (Zhongxun), **Calliphora rohdendorfi**, **Calliphora chinghaiensis** (Zhongdian), **Graphomya rufitibia** (Xishuangbanna), **Paradichosia scutellata**, **Polietes orientalis** (Deqin), **Sturmiopsis inferens**, **Syngamoptera jirisanensis**, and **Xenotachina pulchellifrons**. The province is a domestic distribution site for **Adia**, **Metoposisyrops scirpophagae**, **Muscina** (specifically in Kunming), **Vibrissina Rondani**, **Haematobia**, **Neomyia** species (Mengding, Gengma, Dushu Jiao, Mengla), and **Sarcosolomonia** species.  \n\nYunnan’s southern regions, such as the Nujiang River Valley, are associated with **Metopia suifenhoensis** and **Metopia yunnanica**, while **Drymeia midtibia** and **Drymeia grapsopoda** are found in the province. The genus **Periscepsia** is present in Yunnan, alongside **Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri** (Xishuangbanna) and **Bercaea cruentata**. **Bellardia curviloba**, **Bellardia micromenechma**, and **Bellardia notomenechma** are documented in Kunming and other areas.  \n\nNotable localities within Yunnan include **Lugu Hu** (Kunming) for **Bellardia** species, **Jianshui** for **Brontaea hirtifemorata** (Jizushan in Bichuan), and **Lancang** and **Xishuangbanna** for **Achoetandrus rufifacies**. The province is also home to **Kangding Variant Beauty Fly Paradichosia kangdingensis**, **Xanthotryxus uniapicalis**, **Delia bracata**, **Drino facialis**, and **Phaonia dianierrans** (type locality).  \n\nYunnan’s ecological significance is further underscored by its role as a domestic distribution site for **Carcelia matsukarehae**, **Carcelia ambigua**, **Carcelia kockiana** (hosting *Heliothis armigera*), **Parasarcophaga brevicornis**, **Parasarcophaga macroauriculata**, and **Gymnadichosia pusilla**. The Dehong Sugarcane Experiment Station in Yunnan has been pivotal in studying the host species of **Sturmiopsis inferens**.  \n\nWith sublocations like **Xishuangbanna**, **Deqin**, **Weixi**, **Lushui**, **Luku**, **Ruili**, and **Jingdong**, Yunnan’s fly fauna includes rare and regionally endemic species such as **Onesia sinensis**, **Onesia wolongensis**, **611扁蹠芒蝇**, **612黄髭芒蝇**, and **蓝黑栉寄蝇Pales pavida**. The province’s status as a biodiversity hotspot is reinforced by its inclusion in studies by the **Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing** and its role in documenting species like **Eudasyphora cyanicolor**, **Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) jacobsoni**, and **Miltogramma bimaculatum**.  \n\nThis summary consolidates Yunnan’s extensive fly species records, emphasizing its ecological and taxonomic importance in China.
