CHEN's work spans multiple genera, including *Dinemomyia*, *Bellardia*, *Polleniopsis*, *Enneastigma*, *Paradichosia*, and *Alliopsis*, with collaborations involving researchers such as Fan, Yao, and others. In 1975, CHEN established the genus *Dinemomyia* and described its type species, *Dinemomyia nigribasicosta*. Earlier, in 1979, CHEN authored *Bellardia menechmoides* and *Onesia variola*, and by 1983, expanded the *Bellardia* genus by describing *Bellardia xinganensis* as well as additional species like Qinghai *Bellardia*, Fengcheng *Bellardia*, Chosen *Bellardia*, and Menechmoides *Bellardia*. \n\nCHEN's collaborations with Fan are notable, particularly in the 1980s. Together, they described *Enneastigma shanghaiensis* and *Enneastigma pilosiventrosa*, as well as *E. labradorensis* in 1980. In 1980, CHEN and Fan also co-authored the description of *曲叶近脉花蝇* (a species name in Chinese, likely *Pierretia recurvata*). By 1982, CHEN contributed to the description of *Delia gracilibacilla* and the 1337耳阳细麻蝇 species. In 1983, CHEN and Fan co-authored *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae* and *Paraprosalpia conifrons changbaiensis*, and CHEN independently described *Delia jilinensis*. The same year, CHEN co-established the genus *Alliopsis* with Fan. \n\nCHEN's work on the *Polleniopsis* genus is extensive, including the 1988 description of *Polleniopsis yunnanensis* and *Polleniopsis varilata*, as well as *Polleniopsis deqingensis* and *Polleniopsis milina*. In 1991, CHEN co-authored *Polleniopsis cuonaensis*. Additionally, CHEN co-described *Pegomya aurivillosa* in 1984 and *Pierretia (s.str.) recurvata* in 1986 with Yao. In 1990, CHEN collaborated on the description of *Limnophora brunneisquama*. \n\nBeyond species-level work, CHEN is associated with the subgenus *Hamimembrana* and broader taxonomic classifications. CHEN also co-authored the 1981 description of the genus *Alisarcophaga*. Notably, CHEN's contributions to *Paradichosia* include co-describing *blaesostyla*, *brachyphalla*, and *kangdingensis*. The researcher's work with Fan further extended to *Monochrotogaster rufifrons* in 1982 and *Engyneura curvostylata* in 1980. \n\nCHEN's career reflects a focus on dipteran taxonomy, with a particular emphasis on genera such as *Dinemomyia*, *Bellardia*, and *Polleniopsis*. Collaborations with Fan and Yao highlight partnerships in advancing the understanding of these groups, while independent work on species like *Delia gracilibacilla* and *Onesia variola* underscores CHEN's individual expertise. The descriptions of both Chinese and internationally recognized species, along with the establishment of new genera, demonstrate CHEN's role in expanding entomological knowledge across diverse regions and taxonomic levels. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",52\n3896,POLLINIOPSIS DEQINGENSIS,\"Insect species described by Chen and Fan in 1992, found in Yunnan (Deqin)\",3\n3888,POLLENIOPSIS DEQINGENSIS,\"A species of mimic fruit fly described by Chen and Fan in 1992, published in Journal of Insect Taxonomy.
