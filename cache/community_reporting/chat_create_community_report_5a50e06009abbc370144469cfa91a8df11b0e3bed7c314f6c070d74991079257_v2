It is recognized as the type locality for the species *Dichaetomyia flavipalpis*, a key reference point in entomological studies. The region is home to multiple fly species, including *松毛虫缅麻蝇* (a species of *Dichaetomyia*) and *盘突缅麻蝇*, both of which are documented in its ecological records. Additionally, species such as *Lucilia sinensis* and *Lucilia shenyangensis* (blowflies) are distributed across the province, contributing to its diverse fauna.  \n\nFurther, *Sinonipponia hainanensis* is reported to inhabit Taiwan, as are several *Helina* species, including *Helina lateralis*, *Helina nemorum*, and *Helina sexmaculata*, which are noted for their domestic presence. The region also supports the distribution of *Tricycleopsis paradoxa*, a fly species with specific ecological adaptations. Notably, *污瓣莫蝇* and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* are recorded in Taiwan, with specific localities such as Fengshan and Tainan identified as their habitats.  \n\nOther species associated with Taiwan include *知本客夜蝇*, a nocturnal fly, and *叉丽蝇*, which is part of the broader distribution range for this genus in China. The province’s insect diversity extends to *侧线孟蝇* and *浙江孟蝇*, both of which are documented in the area. Sub-regions like Anping and Kaohsiung are highlighted as distinct locations within Taiwan where these species are observed.  \n\nIn summary, Taiwan, China, is a critical ecological zone for numerous fly species, including both common and regionally specific taxa. Its role as a type locality for *Dichaetomyia flavipalpis* and the presence of genera such as *Lucilia*, *Helina*, *Pyrellia*, and *Tricycleopsis* underscore its importance in entomological research. The inclusion of sub-locations like Fengshan, Tainan, Anping, and Kaohsiung further emphasizes the localized biodiversity within the region. This comprehensive overview reflects the interconnectedness of Taiwan’s ecosystems and their contribution to the broader understanding of insect distribution in China.
