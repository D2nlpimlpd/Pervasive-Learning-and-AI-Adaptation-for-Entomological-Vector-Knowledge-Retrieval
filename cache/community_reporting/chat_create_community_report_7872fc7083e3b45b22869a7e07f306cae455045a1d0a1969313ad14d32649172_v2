He is best known for his contributions to the study of fly species, particularly in the mid-20th century. In 1957, Fan Zide authored multiple significant works, including a study on fly species published in the *Acta Entomologica Sinica* and a separate article in the *Journal of Entomology*. His 1957 research also specifically focused on the species *Calliphora vomitoria*, a blowfly commonly associated with forensic and ecological studies. Additionally, he conducted a 1959 report on *Fannia* species in Shanghai, further expanding his expertise in regional fly taxonomy and ecology.  \n\nBeyond his early research, Fan Zide played a pivotal role in advancing entomological knowledge in China through editorial and leadership positions. He served as the editor-in-chief of the second edition of the authoritative monograph *\"\"Key to the Common Flies of China,\"\"* published in 1992. This work, for which he was the primary author, became a foundational resource for identifying and classifying fly species in the region. His affiliation with the East China Institute of Entomology and his role as head of the Shanghai Institute of Entomology underscored his leadership in the field. These institutions, both based in Shanghai, were central to his research and editorial endeavors, reflecting his deep connection to the city’s scientific community.  \n\nFan Zide’s career highlights his dual focus on empirical research and knowledge dissemination. His 1957 studies in *Acta Entomologica Sinica* and the *Journal of Entomology* established him as a key figure in fly taxonomy, while his 1959 report on *Fannia* species demonstrated his commitment to regional entomological analysis. The 1992 edition of the *\"\"Key to the Common Flies of China\"\"* solidified his legacy as a leading authority, combining his research with collaborative efforts to standardize classification methods. His work at the East China Institute of Entomology and Shanghai Institute of Entomology further positioned him as a central figure in Chinese entomology, bridging academic research and practical applications.  \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in identifying Fan Zide as a prolific author, editor, and institutional leader in entomology. While some details overlap (e.g., the 1957 studies in different journals), they collectively emphasize his expertise in fly species and his role in advancing entomological science in China. His contributions spanned both foundational research and the curation of critical taxonomic resources, ensuring his influence endured across generations of scientists. Fan Zide’s career remains a cornerstone in the study of Chinese flies, with his publications and editorial work continuing to reference his meticulous approach to classification and regional biodiversity.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",11\n75,ZHONG JIANPING,Spouse of Fan Zide who provided extensive support for the book's revision and completion,1\n110,CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES EAST CHINA INSTITUTE OF ENTOMOLOGY,\"The East China Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, where the book was completed and where Fan Zide is affiliated\",1\n6148,1957 ENTOMOLOGY JOURNAL ARTICLE,Article published in the Entomology Journal in 1957,1\n6153,1957 STUDY IN ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,Research on fly species by Fan Zide published in Acta Entomologica Sinica,1\n6196,PUBLICATION BY FAN ZIDE IN 1957,Fan Zide's 1957 publication in *Acta Entomologica Sinica* on *Calliphora vomitoria*,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11883,JINZHOU CITY HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,1959 REPORT IN SHANGHAI,The station conducted the 1959 report in Shanghai,15\n11884,JINZHOU CITY HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,1957 STUDY,The station conducted the 1957 study on Graphomya,14\n0,FAN ZIDE,SCIENCE PRESS,Fan Zide edited the second edition of the fly key published by Science Press,13\n67,FAN ZIDE,ZHONG JIANPING,Fan Zide's spouse provided critical support for the book's completion,12\n72,FAN ZIDE,CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES EAST CHINA INSTITUTE OF ENTOMOLOGY,Fan Zide is the editor-in-chief affiliated with the East China Institute of Entomology,12\n11898,FAN ZIDE,1957 ENTOMOLOGY JOURNAL ARTICLE,Fan Zide authored the 1957 journal article,12\n11911,FAN ZIDE,1957 STUDY IN ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,Fan Zide authored the 1957 study on fly species in Acta Entomologica Sinica,12\n11971,FAN ZIDE,PUBLICATION BY FAN ZIDE IN 1957,Fan Zide authored the 1957 publication,12\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
