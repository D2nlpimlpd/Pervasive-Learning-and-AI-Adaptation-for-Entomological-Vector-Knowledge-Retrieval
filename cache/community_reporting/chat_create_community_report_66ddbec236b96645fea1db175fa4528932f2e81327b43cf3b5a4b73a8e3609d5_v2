Body length 2.5-3.5 mm\",9\n2433,FENGCHENG,\"\n\nFengcheng is a city located in Liaoning Province, China, and serves as a significant ecological and geographical reference point for several species. The city is explicitly associated with the distribution of **Fengcheng Bellardia**, a species whose name incorporates the local designation \"\"Fengcheng,\"\" though the exact taxonomic classification or context of this species remains unspecified in the provided data. Additionally, Fengcheng is linked to the **genus Nemorilla**, a group of organisms (likely insects or plants, depending on the field of study) that are documented in the region. The city is also noted as a location where **Calliphora axata**, a species of blow fly, is recorded as part of its distribution range. Similarly, **Coenosia strigipes**, a species of fly in the family Muscidae, is associated with Fengcheng in Liaoning.  \n\nTwo descriptions mention \"\"the species\"\" in general terms, stating that Fengcheng is a location where a species is recorded or associated. While these entries lack specific names, they reinforce Fengcheng’s role as a site of biological interest, likely within entomology or regional biodiversity studies. The repeated emphasis on Liaoning, China, as the province ties all these entities to the same geographical context, suggesting Fengcheng may be a focal area for scientific observations or ecological surveys involving these organisms.  \n\nThe data does not present direct contradictions, as each description highlights different species or taxonomic groups connected to Fengcheng. However, the ambiguity in the third and fourth descriptions (\"\"the species is recorded\"\" and \"\"associated with the species\"\") requires interpretation. These could refer to unnamed species within the genera or families mentioned (e.g., Nemorilla, Calliphora, Coenosia) or to other taxa not explicitly listed. To resolve this, the summary consolidates all references under Fengcheng’s broader ecological profile, acknowledging the city’s documented ties to multiple species across varying taxonomic levels.  \n\nIn conclusion, Fengcheng, Liaoning, China, is a location with documented associations to **Fengcheng Bellardia**, the **genus Nemorilla**, **Calliphora axata**, and **Coenosia strigipes**, as well as unspecified species. Its role as a domestic site for these organisms underscores its potential importance in regional biodiversity, ecological research, or taxonomic studies. The city’s inclusion in multiple distribution records highlights its significance as a reference point for understanding the geographic ranges of these species within China. Further clarification on the unnamed species and the taxonomic status of \"\"Fengcheng Bellardia\"\" would enhance the precision of these associations.\",5\n5658,NEMORILLA FLORALIS,Nemorilla floralis is a species within the Nemorilla genus characterized by black transverse bands on abdominal tergites and a wide host range,4\n5655,NEMORILLA RONDANI,\"Nemorilla Rondani is a genus of tachinid flies with trapezoidal abdominal tergites, shorter and coarser bristles, and distinct black markings on the thorax and abdomen\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5171,COENOSIA STRIGIPES,STEIN,Stein described Coenosia strigipes in 1916,132\n10975,FENGCHENG,NEMORILLA FLORALIS,\"Nemorilla floralis is distributed in Fengcheng, Liaoning, China\",9\n10972,NEMORILLA RONDANI,NEMORILLA FLORALIS,Nemorilla floralis is a species within the Nemorilla genus,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
