The country hosts a diverse array of flies, including *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, and *Musca seniorwhitei*, as well as *Dichaetomyia luteiventer*, *Dichaetomyia apicalis*, and *Dichaetomyia quadrata*. It is also the type locality for *Dichaetomyia keiseri* and *Ceylonomyia nigripes*, underscoring its role in the taxonomic classification of these species. Additionally, Sri Lanka is home to *Caiusa testacea*, with *Bengalia labiata* as its type species, and supports populations of *Bengalia* spp., *Borbororhina bivittata*, *Borbororhinia bivittata*, *Haematobia minuta*, *Halydaia* and *Linnaemyia* spp., *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, *Leucomyia cinerea*, *Myospila argentata*, *Lasiopelta* spp., *Pegomya quadrivittata*, and the Indian greenbottle fly. Specific species such as *Anthomyia illocata*, *Anthomyia plumiseta*, *Atherigona exigua*, and *Atherigona triglomerata* are documented within its borders, alongside the Chinese-named species *紫翠蝇* (likely *Chrysomya bezziana* or a related *Chrysomya* species) and *612黄髭芒蝇* (possibly *Chrysomya pinguis* or another *Chrysomya* species). The genus *Stomorhina* is also reported to have multiple species distributed in Sri Lanka as a foreign location. Notably, Sri Lanka serves as a type locality for *Tainanina pilisquama* and *1394叉形亚麻蝇* (likely *Chrysomya pinguis* or a related species), while it is a foreign distribution site for *Musca crassirostris*, *Sarcophaga misera*, and *Sarcophaga sericea*. The country further records the presence of *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Neomyia* spp., and *Ophyra chalcogaster*.
