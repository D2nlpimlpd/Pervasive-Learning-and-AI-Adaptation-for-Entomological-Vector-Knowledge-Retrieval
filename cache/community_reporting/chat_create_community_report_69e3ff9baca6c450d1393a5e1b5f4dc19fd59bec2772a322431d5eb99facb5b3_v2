It has served as a platform for describing new species and documenting biodiversity in the African region. Two notable species have been introduced in this journal: *Alikangiella flava*, a taxon described by Villeneuve in 1927, and *Isomyia electa*, another species whose description was also published in the journal, though the specific author and year for *Isomyia electa* are not provided in the data. The journal’s role in taxonomic research is evident through its contributions to entomology and mycology, as both species belong to distinct biological groups—*Alikangiella flava* is a fungal species, while *Isomyia electa* is a dipteran insect. The absence of conflicting information in the descriptions allows for a unified summary, highlighting the journal’s significance in advancing knowledge of African flora and fauna. Its historical use by researchers like Villeneuve underscores its credibility as a source for taxonomic studies. The journal continues to be a reference for scientists working on African ecosystems, providing a repository for discoveries in zoological and botanical sciences.
