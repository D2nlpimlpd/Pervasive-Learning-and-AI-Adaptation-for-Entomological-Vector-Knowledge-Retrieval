First described by Rondani, the genus is characterized by distinct morphological features in both adult and larval stages. Adult Atherigona species typically exhibit short preapical dorsocentral bristles, a key taxonomic trait, and possess setae (bristles) on the anterior femur of their legs. These features help distinguish the genus from related groups within the Muscidae family. \n\nThe larvae of Atherigona are notable for their short, blunt projections and kidney-shaped or oval posterior spiracles, which are critical for respiration and further aid in identification. These larval characteristics align with the broader ecological and developmental patterns observed in muscid flies, though Atherigona's specific traits set it apart. \n\nThe genus is taxonomically diverse, with recognized subgenera such as *Acritochaeta*. This subgeneric classification reflects the evolutionary and morphological variability within Atherigona, though the exact number and relationships of subgenera may require further study. \n\nIn summary, Atherigona is a well-defined genus within the Muscidae family, distinguished by adult morphological markers like short dorsocentral bristles and setae on the anterior femur, as well as unique larval features including blunt projections and specific spiracle shapes. Its subgeneric structure, exemplified by *Acritochaeta*, highlights the complexity of its classification. The genus remains an important subject in entomological research due to its ecological roles and taxonomic distinctiveness. \n\n(Word count: 150)\",11\n2578,ATHERIGONA LATIBASIS,\"A species of fly with a three-leaf-like structure having a wide triangular base, 3.5 mm body length.
