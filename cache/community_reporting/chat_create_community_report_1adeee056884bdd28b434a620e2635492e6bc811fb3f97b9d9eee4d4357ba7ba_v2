It is known to occur in multiple geographic regions, including China, Europe, and North America. In China, its distribution has been documented in the northern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and Hebei, which are characterized by temperate climates and diverse ecosystems. The species is also present in Europe, with potential records in Germany, though its exact range across the continent remains less precisely defined. Additionally, **Hydrotaea bimaculata** has been reported in North America, indicating a transcontinental distribution. The fly’s presence in these regions suggests adaptability to a range of environmental conditions, though specific ecological preferences or behaviors are not detailed in the provided data.

Originally described as *Musca lardaria* by the Danish entomologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1781, the species was later reclassified into the genus *Polietes*. The type locality for this species is Germany, as established in its original description. However, subsequent taxonomic work has revealed additional regional records and synonyms. In 1965, a study by Fan identified a synonym for *Polietes lardaria*, *Polietes (Pseudomorellia) omeishanensis*, suggesting possible regional variations or historical misclassifications.  \n\nThe species is distributed across multiple geographic regions. It is native to China, specifically documented in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang. Beyond China, *Polietes lardaria* is also found in Mongolia, Japan, the former USSR, and parts of Europe. This wide distribution indicates its adaptability to diverse temperate and boreal climates. The inclusion of European populations aligns with the original type locality in Germany, while the records in Asia highlight its presence in both eastern and western regions of the continent.  \n\nTaxonomically, *Polietes lardaria* has undergone revisions. The initial placement in *Musca* by Fabricius reflects an older classification system, as modern phylogenetic studies have reorganized hoverflies into more accurate genera. The synonym *Polietes (Pseudomorellia) omeishanensis* further underscores the complexity of its taxonomic history, potentially representing a subspecies or a regional variant. Despite these historical shifts, the species is now consistently recognized under the genus *Polietes*.  \n\nEcologically, *Polietes lardaria* is likely to share traits with other hoverflies, such as mimicking bees or wasps for predator avoidance and feeding on nectar or pollen as adults. Its larvae may exhibit predatory or saprophagous behaviors, though specific details about its life cycle or ecological role are not provided in the descriptions. The species’ presence in both Europe and Asia suggests it may play a role in pollination or pest control in these regions.  \n\nThe discrepancy between the original 1781 description by Fabricius and the 1965 synonym by Fan highlights the evolving nature of taxonomic classifications. While the type locality remains Germany, the species’ broader distribution in Asia and Europe indicates it is not restricted to its original geographic context. Researchers should consider both historical and modern references to fully understand its taxonomy and biogeography.  \n\nIn summary, *Polietes lardaria* is a hoverfly species with a long taxonomic history, first described in 1781 and later synonymized in 1965. It inhabits temperate and boreal regions across Europe, Asia, and parts of the former USSR, with documented populations in Germany, China (Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang), Mongolia, Japan, and other areas. Its classification under *Polietes* reflects updated phylogenetic understanding, while the synonym *Pseudomorellia omeishanensis* points to regional taxonomic nuances. The species’ ecological significance and adaptability to varied climates remain areas for further study.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",13\n399,GERMANY,\"\n\nGermany, a European country, is associated with the type localities and distributions of numerous fly species across multiple genera. It serves as the type locality for **Phaonia incana**, **Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia**, and the **Pegoplata genus**, as well as for **PIERRETTIA NEMORALIS** and **PIERRETTIA CLATHRATA**. The country is also the type locality for **Scathophaga suilla**, **Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum**, **Hylemya vagans**, **Pegohylemyia striolata**, **Pegomya geniculata**, **Pegomya exilis**, **Pseudonupedia intersecta**, **Polietes lardaria**, **Halina moedlingensis**, **Pegomya seitenstellensis**, and **teretirostris**. Additionally, Germany is noted as the type locality for **Barbata Fannia** and **Leucosticta Fannia**, though the latter is described as \"\"likely\"\" located there.  \n\nIn terms of distribution, Germany hosts species such as **Coenosia incisurata**, **Coenosia flavicornis**, **Paraprosalpia sepiella**, **Parasarcophaga uliginosa**, **Helina latitarsis**, **Helina obscuratoides**, **Lispe leucospila**, **Lispe consanguinea**, and **Egle anthomyioides**. The Chinese names **毛踝厕蝇** and **尾须厕蝇** are also documented as distributed in Germany, though their Latin binomials are not provided. The genus **Helicophagella** is described as distributed in Germany, despite one entry ambiguously labeling it as a \"\"foreign country.\"\" Germany is further linked to potential type localities for **Hydrotaea bimaculata** and **Hydrotaea occulta**, as well as a possible type locality for **Muscina japonica**.  \n\nContradictions in the data, such as the conflicting \"\"abroad distribution location\"\" for *Scathophaga suilla* and the ambiguous \"\"foreign region\"\" designation for *Thricops semicinereus* and *Hydrophoria annulata*, are resolved by prioritizing the explicit references to Germany as the type locality or distribution site. For example, *Thricops semicinereus* is corrected to reflect Germany as its type locality, and *Hydrophoria annulata* is treated as a species distributed in Germany despite the \"\"foreign region\"\" phrasing.  \n\nOverall, Germany plays a significant role in entomological taxonomy as both a type locality and a distribution hub for a diverse array of fly species, spanning genera like *Pegomya*, *Lucilia*, *Lispe*, and *Hydrotaea*. Its contributions to the study of these insects are well-documented, with many species first described or observed within its borders.
