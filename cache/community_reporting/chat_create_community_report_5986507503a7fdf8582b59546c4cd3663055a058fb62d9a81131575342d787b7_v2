It is found in Liaoning, Shanxi, and Tibet, China.\",7\n1672,动物学研究,\"\n\n**动物学研究** (Zoological Research) is a Chinese academic journal specializing in the publication of zoological studies, with a focus on entomological research and the description of new or understudied species. The journal has a documented history of contributing to the taxonomy and biology of flies, particularly within the genus *Syngamoptera*. It has published studies on *Syngamoptera angustifrons* and *Syngamoptera unilineata*, two species of flies that are likely part of its broader entomological research portfolio. Additionally, the journal is noted for a 1980 study on *Chrysomya bezziana*, a blow fly species significant in forensic and ecological contexts, further underscoring its role in advancing knowledge of insect biology and systematics.  \n\nA key highlight of **动物学研究** is its publication of the description of *长白山点池蝇* (Changbaishan Point Fly), a species associated with the Changbai Mountains region. This contribution aligns with the journal’s emphasis on regional biodiversity and taxonomic work, particularly in documenting species native to China. The inclusion of *Syngamoptera* species, *Chrysomya bezziana*, and *长白山点池蝇* in its publications suggests a multidisciplinary approach, covering both general zoological research and specialized studies in dipteran (true fly) taxonomy.  \n\nThe journal’s scope appears to bridge foundational zoological science with applied entomological research. For instance, the 1980 study on *Chrysomya bezziana* may have implications for understanding fly ecology, decomposition processes, or forensic entomology, while the descriptions of *Syngamoptera* species and *长白山点池蝇* contribute to systematic biology and conservation efforts. By publishing these diverse studies, **动物学研究** serves as a platform for both domestic and international researchers to share findings on zoological topics, with a particular emphasis on insect species in China.  \n\nNotably, the journal’s focus on *Syngamoptera* and *Chrysomya* species indicates a specialization in the family Calliphoridae (blow flies) and related taxa, though the exact taxonomic relationships between *Syngamoptera angustifrons*, *Syngamoptera unilineata*, and *长白山点池蝇* require further clarification. The 1980 *Chrysomya bezziana* study, being a specific historical example, highlights the journal’s long-standing engagement with entomological research. Meanwhile, the description of *长白山点池蝇* reflects its commitment to documenting regional biodiversity, particularly in ecologically significant areas like the Changbai Mountains.  \n\nIn summary, **动物学研究** is a Chinese journal that publishes zoological research with a strong focus on entomology, including taxonomic descriptions of fly species such as *Syngamoptera angustifrons*, *Syngamoptera unilineata*, and *长白山点池蝇*, as well as broader studies like the 1980 work on *Chrysomya bezziana*. Its contributions span both foundational and applied research, emphasizing biodiversity documentation and systematic studies in China.

Additionally, Gulian is documented as a habitat for *Paraprosalpia flavipes*, a species of hoverfly, and *Delia longicauda*, a member of the Delia genus, which includes various species of root-maggot flies. These findings highlight Gulian’s ecological importance as a region where diverse dipteran species are distributed or have been first identified. The repeated mention of Heilongjiang province in all descriptions confirms the geographic consistency of the entity, while the inclusion of three distinct species emphasizes its biodiversity relevance.

It serves as a key platform for the description of new species and the documentation of distribution records, particularly for dipteran (fly) genera such as *Phaonia*, *Sinohylemya*, and *Phorbia*. The journal has a long-standing reputation for contributing to both domestic and international entomological research.  \n\nNotable species described or published in *动物分类学报* include *Blaesoxipha subunicolor*, *范氏细麻蝇* (Fan’s fine fly), *Hydrotaea monochaeta* (described by Ma and Wu in 1986), and *Phaonia maculobambusa*, *Phaonia brunneipalpis*, *Phaonia yanggaoensis*, and *Phaonia dawushanensis*. It has also featured studies on *Sinohylemya craspedodonta*, *Phorbia asiatica*, and *Phallosphaera amica*, as well as the genus *Helina*. Specific examples of its publications include a study in volume 6(2), pages 184–185, and other works on species like *曲股欧麻蝇* (European tachinid fly with curved femur) and *贺兰山欧麻蝇* (Hulanshan European tachinid fly).  \n\nThe journal emphasizes rigorous taxonomic analysis, often incorporating morphological, ecological, and geographic data to support species identification and classification. Its contributions extend beyond China, with records of species distribution spanning multiple regions. Researchers associated with the journal have included domestic scholars such as Ma and Wu, who described *Hydrotaea monochaeta*, and others who have documented the biodiversity of flies and related taxa.  \n\n*动物分类学报* plays a critical role in advancing the understanding of animal taxonomy, particularly for understudied or newly discovered species. By consolidating descriptions of diverse genera and species, it provides a comprehensive resource for entomologists and taxonomists. The journal’s bilingual approach—publishing both Chinese and English titles—enhances its accessibility to international audiences while maintaining its focus on Chinese biodiversity.  \n\nIn summary, *动物分类学报* is a vital Chinese publication for zoological taxonomy, recognized for its detailed species descriptions, distribution records, and contributions to the classification of dipteran and other animal taxa. Its work supports global and regional taxonomic databases, reflecting the journal’s commitment to scientific accuracy and biodiversity research.

It is recognized as a site associated with the distribution of two distinct species: *Lispe hirsutipes* and *Limnophora orbitalis*. Both species are documented to inhabit this region, underscoring Jin County's ecological significance as a habitat for these organisms. The presence of *Lispe hirsutipes*, a species within the genus *Lispe* (likely a fly or related insect), and *Limnophora orbitalis*, a member of the genus *Limnophora* (commonly found in wetland or aquatic environments), indicates the area's biodiversity and potential for supporting varied ecosystems. While the descriptions do not specify the exact habitats or interactions of these species within Jin County, their coexistence in the region highlights its role as a shared ecological niche. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both consistently identify Jin County as a location in Liaoning Province linked to these species.

This taxonomic group is characterized by distinct morphological features that aid in its identification. Notably, members of the genus exhibit **mostly bare eyes**, a trait that differentiates them from other related genera. In males, a defining characteristic is the **narrow forehead**, which contributes to their unique appearance. Additionally, the genus is distinguished by specific anatomical traits in the **wings and abdomen**, though the exact nature of these features is not detailed in the provided descriptions. As part of the Mydaeinae subfamily, *Mydaea* species are likely to share broader taxonomic and ecological traits with other members of this group, which includes small to medium-sized flies often associated with decaying organic matter or specific host environments. The combination of these physical attributes and subfamily classification provides a foundational understanding of *Mydaea* within the context of dipteran taxonomy.
