PONT is best known for their 1973 study on **sorghum shoot fly control**, which is frequently cited in literature related to this pest species. This study also includes descriptions of several **Atherigona** species, such as **613点芒蝇** and **614裸蹠芒蝇**, alongside contributions to the taxonomy of **Atherigona reversura**, **Atherigona oryzae**, **Atherigona kappa**, and **Atherigona phi** (described in 1981). Additionally, PONT authored the species description for **黑斑翠蝇 Neomyia (Scutellorthellia) lauta** in 1973 and inferred **Saint-Sauveur** as its type locality.  \n\nIn the 1970s, PONT documented the distribution of **Lispe leucospila** in the Soviet Union and **Caricea vernalis** in Mongolia (1986). They also contributed to the classification of **Phaonia** species, noting similarities between groups in 1970 and later reclassifying **Ph. fuscitibia** as a subspecies of **Ph. angelicae** in 1986. PONT described **Drymeia altica** (1981) and **Drymeia beelzebub**, as well as **Polietes orientalis** (1972) and **Polietes nigrolimbata** (1986). Their 1977 work documented species distribution in India and included the description of **Dasyphora kempi**, while also expressing skepticism about the identification of **污瓣莫蝇** in Taiwan.  \n\nPONT collaborated on the genus **Huckettomyia**, co-describing **Huckettomyia watanabei** in 1970 and authoring **Megophyra simpliceps**. They are cited as a reference for **European distribution data** and for describing **Atherigona triglomerata** and **Atherigona boninensis**. Their research on **Mesembrina** species further highlights their expertise in dipteran taxonomy.  \n\nThroughout their career, PONT demonstrated a focus on both ecological and taxonomic studies, with notable contributions to understanding the biology of agricultural pests like the sorghum shoot fly and the systematics of diverse fly groups. Their work remains a key source for species identification and distribution patterns in regions such as Asia, Europe, and the Soviet Union.
