Its vast and diverse geography supported a wide array of taxa, including flies and other arthropods, with many species documented in specific localities like the Ural Mountains, Krasnovodsk, Chiva, Tajikistan, and the Ussuri border. Key genera and species associated with the Soviet Union include *Macronychia striginervis* and *Macronychia polyodon*, as well as *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri*, *Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia*, and *Senotainia deserta*, *Apodacra*, and *Miltogrammoides*. The region was notable for hosting multiple *Helina* species, such as *Helina confinis* (Far East, Northern and Central Europe), *Helina cothurnata*, *Helina latitarsis*, and *Helina parcepilosa*, alongside *Parasarcophaga* species like *Parasarcophaga pleskei*, *Parasarcophaga portschinskyi*, and *Parasarcophaga emdeni*.  \n\nThe Soviet Union also harbored internationally distributed species, including *Phaonia* genera such as *Phaonia fuscata* (Far East, Western Siberia, Tajikistan, and northern/central European regions), *Phaonia hybrida*, *Phaonia malaisei*, and *Phaonia villana*, as well as *Phormia regina* (European part, Siberia, Transbaikal). Notable localities included the Far East Primorsky Krai, where *Gymnadichosia pusilla*, *Pollenomyia okazakii*, and *Pollenomyia sinensis* were recorded, and Central Asia, home to *Alashan Wohlfahrtia* (Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan) and *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* (Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan). Species like *Strobilomyia laricicola* (Siberia) and *Protophormia terraenovae* (European, Siberian, and other regions) further underscored its ecological diversity.  \n\nThe region was also linked to the distribution of *Sarcophaga* species, including *Sarcophaga semenovi*, *Sarcophaga misera*, *Sarcophaga sericea*, and *Sarcophaga aegyptica*, as well as *Musca larvipara* and *Musca sorbens*. Specific localities like Kamchatka and the southern Turkmen region were highlighted for species such as the Brush Spring Fly and *Musca crassirostris*. Additionally, the Soviet Union hosted *Tachina albidopilosa* (Siberia, Ural Mountains) and *Servillia ardens*, *Tachina nupta*, and *Oestrus* (Central Asia, southern Europe).  \n\nChinese-named species like 1279膨端折麻蝇 (1279 Swollen Apex Tachinid Fly), 1280钩阳折麻蝇 (1280 Hooked Yang Tachinid Fly), and 1281毛股折麻蝇 (1281 Hairy Thigh Tachinid Fly) were documented, alongside *古北蝗蝇* (Palaearctic Locust Fly) in Kazakhstan and *肖瘤胫厕蝇* (Small Knob-legged Housefly). Genera such as *Adia*, *Oestromyia*, *Lispe* (e.g., *Lispe frigida* in Siberia, *Lispe odessae* in Odessa), and *Blaesoxipha* (e.g., *Blaesoxipha unicolor*, *Blaesoxipha litoralis*) were also present. Research contributions from Soviet Union scientists, such as K.Б. Борнцова-Энненбейгена on *Holotrichia diomphalia*, and taxonomic work on *Sarcophagini* and *Sinonipponia* in the Far East, further emphasize its role in entomological studies.  \n\nDespite its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet Union remains a critical reference in historical distribution records, with species like *Metopodia grisea* (Central Asia, Western Siberia) and *Hydrotaea palaestrica* noted for their presence in its former territories.
