Specific localities such as **Li County Miaoliu**, **Ganzi**, and **Miyao** are noted for their ecological significance in supporting these species. \n\nThis summary consolidates Sichuan’s extensive entomological records, emphasizing its importance as a center for studying both common and rare fly species, with many type localities and multiple genera (e.g., *Parasarcophaga*, *Phaonia*, *Drymeia*) represented across its cities and natural features.\",185\n1920,HENGDUAN MOUNTAINS INSECTS,\"\n\nThe **Hengduan Mountains Insects** are a subject of significant scientific interest due to the region's unique biodiversity and ecological complexity. The Hengduan Mountains, a mountain range in southwestern China spanning Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces, host a rich array of insect species, many of which are endemic or understudied. Two notable studies have contributed to the documentation of this fauna. The first, published in a journal, describes two species of the genus *Phaonia*—*Phaonia mimobasiseta* and *Phaonia caudilata*—in volume 2, page 1237. These species, likely blowflies (family Calliphoridae), are part of the broader research into the region's dipteran diversity, which plays critical roles in ecosystems as decomposers, pollinators, and food sources. The second study focuses on *Drymeia* species, a genus within the family Muscidae, and documents their presence in the same provinces (Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai). This publication highlights the taxonomic and ecological significance of *Drymeia* in the Hengduan Mountains, emphasizing the area's role as a hotspot for muscid fly diversity. Together, these works underscore the importance of the Hengduan Mountains as a key region for entomological research, where both *Phaonia* and *Drymeia* species contribute to the understanding of local insect communities. The studies also reflect the fragmented yet growing body of knowledge about the area's insects, with each publication addressing distinct genera and geographic subsets. While the first study provides specific taxonomic details for *Phaonia* species, the second expands the scope to *Drymeia*, illustrating the range of dipteran adaptations in the region's varied habitats. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they reference separate species and publications. Collectively, they reinforce the Hengduan Mountains' status as a vital area for conserving and studying insect biodiversity, with ongoing research continuing to uncover new species and ecological relationships. These findings are essential for informing conservation strategies and understanding the impacts of environmental changes on fragile alpine and subtropical ecosystems.\",5\n5119,1352 LINGULATE PIERRETIAS,,5\n1981,MESAMBRIANA RESPLENDENS CILIIMACULATA,A subspecies of Mesembrina resplendens described by Fan and Zheng,4\n3871,ONESIA CHUANXIENSIS,\"A species of fly described by Chen et Fan in 1992, with a slender, forward-curved lateral lobe and a hooked terminal process.

This region is characterized by its rugged topography, high biodiversity, and ecological significance, serving as a critical area for scientific research. The Hengduan Mountains are particularly notable for their role in entomological studies, as highlighted in two key references. First, they are referenced in the study of *Drymeia* species, a genus of flies within the family Muscidae, which underscores the area’s importance as a habitat for diverse insect populations. Second, the Hengduan Mountains are associated with the publication *Insects of the Hengduan Mountains*, a work that likely documents the region’s rich insect fauna and contributes to broader understanding of its ecosystems. These studies emphasize the Hengduan Mountains as a hotspot for biodiversity, where unique environmental conditions support specialized species and provide opportunities for taxonomic and ecological research. The mountain range’s geographical complexity, including steep gradients and varied microclimates, further enhances its value as a natural laboratory for investigating evolutionary processes and species adaptation. Collectively, the descriptions position the Hengduan Mountains as a vital region in China for both geographical and biological sciences, particularly in the context of insect diversity and conservation.\",2\n1706,CHONGQING JINYUN SHAN,\"Chongqing Jinyun Mountain in Sichuan, a distribution site for Xenotachina chongqingensis\",1\n1707,CHONGQING NASHAN,\"Chongqing Nanshan in Sichuan, a distribution site for Xenotachina chongqingensis\",1\n2090,JINTANG,\"\n\nJINTANG is a county-level administrative division located in Sichuan Province, China. While one description refers to it as a \"\"city,\"\" this likely reflects a common but imprecise usage of the term in Chinese administrative terminology, where \"\"city\"\" can sometimes encompass both urban and county-level jurisdictions. Officially, Jintang is classified as a county, which is a sub-provincial administrative unit within the province. It is situated in the eastern part of Sichuan, contributing to the region's diverse geographical and cultural landscape.  \n\nThe county is notable for its mention in the taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, a family of flies (Sarcophagidae) in the order Diptera. This reference suggests that Jintang may serve as a type locality or a significant location for the study, classification, or observation of certain Sarcophagini species. Such taxonomic associations often highlight areas with unique ecological conditions or biodiversity, which could be relevant to entomological research in the region. However, the specific scientific context or species linked to Jintang in this key is not detailed in the provided descriptions.  \n\nSichuan Province, where Jintang is located, is known for its mountainous terrain, including parts of the Sichuan Basin and the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The province is also culturally and historically rich, with a history of significant contributions to Chinese civilization. As a county, Jintang would fall under the jurisdiction of a prefecture-level city, though the exact parent city is not specified in the data.  \n\nIn summary, JINTANG is a county in Sichuan Province, China, recognized both as an administrative unit and as a geographical reference in entomological taxonomy. Its dual designation as a \"\"city\"\" and \"\"county\"\" underscores the nuances of Chinese administrative terminology, where lower-level divisions may be colloquially referred to as cities. The mention in the Sarcophagini taxonomic key indicates its relevance to scientific studies, though further details on this connection remain unexplored in the given data. The entity’s role within Sichuan’s administrative framework and its ecological significance, if any, warrant additional context for a more complete understanding.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",1\n2091,FENGJIE,\"Fengjie is a city in Sichuan province, China\",1\n2092,ZHAOJUE,\"\n\nZhaojue is a county-level city located in Sichuan Province, China. It is often described as a city within the province, but its administrative classification as a county-level city clarifies that it functions as a sub-prefectural division, subordinate to a prefecture-level city (though the specific prefecture is not mentioned in the provided data). This dual reference to \"\"city\"\" and \"\"county\"\" reflects the nuanced structure of Chinese administrative divisions, where county-level cities are considered part of the county tier but operate with municipal governance. Zhaojue is also explicitly noted as a county in Sichuan Province, aligning with its role in local governance and regional identity.  \n\nBeyond its administrative context, Zhaojue holds significance in scientific literature, particularly in the taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, a family of flies (Diptera: Sarcophagidae). This reference suggests that the location may be associated with entomological studies, biodiversity documentation, or ecological research related to these insects. The inclusion of Zhaojue in such a key highlights its relevance as a geographical identifier for classifying or studying Sarcophagini species, potentially due to its unique environmental conditions or documented presence of specific taxa.  \n\nThe entity \"\"Zhaojue\"\" thus represents both a political-administrative unit in Sichuan and a geographical marker in specialized scientific contexts. While the descriptions initially appear contradictory by labeling it as both a city and a county, this is resolved by understanding China’s administrative hierarchy, where county-level cities are a recognized category. Its mention in the Sarcophagini taxonomic key underscores its utility in academic and biological frameworks, adding a layer of scientific importance to its regional profile.  \n\nZhaojue’s role as a county-level city implies it serves as a hub for local governance, economic activities, and cultural preservation within Sichuan. The province itself is known for its diverse landscapes, historical heritage, and ecological significance, which may contribute to Zhaojue’s relevance in both administrative and scientific domains.

It serves as a key habitat for multiple genera and species, including **Atherigona reversura**, **Atherigona oryzae**, and **Atherigona triglomerata**, which are documented in the area. The region is also associated with **Musca malaisei** and **Musca seniorwhitei**, as well as the Chinese species **611扁蹠芒蝇** (likely *Atherigona sp.*) and **612黄髭芒蝇** (*Atherigona sp.*). Additionally, Xishuangbanna is the type locality for three *Isomyia* species: **Isomyia sagittalis**, **Isomyia quadrina**, and **Isomyia verirecta**, and it hosts **Isomyia isomyia** and **Isomyia viridaurea** as part of their broader distribution.  \n\nThe area is notable for the presence of **Achoetandrus rufifacies**, a species linked to its ecological context in Yunnan. Xishuangbanna is also a distribution site for **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly** (*Pierretia caudagalli*), **1340杯细麻蝇** (*Musca sp.*), and **Ceylonomyia nigripes**. It is explicitly mentioned as the domestic and foreign distribution site for **云南亚麻蝇** (Yunnan Atherigona fly), with the Chinese name **中国云南西双版纳** (Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China) cited as its type locality. The region further supports **Sarcorohdendorfia inextricata** and **Hypopygiopsis infumata**, the latter of which is specifically noted to include the sub-region **Daminglong** within Xishuangbanna.  \n\nXishuangbanna’s ecological importance is underscored by its role as a habitat for these diverse species, many of which are endemic or have limited geographic ranges. The descriptions consistently identify it as part of Yunnan Province, with some specifying it as a \"\"sublocation\"\" in broader distribution contexts. While terms like \"\"location,\"\" \"\"region,\"\" and \"\"city\"\" are used interchangeably in the data, Xishuangbanna is officially a prefecture-level city in Yunnan, encompassing both urban and rural areas. Its tropical and subtropical climate, along with rich ecosystems, likely contribute to the presence of such a wide array of fly species, including those with scientific names in both Latin and Chinese. The region’s status as a type locality for several species highlights its significance in entomological research.  \n\nIn summary, XISHUANGBANNA is a biodiverse hub in Yunnan, China, where multiple fly species—spanning genera like *Atherigona*, *Musca*, *Isomyia*, and others—are documented, with some having their type localities or primary distributions there. Key species include *Atherigona reversura*, *Musca malaisei*, *Isomyia sagittalis*, *Achoetandrus rufifacies*, and *Hypopygiopsis infumata*, among others, with sub-regions like Daminglong playing a role in specific distributions. The area’s ecological and taxonomic relevance is further emphasized by its association with both domestic and international scientific records.
