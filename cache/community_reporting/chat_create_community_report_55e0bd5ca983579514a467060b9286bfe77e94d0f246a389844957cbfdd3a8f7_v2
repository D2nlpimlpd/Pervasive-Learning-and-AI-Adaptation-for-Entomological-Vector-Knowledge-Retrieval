Active in both taxonomic research and ecological documentation, KANO's work spans multiple regions, including Japan, Micronesia, and Taiwan, and involves collaborations with other scientists. Their earliest recorded contribution dates to 1950, when they described the species *拟野亚麻蝇* (likely *Ph. fuscitibia* or a related *Phaonia* species). In 1953 and 1954, KANO authored multiple references to *1339上海细麻蝇* (possibly *Ph. xanthofemina*), and in 1956, they co-described *Sarcophaga furutonensis* with Okazaki and *Sarcophaga shiroganensis* with another collaborator.  \n\nKANO's 1960s work includes foundational studies on the genus *Xanthotryxus* in 1968, as well as co-authoring a 1968 study on fly species characteristics referenced in broader literature. They were also involved in documenting the distribution of flies in Micronesia in 1968, alongside other researchers. Notably, KANO described the species *Melinda itoi* in 1962 and co-authored a 1968 study on *Melinda* species. In 1964, they co-described *Robineauella (D.) uemotoi*, and in 1966, they contributed to the description of *Protocalliphora maruyamensis*. Additionally, KANO is cited as an author for the type locality of *Brontaea ezensis* and for studies on *Phaonia bambusa*, *Phaonia luteovittata*, and *Phaonia ryukyuensis*.  \n\nThe 1970s saw KANO's continued focus on taxonomic classifications, including co-establishing the *Horia* genus in 1967 and studying the genus *Neomyia* in 1973. They also co-described *Sarcosolomonia harinasutai* in 1977 and *Ophyra okazakii* in 1971. In 1973, KANO was associated with a report on fly species, and their work on *Stomoxys uruma* (co-described with Shinonaga in 1966) and *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Paradichosia tsukamotoi* further highlights their expertise in dipteran taxonomy.  \n\nKANO's research also extended to the 1980s, with studies on species differences in 1983 and 1987. They were cited for specimen collection in Japan and for the distribution of *Pyrellia cyanicolor* in Taiwan. Their collaborations often involved prominent entomologists, as seen in co-authoring works on *Gymnadichosia pusilla* and *Pollenomyia okazakii*.  \n\nOverall, KANO's career reflects a deep engagement with the taxonomy and ecology of flies, particularly within the *Phaonia*, *Melinda*, and *Sarcophaga* genera. Their work, frequently collaborative, advanced the understanding of species distribution, morphological characteristics, and regional biodiversity in Asia. Key publications include studies on *Xanthotryxus* (1968), *Horia* (1967), and multiple *Phaonia* species, alongside contributions to the classification of *Stomoxys uruma* and *Ophyra okazakii*. KANO's legacy is marked by meticulous documentation and the establishment of new taxonomic frameworks, solidifying their role as a pivotal figure in entomological research during the 20th century.\",29\n1745,SHINONAGA,\"\n\nSHINONAGA, a Japanese entomologist, is recognized for his significant contributions to the taxonomy and distribution studies of dipteran species, particularly flies, across Asia and the Pacific. His work spans multiple decades, with notable publications beginning in 1966. In that year, he co-authored the description of *Protocalliphora maruyamensis* and, alongside Kano, described *Stomoxys uruma*. By 1968, Shinonaga was actively involved in documenting the distribution of flies in Micronesia, collaborating with Kano on a study of *Melinda* species and contributing to a broader 1968 report on fly species characteristics. He also co-authored the 1968 documentation of *Neomyia indica* in Thailand and was cited for specimen collection in Japan.  \n\nIn 1969, Shinonaga expanded his research to include the study of *Iranihindia*, a genus of flies. The following year, 1970, marked his description of *Neomyia ruficornis*, further solidifying his expertise in the *Neomyia* genus. In 1973, he co-authored a fly species report and conducted a detailed study of the *Neomyia* genus, demonstrating his ongoing focus on this group. His 1979 work was particularly prolific: he proposed the synonymy of *Pierretia melania* for *Dinemomyia nigribasicosta*, co-established the genus *Kanomyia*, and described the genus *Hosarcophaga*. Additionally, he co-described *Huckettomyia watanabei* and *Megophyra simpliceps*, and was associated with the species *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Paradichosia tsukamotoi*.  \n\nShinonaga’s taxonomic contributions include the description of several species, such as *Phaonia bambusa*, *Phaonia fuscitibia*, *Phaonia ryukyuensis*, and *Ophyra okazakii*, as well as the genus *Xanthotryxus* in 1968. He also provided the type locality for *Brontaea ezensis*, a critical detail for its classification. His collaborative efforts, particularly with Kano, were instrumental in advancing the understanding of fly biodiversity in regions like Japan, Micronesia, and Taiwan, as evidenced by his co-authorship on the 1966 *Protocalliphora maruyamensis* and 1968 *Melinda* species studies.  \n\nShinonaga’s work reflects a multidisciplinary approach, addressing both regional distribution patterns and morphological characteristics of dipteran taxa. His research on *Tricholioproctia flavinervis* synonymy and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* in Taiwan highlights his role in clarifying taxonomic relationships and geographic ranges. Through these efforts, Shinonaga has left a lasting impact on the field of entomology, particularly in the systematic study of flies in East Asia and the Pacific. His publications remain foundational references for understanding the diversity and classification of these insects.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",25\n2112,SHINONAGA ET KANO,\"\n\nSHINONAGA ET KANO are researchers associated with the study of entomology, particularly in Japan, and have made notable contributions to the description of insect species. Their work spans multiple decades, with key publications in 1971, 1973, and 1977. In 1971, they were contributors to a study in Japan, where they described the species *Phaonia bambusa*. This research was part of the *Fauna Japan* project, a significant taxonomic and ecological reference for Japanese fauna. The same 1971 study also marked their involvement in broader entomological research, though specific details about the scope of this work remain tied to their description of *Phaonia bambusa*.  \n\nIn 1973, SHINONAGA ET KANO expanded their contributions by focusing on the larval stages of insects, providing detailed descriptions that advanced understanding of developmental morphology in the field. This work, while not specifying a particular species, highlights their expertise in life cycle studies, which are critical for ecological and taxonomic research.  \n\nTheir most prominent achievement, however, came in 1977 with the description of the *Asian housefly* (*Musca asiatica*), a species distinct from the more commonly studied *Musca domestica*. This work likely addressed the taxonomy, distribution, or biological characteristics of *Musca asiatica*, contributing to the differentiation of housefly species in Asia.  \n\nCollectively, SHINONAGA ET KANO’s research underscores their role in documenting Japanese insect biodiversity, with a focus on both adult and larval forms. Their 1971 *Phaonia bambusa* study, linked to *Fauna Japan*, and their 1977 work on the Asian housefly demonstrate their impact on taxonomic science, while the 1973 larval descriptions reflect their methodological rigor in entomological research. Though the descriptions provided do not clarify the exact nature of their 1971 study beyond *Phaonia bambusa*, it is reasonable to infer that their 1971 and 1973 works were part of a cohesive effort to catalog and analyze insect life stages and species in Japan. Their legacy remains tied to foundational contributions in the 1970s, advancing knowledge of dipteran taxonomy and ecology.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",3\n1837,\"JPN.JOURN,SANIT.ZOOL.\",The journal where Huckettomyia watanabei was described in 1970,2\n4280,\"BULL.

He is primarily associated with research on the distribution and classification of species within the genera *Neomyia*, *Calliphora*, *Kanomyia*, and *Hosarcophaga*. TUMRASVIN's work on *Neomyia indica* in Thailand has been cited as a key reference for understanding the geographic range of this species. Additionally, he contributed to the documentation of *Calliphora pattoni*, with his 1976 study providing foundational distribution data for this species.  \n\nIn 1979, TUMRASVIN co-authored a significant study on the Star Island Greenbottle Fly (*Neomyia cornuta*), which expanded knowledge of its distribution across Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. This research highlights his role in analyzing the biogeographic patterns of blow flies in the region. The same year, he was also involved in the taxonomic description of the genus *Hosarcophaga*, a contribution to the classification of blow flies.  \n\nTUMRASVIN's 1976 collaborative work, cited as *Tumrasvin et al.*, focused on the foreign origins of certain *Calliphora* species, underscoring his interest in the historical and ecological contexts of fly populations. Furthermore, he co-established the genus *Kanomyia*, which represents a taxonomic advancement in the field. His citations in studies related to *Neomyia* species distribution, including *Neomyia indica*, reflect his broader expertise in the ecology and systematics of this genus.  \n\nWhile some descriptions mention overlapping timelines (e.g., 1976 and 1979), these appear to reference distinct studies or collaborative efforts, as the 1976 work on *Calliphora pattoni* and foreign origins is attributed to a team, whereas the 1979 *Hosarcophaga* and *Neomyia cornuta* studies are linked to his individual or collaborative taxonomic and biogeographic research. TUMRASVIN’s work remains a critical resource for understanding the diversity and geographic spread of blow flies in Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand, where he has documented multiple species. His contributions to both species-level distribution data and higher-level taxonomic classifications demonstrate a comprehensive approach to entomological research.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",7\n1831,FAUNA JAPONICA,\"\n\n**FAUNA JAPONICA** is a comprehensive publication and journal dedicated to the study and documentation of Japanese fauna, particularly focusing on entomological species. It serves as a critical resource for taxonomists and researchers, providing detailed descriptions and classifications of various organisms native to Japan. The journal includes a section on the family *Muscidae*, where the species *Phaonia fuscitibia* was described on page 177. Additionally, it features entries on the species *Ophyra chalcogaster* and *Ophyra okazakii*, both belonging to the genus *Ophyra* within the same *Muscidae* family. These descriptions highlight the biodiversity of flies in Japan, offering insights into their morphology, ecology, and taxonomic relationships. By consolidating information on multiple species across its sections, *FAUNA JAPONICA* contributes to the broader understanding of regional fauna and supports scientific efforts in species identification and conservation. Its structured approach, with dedicated pages for specific taxa, ensures clarity and accessibility for specialists in the field.\",3\n3978,XANTHOTRYXUS,\"\n\nXANTHOTRYXUS is a genus of flies that is distinct from the genus *Pollenia*, as noted in the provided text. It is characterized by species such as *X. mongol*, which exhibit a large body size, typically measuring 9–13 mm in length. Members of this genus are further distinguished by the presence of golden thoracic hairs, a notable feature that contributes to their taxonomic identification. Additionally, they possess specific morphological traits in their wings and legs, though the exact nature of these features is not detailed in the descriptions. The geographic distribution of *XANTHOTRYXUS* spans East Asia, with records from China, Japan, and South Korea. These regions likely represent the primary habitats for the genus, though further research may clarify whether their range extends beyond these areas. The combination of size, coloration, and structural characteristics positions *XANTHOTRYXUS* as a unique group within the fly family, separate from *Pollenia*. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, allowing for a unified summary that integrates all provided details.\",3\n2342,NEOMYIA,,6\n4823,HOSARCOHPHAGA,,3\n2357,PACIF INS,Pacif Ins is a journal that published Neomyia species descriptions,1\n2360,ECOLOGICAL HABIT OF NEOMYIA,The ecological habit of adult Neomyia flies preferring to contact human feces,1\n3380,FAUNA JAPAN,\"\n\n**FAUNA JAPAN** is a Japanese entomological journal that serves as a key resource for the study and documentation of insect species, particularly within the genus *Phaonia*. It has been referenced for the formal description of *Phaonia bambusa*, a species within this genus, as well as related species, indicating its role in advancing taxonomic research on flies. Additionally, the journal published the description of *Phaonia ryukyuensis*, further establishing its significance in the field of entomology. These contributions highlight **FAUNA JAPAN** as a platform for detailed scientific analyses and species classifications, supporting both regional and global understanding of biodiversity. The journal’s focus on entomological studies, combined with its publication of specific *Phaonia* species, underscores its importance in documenting and disseminating research on Japanese insect fauna.\",2\n4822,HOSARCOHPHAGA SERRATA,,2\n5226,FIELD,Co-author of the 1964 description of Robineauella (D.) uemotoi,1\n2412,JAPAN.J. SANIT.ZOOL.,\"Japan Journal of Sanitary Zoology, a scientific journal where species descriptions are published\",2\n4810,LOPES,\"\n\n**Lopes** is a taxonomist recognized for two significant contributions to the field of biological classification. First, in 1959, Lopes established the *Johnstonimyia* genus, a foundational act in entomology that reflects their expertise in defining and categorizing insect species. This work likely involved rigorous morphological analysis and the application of taxonomic principles to distinguish *Johnstonimyia* as a distinct taxonomic group.  \n\nAdditionally, Lopes co-authored a 1979 study that compared specimens of *Sarcorohdendorfia inextricata* and *Sarcorohdendorfia antilope*. This research would have entailed detailed examination of the morphological, ecological, or genetic characteristics of these two species to elucidate their relationships, differences, or taxonomic placement within the *Sarcorohdendorfia* genus. The collaboration on this study highlights Lopes’ engagement with comparative taxonomy and their role in advancing understanding of biodiversity in the late 20th century.  \n\nTaken together, Lopes’ work spans over two decades, demonstrating a commitment to both the creation of new taxonomic classifications and the comparative analysis of existing species. Their establishment of *Johnstonimyia* in 1959 and subsequent 1979 study on *Sarcorohdendorfia* specimens underscore their dual contributions to systematics: defining novel genera and refining the classification of related species through empirical research. These efforts have provided valuable frameworks for subsequent studies in entomology and taxonomy, ensuring the accurate identification and categorization of organisms within these groups.  \n\nThe descriptions do not present contradictions, as they reference distinct taxonomic contributions (a genus in 1959 and a species-level study in 1979) by the same individual. By integrating these details, the summary reflects Lopes’ multifaceted role in advancing taxonomic science.

In 1956, Okazaki co-described two species within this genus: *Sarcophaga shiroganensis* and *Sarcophaga furutonensis*. The latter, *S. furutonensis*, was designated as the type species for the group they studied, and this work was conducted in collaboration with another researcher, Kano. While the specific collaborator for *S. shiroganensis* is not mentioned in the provided descriptions, both contributions highlight Okazaki’s role in advancing the classification of *Sarcophaga* species during the mid-20th century. These descriptions are consistent in attributing the 1956 publications to Okazaki, with no contradictions identified.
