As a prominent mountain in the region, it serves as a critical habitat for various insect populations, including the notable species *Chaetostoma bispinum* (双栉客夜蝇), for which it is recognized as the type locality. The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the specific geographic location where a species is first identified and described, making Jinfoshan Mountain a key site in entomological research. The mountain's unique environmental conditions, such as its elevation, climate, and biodiversity, likely contribute to the distinct distribution patterns of fly species observed there. These characteristics highlight its role in supporting specialized ecosystems and providing insights into the biogeography of insects in southwestern China.
