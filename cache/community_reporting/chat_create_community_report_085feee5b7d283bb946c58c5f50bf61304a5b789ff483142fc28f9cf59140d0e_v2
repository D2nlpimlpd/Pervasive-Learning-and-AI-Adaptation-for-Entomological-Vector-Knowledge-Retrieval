Active primarily in the 1980s, YE described multiple species across different genera, including *Parasarcophaga nanpingensis* (1980), *Heteronychia macromembrana* (1980), and the genus *Pterosarcophaga* (1981). In 1981, they also authored the description of *1338舟曲细麻蝇* (Zhouqu fine tachinid fly), a species with a Chinese name. Their work in 1982 included *Robineauella nigribasicosta*, and in 1983, they described *Lucilia (Phaenicia) angustifrontata*.  \n\nYE collaborated on several projects, co-authoring the description of *范氏细麻蝇* (Fan’s fine tachinid fly) in 1985 and the new species *Sarcosolomonia hongheensis*. In 1985, they independently described *Iranihindia spinosa*. Additionally, they were cited for providing domestic distribution data of a fly species in China, underscoring their role in documenting regional biodiversity. Notably, YE is also referenced for a 1962 publication, though the specific content of this work is not detailed in the provided data.  \n\nAmong their most notable works are the 1980 descriptions of two *Pierretia* species: *1350 Globular Vesicle Pierretia Fly* and *1352 Lingulate Pierretia Fly*. These contributions, along with the genus *Pterosarcophaga*, highlight their expertise in tachinid flies. YE further described *GLOBOVESICA SARCOPHAGA* in 1980, though the exact species name appears inconsistent with other entries (likely a typographical variation of the 1350 Globular Vesicle Pierretia Fly). They also described *贺兰山欧麻蝇* (Helanshan European tachinid fly), a species associated with the Helan Mountains in China.  \n\nYE’s research spans both taxonomic descriptions and ecological documentation, with a focus on Chinese fly species. Their work in the 1980s established foundational knowledge for understanding the diversity and distribution of tachinid and sarcophagid flies in the region. Collaborations, such as the co-description of *Sarcosolomonia hongheensis*, further demonstrate their engagement with peers in advancing entomological science. Despite some inconsistencies in species naming (e.g., \"\"1338舟曲细麻蝇\"\" and \"\"1350 Globular Vesicle Pierretia Fly\"\" likely refer to the same species), the cumulative evidence positions YE as a key figure in the study of dipteran taxonomy, particularly for species native to China. Their legacy includes over a dozen species and genus-level classifications, reflecting a sustained and impactful career in the field.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",34\n5339,PARASARCOPHAGA NANPINGENSIS,\"A species of fly described by Ye in 1980, found in Sichuan (Nanping as the type locality) in China\",3\n4843,PTEROSARCOPHAGA,,2\n5110,GLOBOVESICA SARCOPHAGA,\"A species of fly (Pierretia globovesica) described by Ye in 198, with specific tail and abdominal features.

The entity is primarily associated with **Fujian Province**, where it is recognized as a city and the habitat for certain species. However, there is a notable contradiction in the data: three descriptions explicitly link \"\"Nanping\"\" to **Sichuan Province** as the type locality for specific species, while one description correctly identifies it as a city in **Fujian Province**. This discrepancy likely arises from a mix-up in the naming of type localities, as \"\"Nanping\"\" is a real city in Fujian but may also be used as a geographic reference in Sichuan for taxonomic purposes.  \n\nIn **Sichuan Province**, \"\"Nanping\"\" is cited as the type locality for **Parasarcophaga nanpingensis**, a species of sarcophagid fly, and for the **1352 Lingulate Pierretia Fly** (scientific name not fully provided in the data). Additionally, it is noted as a sublocation in Sichuan where **Heteronychia macromembrana**, another fly species, is found. These references highlight the role of the Sichuan-based \"\"Nanping\"\" in entomological taxonomy, serving as a critical geographic anchor for the classification of these species.  \n\nConversely, the **Nanping City** in **Fujian Province** is a distinct entity, known as a real administrative city in southeastern China. While the data does not specify which species are associated with Fujian’s Nanping, it is clear that the city exists independently of the Sichuan sublocation. The confusion between the two may stem from similar names or errors in taxonomic documentation, as both provinces have regions named \"\"Nanping\"\" but are geographically and administratively separate.  \n\nTo resolve the contradiction, it is essential to distinguish between the two entities:  \n1. **Nanping City, Fujian Province**: A legitimate city in Fujian, likely associated with its own ecological or biological significance, though details are not provided in the data.  \n2. **Nanping (Sichuan sublocation)**: A geographic reference in Sichuan, designated as the type locality for **Parasarcophaga nanpingensis**, the **1352 Lingulate Pierretia Fly**, and **Heteronychia macromembrana**. This usage of \"\"Nanping\"\" appears to be a localized or historical term within Sichuan’s scientific community, unrelated to the Fujian city.  \n\nThe summary clarifies that while the name \"\"Nanping\"\" is shared, the two refer to different regions in China. The Sichuan sublocation is pivotal for the taxonomy of the listed fly species, whereas the Fujian city is a separate entity. This distinction ensures coherence in understanding the entity’s dual references.
