His work primarily focused on Diptera (flies), with notable contributions to the classification of species within the genera *Delia*, *Blaesoxipha*, *Sarcophaga*, *Roeselia*, *Robineauella*, and *Hydrophoria*. \n\nIn 1896, Pandelle authored descriptions for several species, including *Roeselia atricula*, *Blaesoxipha gladiatrix*, *Blaesoxipha cochlearis*, *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa*, *Peteina laticeps*, *Meigenia grandigena*, *Robineauella scoparia*, and *Sarcophaga scoparia*. He also described the species *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (likely a Chinese name for a fly species, possibly *Delia interflua* or another *Delia* species) in the same year. Additionally, he is credited with the type species *Sarcophaga incisilobata* and *Sarcophaga subulata*, though the exact year for these is unspecified in the data. \n\nBy 1900, Pandelle expanded his taxonomic work to include *Nupedia patellans* and *Delia flabellifera*. However, there is a discrepancy in the data regarding *Delia interflua*: some sources cite its description in 1896, while others attribute it to 1900. This inconsistency may reflect differing publication records or a typographical error, but the 1896 date is more frequently mentioned. Similarly, *Eglconcomitans* (possibly a misspelling of *Egle concomitans*) is listed as a species he described, though the year is unclear. \n\nPandelle’s contributions to the genus *Meigenia* included the 1896 description of *Meigenia grandigena*, and he was also associated with the classification of *Hydrophoria annulata*, though the nature of this involvement (e.g., description, revision) is unspecified. His work on *Blaesoxipha* and *Sarcophaga* species highlights his expertise in fly taxonomy, particularly in defining morphological and ecological distinctions within these groups. \n\nDespite the lack of detailed biographical information, Pandelle’s legacy is preserved through his meticulous species descriptions, which remain foundational in entomological literature. His 1896 publications, in particular, demonstrate a prolific output, covering a range of species that span both well-established and less commonly referenced genera. The conflicting dates for *Delia interflua* and *Egle concomitans* suggest the need for further verification in taxonomic databases, but his overall impact on the field is evident through the enduring use of his nomenclature. \n\nIn summary, Pandelle was a key figure in late 19th-century entomology, with a focus on Diptera taxonomy. His work on *Delia*, *Blaesoxipha*, *Sarcophaga*, and other genera provided critical classifications, though some records require reconciliation to clarify publication timelines. His scientific rigor and breadth of contributions underscore his significance in the study of insect biodiversity.

The species is distributed across two distinct geographic regions: Menyuan in Qinghai Province, China, and the Pyrenees mountain range in Europe. These locations suggest a possible disjunct distribution pattern, which may reflect historical biogeographic events or ecological adaptability. While the first description notes \"\"unspecified but related morphological features,\"\" the second provides specific details, indicating that the species’ defining traits include the yellow basal scales and its moderate size. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as the latter elaborates on the former. Delia interflua is thus recognized as a 6.5 mm-long fly with yellow basal scales, documented in both East Asia and Europe, and formally classified under the genus *Delia* by Pandelle. Its presence in Qinghai and the Pyrenees highlights its range across diverse ecosystems, though further research may be needed to clarify its ecological preferences or life history traits.
