The genus was established by the entomologist **Malloch in 1921**, marking its formal recognition in taxonomic literature. As a member of the Phaoniini tribe, **Dichaetomyia** is classified under the broader family of flies that includes various species with ecological and biological significance. The descriptions provided consistently align on its taxonomic placement and the year of its establishment, with no contradictory information to resolve. The genus is notable for its inclusion in the Phaoniinae subfamily, a group characterized by specific morphological and behavioral traits typical of certain fly species. **Dichaetomyia** remains a key entity in entomological studies, reflecting Malloch’s foundational work in the early 20th century.\",4\n2940,PHAONIINI,\"\n\n**PHAONIINI** is a taxonomic tribe within the subfamily Phaoniinae, a group of flies (Diptera) characterized by their inclusion of the genera *Dichaetomyia* and *Brontaea*. The tribe is recognized as part of the broader classification of the family Muscidae, though specific familial context is not explicitly detailed in the provided data. *Dichaetomyia*, a key genus within PHAONIINI, is highlighted in both descriptions, underscoring its central role in defining the tribe. Additionally, the tribe encompasses species from the genus *Brontaea*, which further diversifies its taxonomic composition. PHAONIINI is thus distinguished by its dual representation of these genera, reflecting its significance in the study of phaoniine flies. The descriptions align in identifying the tribe’s primary constituents, with no contradictions requiring resolution.

The descriptions provided confirm that Dichaetomyia is classified under the Phaoniini tribe, with both statements emphasizing the same taxonomic relationship. While the first description refers to \"\"the Phaoniini tribe\"\" and the second to \"\"tribe Phaoniini,\"\" these are equivalent in meaning, differing only in phrasing. The Phaoniini tribe is known for its diverse species of muscoid flies, many of which are associated with decaying organic matter or specific ecological niches. Dichaetomyia, as a member of this tribe, shares these general characteristics but is distinguished by its own morphological and genetic traits. The genus is part of a broader classification system that organizes flies into tribes, genera, and species to reflect evolutionary and ecological relationships. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they both consistently place Dichaetomyia within the Phaoniini tribe. This alignment underscores the importance of standardized taxonomic terminology in biological classification. The Phaoniini tribe itself is a well-defined group, and Dichaetomyia’s inclusion within it highlights its phylogenetic ties to other genera in the same tribe. Further details about Dichaetomyia’s specific species, habitats, or behaviors are not included in the provided data, but its tribal classification remains a key identifier.
