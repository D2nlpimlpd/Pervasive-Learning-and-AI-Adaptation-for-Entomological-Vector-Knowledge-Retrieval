It serves as a key platform for the description of new species and the documentation of distribution records, particularly for dipteran (fly) genera such as *Phaonia*, *Sinohylemya*, and *Phorbia*. The journal has a long-standing reputation for contributing to both domestic and international entomological research.  \n\nNotable species described or published in *动物分类学报* include *Blaesoxipha subunicolor*, *范氏细麻蝇* (Fan’s fine fly), *Hydrotaea monochaeta* (described by Ma and Wu in 1986), and *Phaonia maculobambusa*, *Phaonia brunneipalpis*, *Phaonia yanggaoensis*, and *Phaonia dawushanensis*. It has also featured studies on *Sinohylemya craspedodonta*, *Phorbia asiatica*, and *Phallosphaera amica*, as well as the genus *Helina*. Specific examples of its publications include a study in volume 6(2), pages 184–185, and other works on species like *曲股欧麻蝇* (European tachinid fly with curved femur) and *贺兰山欧麻蝇* (Hulanshan European tachinid fly).  \n\nThe journal emphasizes rigorous taxonomic analysis, often incorporating morphological, ecological, and geographic data to support species identification and classification. Its contributions extend beyond China, with records of species distribution spanning multiple regions. Researchers associated with the journal have included domestic scholars such as Ma and Wu, who described *Hydrotaea monochaeta*, and others who have documented the biodiversity of flies and related taxa.  \n\n*动物分类学报* plays a critical role in advancing the understanding of animal taxonomy, particularly for understudied or newly discovered species. By consolidating descriptions of diverse genera and species, it provides a comprehensive resource for entomologists and taxonomists. The journal’s bilingual approach—publishing both Chinese and English titles—enhances its accessibility to international audiences while maintaining its focus on Chinese biodiversity.  \n\nIn summary, *动物分类学报* is a vital Chinese publication for zoological taxonomy, recognized for its detailed species descriptions, distribution records, and contributions to the classification of dipteran and other animal taxa. Its work supports global and regional taxonomic databases, reflecting the journal’s commitment to scientific accuracy and biodiversity research.

It serves as the type locality for *Phaonia halterata*, a species of fly first described and cataloged in this area, highlighting its importance in entomological research. Additionally, Hokkaido is associated with the distribution of *Tricycleopsis paradoxa*, a plant species whose presence in the region underscores the area's ecological uniqueness. These two species, though distinct in their biological classifications, both reflect Hokkaido's status as a key location for scientific discovery and conservation. The region's cold-temperate climate, expansive forests, and alpine environments contribute to its rich natural heritage, supporting a variety of flora and fauna that are either endemic or uniquely adapted to its conditions. Hokkaido's role as a type locality for *Phaonia halterata* indicates that it was the site where the species was originally identified and named, providing a foundational reference for subsequent studies. Meanwhile, the association with *Tricycleopsis paradoxa* suggests that the plant's habitat range or ecological niche is closely tied to Hokkaido's specific environmental characteristics. Together, these examples illustrate the region's significance in both zoological and botanical research, emphasizing its value as a living laboratory for understanding species adaptation and distribution patterns. The descriptions provided are consistent in identifying Hokkaido as a Japanese region central to the study of these two species, with no contradictions to resolve. Its natural landscapes, including mountains, wetlands, and coastal areas, likely support the habitats required for both *Phaonia halterata* and *Tricycleopsis paradoxa*, further cementing its role in ecological and taxonomic investigations.\",1\n3384,本州长野县,Nagano Prefecture (Honshu) is a Japanese location associated with the type locality of Phaonia halterata.,1\n3385,远东,\"\n\nThe Far East (远东) is a region within the Soviet Union historically associated with the distribution of several species, including the Tricycleopsis paradoxa and Phaonia halterata (贝加尔欧麻蝇). This area, characterized by its vast and ecologically diverse landscapes, served as a critical habitat for these organisms. The Tricycleopsis paradoxa, a species of interest in entomological studies, is documented as being present in the Far East, highlighting the region’s role in supporting its ecological range. Similarly, the Far East is linked to the distribution of Phaonia halterata, a fly species noted for its presence in this part of the USSR. The third description specifies that the Far East functions as the \"\"foreign distribution area\"\" (国外分布地) for Phaonia halterata, suggesting that while the species is native to the Soviet Union, its occurrence in the Far East may represent an extension or distinct population within the country’s borders. \n\nThese references collectively underscore the Far East’s significance as a biodiversity hotspot in the Soviet Union, particularly for species with specialized or geographically restricted habitats. The region’s unique environmental conditions, such as its cold climates, dense forests, and proximity to East Asia, likely contributed to the presence of these species. However, the term \"\"foreign distribution\"\" in the third description may imply that Phaonia halterata’s presence in the Far East was either less common compared to other Soviet regions or part of a broader transboundary ecological context. This could indicate that the Far East acted as a transitional or peripheral zone for the species, aligning with its geographical position as a bridge between the Soviet Union and neighboring countries. \n\nNo direct contradictions exist among the descriptions, as they all affirm the Far East’s role in the distribution of the mentioned species. The summary integrates the information to emphasize the region’s ecological importance and its connection to both Tricycleopsis paradoxa and Phaonia halterata, while clarifying the nuanced meaning of \"\"foreign distribution\"\" in the context of the Soviet Union. The Far East, therefore, is not only a geographical entity but also a key area for understanding the biogeographical patterns of these species within the USSR. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",1\n4709,建昌,City in Liaoning Province where Blaesoxipha subunicolor is distributed,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1051,动物分类学报,HEILONGJIANG,动物分类学报 documents species distributed in Heilongjiang,244\n6473,MA ET AL.,LIAONING,\"Phaonia iwurhuishanensis, described by Ma et al., is found in Liaoning\",228\n6483,XUE ET FENG,SICHUAN,\"Phaonia bruneaurea, described by Xue et Feng, is found in Sichuan\",188\n1047,HSUC,动物分类学报,Hsuc described the genus Sinohylemya in 动物分类学报,49\n6106,动物分类学报,HSUE ET WANG,Hsue et Wang published the description of Phaonia maculobambusa in 动物分类学报,49\n6113,动物分类学报,北海道,动物分类学报 documents the type locality of Phaonia halterata in Hokkaido,49\n6114,动物分类学报,本州长野县,动物分类学报 references the type locality of Phaonia halterata in Nagano Prefecture,49\n6116,动物分类学报,远东,动物分类学报 documents the distribution of Phaonia halterata in the Soviet Union's Far East,49\n8906,动物分类学报,建昌,The journal 动物分类学报 documents Blaesoxipha subunicolor distribution in Jianchang,49\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
