Located in the Xizang (Tibet) region, it is explicitly noted as the type locality for several species and subspecies, including the 1353 Lhasa Pierretia Fly, the subspecies *Morellia hortorum tibetana*, and *Calythea xizangensis*. These designations highlight Lhasa’s role as a critical site for the initial discovery and formal description of these organisms. Additionally, Lhasa is referenced in the taxonomic key for *Sarcophagini*, a family of flies, further underscoring its importance in the classification of insect species. The city is also associated with the distribution of *Mesembrina meridiana nudiparafacia*, a subspecies of the *Mesembrina meridiana* fly, indicating its ecological relevance as a habitat for this species. While the descriptions emphasize Lhasa’s entomological significance, they collectively affirm its identity as the administrative and cultural center of Tibet. The repeated mention of \"\"type locality\"\" across multiple species suggests that Lhasa is a well-documented location in scientific literature for biodiversity studies, particularly in the field of dipteran taxonomy. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions align with Lhasa’s status as a capital city and its role in the taxonomic records of these specific species.
