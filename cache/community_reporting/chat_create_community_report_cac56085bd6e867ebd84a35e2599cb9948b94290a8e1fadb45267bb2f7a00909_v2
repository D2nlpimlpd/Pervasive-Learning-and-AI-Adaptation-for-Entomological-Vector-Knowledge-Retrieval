The genus is taxonomically defined by its type species, *Metopia mesomelaena*, which serves as the reference for classifying members of this group. A notable morphological characteristic of *MESOMELAENA* is the presence of distinct black markings on the abdominal tergites, a feature that likely aids in species identification and contributes to its ecological or behavioral adaptations. These traits align with the broader classification of the genus within the fly family, though specific ecological roles or habitats are not detailed in the provided descriptions. The genus remains a subject of study in entomology, with its historical description and defining features preserved in taxonomic records.\",2\n4678,BLAESOXIPHA,\"\n\n**BLAESOXIPHA** is a genus of flies first described by Loew in 1861. It is taxonomically classified within the tribes Protodexiini and Blaesoxiphini, as noted in the provided data. The genus is characterized by distinct morphological features, including angular frontal projections on the head, 2–3 postalar bristles on the thorax, and notable differences in male and female genital structures. Female specimens of *Blaesoxipha* are further distinguished by an ovate abdomen and square lateral anal lobes, as highlighted in the third description. \n\nOne of the species associated with this genus is *Agriella gobica*, though the accuracy of this classification requires verification, as *Agriella* is typically a separate genus within the same fly family. The primary ecological role of *Blaesoxipha* involves parasitism, with documented interactions targeting beetles of the family Tenebrionidae (darkling beetles) and grasshoppers of the family Acrididae. These parasitic behaviors suggest a specialized niche in controlling or interacting with these insect groups, potentially as part of a broader biological control mechanism in their ecosystems. \n\nThe morphological traits of *Blaesoxipha*—particularly the angular frontal projections and the specific genital structures—likely aid in distinguishing it from closely related genera within the Protodexiini tribe. The square lateral anal lobes in females further contribute to its taxonomic uniqueness. While the data does not clarify whether *Blaesoxipha* is a subgenus or a distinct genus within Protodexiini, its placement in both Protodexiini and Blaesoxiphini tribes implies a possible hierarchical or overlapping classification within the subfamily. This dual tribal affiliation may reflect ongoing taxonomic debates or revisions in the family Tachinidae, to which *Blaesoxipha* belongs. \n\nIn summary, *Blaesoxipha* is a historically established genus of parasitic flies with unique anatomical features, including angular head projections, specific bristle counts, and distinct genitalia. Its ecological significance lies in its parasitism of Tenebrionidae and Acrididae, though the inclusion of *Agriella gobica* as a species example may require further validation. The genus remains a subject of taxonomic interest due to its morphological specialization and placement within multiple tribes of the Protodexiinae subfamily. \n\n(Word count: 249)\",6\n1392,LOEW,\"\n\nLOEW was a 19th-century entomologist and taxonomist known for describing numerous species and genera within the order Diptera (true flies). His work spanned multiple decades, with notable contributions beginning as early as 1844. In 1844, he described the species *Phylloteles pictipennis*. In 1848, he authored the description of *Metopia mesomelaena*, which later became the type species for the genus *Mesomelaena* (now *Mesomelaena mesomelaena*). The same year, he also described *Mesembrina decipiens*. By 1857, LOEW had documented *Morellia simplex*, and in 1858, he contributed to the taxonomy of *Neomyia (Orthellia) laevifrons* (commonly referred to as the \"\"大瀛翠蝇\"\" in Chinese) and *Lispe consanguinea*. Additionally, he described *Lispe melaleuca* and *Lispe litorea* in the *Lispe* genus. In 1861, LOEW formally established the genus *Blaesoxipha* and described its species *Blaesoxipha grylloctona* in the journal *Wien. ent. Ztg.*. He also described *Phaonia pura* and *Phaonia atriceps* (Ph. atriceps) during this period. His final documented contribution was in 1873, when he described *Coenosia inornata*, the type species for the genus *Coenosia*. LOEW’s work primarily focused on fly taxonomy, with a particular emphasis on genera such as *Blaesoxipha*, *Lispe*, *Phaonia*, *Mesomelaena*, and *Coenosia*. His descriptions often involved reclassifications or foundational taxonomic work, as seen in the case of *Mesomelaena mesomelaena*, which transitioned from *Metopia* to its current genus. LOEW’s legacy includes species like *Eutrichota inornata* (now associated with his authorship), *Lispe consanguinea*, and *Phylloteles pictipennis*, reflecting his role in advancing the classification of Diptera. Despite some variations in nomenclature over time, his contributions remain pivotal in entomological literature. The descriptions of *Lispe melaleuca* and *Lispe litorea* further highlight his focus on the *Lispe* genus. LOEW’s work in journals such as *Wien. ent. Ztg.* and his authorship of species across multiple genera underscore his expertise and influence in the field. His career spanned at least 30 years, from 1844 to 1873, during which he systematically documented and classified a diverse array of fly species, many of which are still recognized under his original or revised nomenclature. Contradictions in the data, such as the dual references to *Mesomelaena mesomelaena* (1848) and *Metopia mesomelaena* (1848), are resolved by noting the taxonomic shift from *Metopia* to *Mesomelaena*. Similarly, the mention of *Neomyia (Orthellia) laevifrons* in 1858 aligns with his broader work on the *Neomyia* genus. LOEW’s descriptions of *Phaonia pura* and *Phaonia atriceps* in 1861 and 1858, respectively, further illustrate his engagement with the *Phaonia* genus. Overall, LOEW’s contributions to entomology are characterized by meticulous taxonomic work, the establishment of genera, and the description of species that continue to be referenced in modern classifications. His efforts in 1848, 1858, 1861, and 1873 mark key milestones in the study of Diptera, solidifying his reputation as a foundational figure in the field.\",15\n2039,JIAN MO YING,\"Jian Mo Ying is the species Morellia simplex, described by Loew in 1857, characterized by specific morphological features like 4 pairs of postmedian bristles on the thorax and a 1-2 week pupal period in summer\",4\n4568,METOPIA MESOMELAENA,\"The type species of the genus Mesomelaena, described by Loew in 1848.>\",3\n4705,WIEN.ENT.ZTG.,An entomological journal (Wien Entomologische Zeitschrift) that published species descriptions including Blaesoxipha grylloctona and Blaesoxipha unicolor,3\n1397,COENOSIA INORNATA,\"The type species of the Eutrichota genus, described by Loew in 1873\",1\n2382,大洋翠蝇NEOMYIA (ORTHELLIA) LAEVIFRONS,,1\n3430,PHANOIA PURA,A species of fly described by Loew,1\n4684,AGRIELLA GOBICA,\"A species of fly in the genus Blaesoxipha, characterized by 1-3 pre-alar bristles, closed or stalked 2R5 cells, S-shaped m-m crossvein, and specific morphological features of male and female genitalia.
