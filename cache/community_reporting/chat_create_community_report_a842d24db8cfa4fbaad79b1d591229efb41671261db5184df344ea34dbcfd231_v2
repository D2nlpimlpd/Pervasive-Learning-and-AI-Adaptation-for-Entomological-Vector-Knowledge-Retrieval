Additionally, Wang Shuyong is linked to the study of *Meigenia grandigena*, another entomological subject, further highlighting his involvement in documenting or analyzing insect biodiversity in Beijing. While the descriptions do not specify the exact nature of his role in the study of *Meigenia grandigena* (e.g., whether he conducted fieldwork, taxonomic analysis, or collaborative research), they collectively establish his engagement with entomological work in the area. The lack of direct contradiction between the two descriptions allows for a unified summary, emphasizing his contributions to the documentation of at least two distinct species within the same geographic context. His activities likely support broader scientific efforts to catalog and understand insect populations in Beijing, though further details about his methodologies, affiliations, or the scope of his research remain unspecified in the provided data.\",3\n5536,ZHOU SHIXIU,Zhou Shixiu is an individual associated with the study of Meigenia grandigena in Beijing.,2\n4099,STEJN,Stejn is a researcher associated with the subspecies Passer montanus saturatue in Beijing,1\n1505,PEGOMYA ORIENTIS,\"Fly species described by Suwa in 1974, found in Shanghai and Zhejiang\",4\n5485,1431家蚕追寄蝇,,18\n5507,TACHINA NOCTUARUM,A species of fly described by Rondani in 1865,11\n1066,LEUCOPHORA UNILINEATA,\"Leucophora unilineata is a species of fly described by Zetterstedt in 1920, characterized by specific morphological features such as wing bristles and body length of 6-7 mm\",7\n1464,PEGOMYA CUNICULARIA,\"A species of Pegomya fly in the Pegomya hyoscyami group with no pre-dorsal bristles on the fore tibia, yellow or brownish lower mouthparts, and dark-tipped antennae.
