It is home to a wide array of taxa, including **Atherigona reversura**, **Atherigona triglomerata**, and **Muscina species**, with specific records from Tianmu Mountain and other locations. The province hosts several notable genera such as **Parasarcophaga**, **Pegomya**, **Gonia**, **Carcelia**, **Brontaea**, **Stomorhina**, **Timavia**, **Vibrissina Rondani**, **Bessa**, and **Fucellia apicalis**, alongside species like **Eutrichota gigas** (type locality: Tianmu Mountain), **Frontina laeta**, **Musca autumnalis**, **Musca convexifrons** (Tianmu Mountain), **Thecocarcelia parnarae**, **Thecocarcelia laticornis**, **Argyrophylax phoeda**, **Argyrophylax nigrotibialis**, **Compsilura concinnata**, **Dinemomyia nigribasicosta**, **Rhyncomya setipyga**, **Thick Ring Black Fly** (Tianmu Mountain, Beiyandangshan), **I. tripartita**, and **Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis**. \n\nZhejiang is particularly associated with **Tianmu Mountain** as a key site for multiple species, including **Syngamoptera chekiangensis** (type locality), **Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri**, **Achoetandrus rufifacies**, **1430筒须新怯寄蝇** (New Genus of Fly), **1431家蚕追寄蝇** (Bombyx Silkworm Fly), **Semi-transparent Fly** (半透璃蝇), **Brown-tailed Bristle Fly** (棕尾别麻蝇), **Tiger Claw Bristle Fly**, **Bing’s Bristle Fly**, and **Yiwu Bristle Fly**. Other localities within the province, such as **Hangzhou**, **Jiangshan**, **Moganshan**, **Yiwu**, and **Zhoushan**, are also highlighted for their biodiversity. For example, **Moganshan** is noted for **Meigenia grandigena**, while **Hangzhou** is linked to **Graphomya rufitibia**, **Calliphora axata**, and **Muscidae subfamilies**. \n\nThe province supports diverse ecological interactions, including species associated with agricultural pests like the **Rice Borer** and **Rice Leafroller Moth**. Zhejiang’s fauna includes **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Parasarcophaga brevicornis**, **Parasarcophaga macroauriculata**, and **Parasarcophaga polystylata**, as well as **Sarcophaga species**, **Leucophora hangzhouensis**, **Haematobia**, and **Nupedia fulva**. The **Pegomya** genus is well-represented, with species such as **Pegomya spinulosa**, **Pegomya phyllostachys**, **Pegomya pachura**, **Pegomya clavellata**, and **Pegomya japonica mokanensis**. Additionally, **Gonia klapperichi**, **Gonia chinensis**, **Gonia bimaculata**, and **Bengalia species** are documented in Zhejiang, alongside **Miltogramma iberium** and **Exorista larvarum**. \n\nZhejiang’s role as a type locality is emphasized for **1393义乌亚麻蝇** (Yiwu Bristle Fly) and **Syngamoptera chekiangensis**, underscoring its importance in entomological research. The province also records **Brontaea tonitrui**, **Actia nigroscutellata**, **Bellardia menechmoides** (Beiyeyangdangshan), **Dasychira baibaran**, **Enneastigma shanghaiensis**, and **Servillia ardens**. Notably, **Tachina nupta** and **Tachina noctuarum** are found here, as are **1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly** and **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**. \n\nIn summary, Zhejiang is a critical hub for fly biodiversity in China, characterized by its varied habitats and the presence of both common and specialized species. Key locations like Tianmu Mountain, Hangzhou, and Yiwu serve as focal points for entomological studies, while the province’s ecological diversity supports interactions with agricultural pests and hosts a range of genera and species with scientific and local significance.

Zhejiang, located in eastern China, is known for its diverse ecosystems and agricultural significance, particularly in rice cultivation. HE JUNHUA’s connection to the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens suggests involvement in biological or ecological research, potentially related to plant or insect species native to the region. These specimens may represent a specific group of organisms or a research project focused on biodiversity, conservation, or agricultural pests.  \n\nAdditionally, HE JUNHUA’s association with the Rice Leafroller Moth in Zhejiang highlights their role in addressing a critical agricultural pest that threatens rice crops. The Rice Leafroller Moth is a significant insect in rice-growing areas, as its larvae feed on rice leaves, causing damage that reduces yields. Research on this species in Zhejiang likely centers on monitoring its population, understanding its life cycle, or developing pest management strategies to mitigate its impact on local agriculture. This work aligns with broader efforts in the province to sustain rice production, a staple of Zhejiang’s economy and food security.  \n\nWhile the descriptions do not explicitly clarify the relationship between the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens and the Rice Leafroller Moth, both associations underscore HE JUNHUA’s engagement with Zhejiang’s ecological and agricultural systems. The lack of direct overlap between the two topics implies that HE JUNHUA may contribute to multiple areas of study within the region, such as biodiversity documentation and pest control. Zhejiang’s role as a hub for both natural and agricultural research further contextualizes these associations, as the province supports initiatives to balance ecological preservation with sustainable farming practices.  \n\nIn summary, HE JUNHUA is linked to Zhejiang through their work on the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens and the Rice Leafroller Moth, reflecting a dual focus on regional biodiversity and agricultural challenges. Their contributions likely support scientific understanding and practical solutions for Zhejiang’s ecosystems and rice industry, though the exact nature of their research on the specimens remains unspecified.
