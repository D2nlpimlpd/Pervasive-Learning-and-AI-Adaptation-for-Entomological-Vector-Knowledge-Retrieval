The province’s cities, including Zhangbei, Beijing, and Shanhaiguan, are mentioned in relation to species like *Phormia regina*.  \n\nHebei’s role as a hub for fly biodiversity is underscored by its inclusion in distribution records for genera like *Anthomyia* (*Anthomyia illocata*, *Anthomyia imbrida*), *Miltogramma*, and *Parasarcophaga*, as well as species such as *Musca sorbens* (秋家蝇) and *马粪碧蝇*. The province’s varied ecosystems support a wide array of species, from the *THICK RING BLACK FLY* to *1339上海细麻蝇*, with some entries emphasizing its status as a \"\"domestic region in China with multiple species distributions.\"\" Despite the diversity of species and studies, all descriptions consistently identify Hebei as a key location for fly ecology and research, particularly in the context of historical entomological work and regional biodiversity. The summary integrates all provided data, resolving minor redundancies while maintaining clarity and coherence.\",99\n581,BEIJING,\"\n\nBeijing, the capital city of China and a municipality within the country, serves as a significant hub for the distribution of numerous fly species and genera. It is associated with a wide array of taxa, including both native and documented species. Among the notable genera found in Beijing are **Adia**, **Bactromyia**, **Bercaea**, **Blondelia**, **Calythea**, **Carcelia** (with *Carcelia matsukarehae*, *Carcelia ambigua*, and *Carcelia lymantriae*), **Cuphocera**, **Delia**, **Eumetopiella**, **Exorista**, **Gonia** (including *Gonia chinensis*, *Gonia bimaculata*, and *Gonia picea*), **Heteronychia**, **Hydrotaea**, **Lasiomma**, **Lispe** (*Lispe monochaita* and *Lispe melaleuca*), **Muscina**, **Musca** (*Musca autumnalis*, *Musca bezzii*, *Musca conducens*, and *Musca tempestiva*), **Nemoraea**, **Paradichosia**, **Parasarcophaga** (*Parasarcophaga polystylata* and *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata*), **Pegomya**, **Polleniopsis**, **Prosena**, **Robineauella**, **Siphona**, **Tachina** (*Tachina noctuarum* and *Tachina nupta*), and **Winthemia**. Specific species documented in Beijing include *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Compsilura concinnata*, *Heteronychia quoi*, *Macronychia polyodon*, *Bellardia benshiensis*, *Bellardia menechma*, *Blondelia nigripes*, *Craspedoeta* spp., *Eumetopiella (lntermedia) luridimacula* (found in Baohua Mountain), *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (in Wofosi and Yanqing), *Graphomya rufitibia*, *Hyleorus elatus*, *Paradichosia scutellata*, *Phormia regina*, *Phylloteles stackelbergi*, *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Prosena* spp., and *Zaira* spp. Additionally, Beijing is the type locality for the genus *Hoa* and the species *Calliphora sinensis*, as well as a domestic distribution site for *Calliphora vicina* (Red-headed Calliphora) and *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*. The region also hosts *Meigenia grandigena*, *Meigenia majuscula*, and *Medina collaris*, alongside the *1431家蚕追寄蝇* (domestic silkworm tachinid fly) and *614裸蹠芒蝇* (naked tarsal芒蝇). Beijing is further linked to the distribution of *1256黑须污蝇* (black-haired dirty fly), *圆斑莠蝇* (circular-spotted fly), and *THICK RING BLACK FLY*. The municipality supports the larvae of *Protocalliphora azurea* in sparrow nests and is home to the *Brush Spring Fly*. Notably, Beijing overlaps with Hebei province in some references, but as a municipality, it is distinct. The data collectively highlight Beijing’s ecological role as a shared distribution location for multiple fly species, including both common and regionally specific taxa, with records spanning genera, species, and localized observations. This underscores its importance in entomological studies within China.

Notably, he is recognized as a collector who documented the species *Heteronychia quoi*, contributing to the understanding of its distribution or characteristics in the region. Additionally, Wang Shuyong is linked to the study of *Meigenia grandigena*, another entomological subject, further highlighting his involvement in documenting or analyzing insect biodiversity in Beijing. While the descriptions do not specify the exact nature of his role in the study of *Meigenia grandigena* (e.g., whether he conducted fieldwork, taxonomic analysis, or collaborative research), they collectively establish his engagement with entomological work in the area. The lack of direct contradiction between the two descriptions allows for a unified summary, emphasizing his contributions to the documentation of at least two distinct species within the same geographic context. His activities likely support broader scientific efforts to catalog and understand insect populations in Beijing, though further details about his methodologies, affiliations, or the scope of his research remain unspecified in the provided data.\",3\n5536,ZHOU SHIXIU,Zhou Shixiu is an individual associated with the study of Meigenia grandigena in Beijing.,2\n4099,STEJN,Stejn is a researcher associated with the subspecies Passer montanus saturatue in Beijing,1\n1505,PEGOMYA ORIENTIS,\"Fly species described by Suwa in 1974, found in Shanghai and Zhejiang\",4\n5485,1431家蚕追寄蝇,,18\n5507,TACHINA NOCTUARUM,A species of fly described by Rondani in 1865,11\n1066,LEUCOPHORA UNILINEATA,\"Leucophora unilineata is a species of fly described by Zetterstedt in 1920, characterized by specific morphological features such as wing bristles and body length of 6-7 mm\",7\n1464,PEGOMYA CUNICULARIA,\"A species of Pegomya fly in the Pegomya hyoscyami group with no pre-dorsal bristles on the fore tibia, yellow or brownish lower mouthparts, and dark-tipped antennae.

The region’s cities, such as Baise, Chongzuo, and Lingye, are noted for their ecological significance in supporting these species. While some descriptions refer to Guangxi as a \"\"province,\"\" it is technically an autonomous region within China, a distinction that aligns with its administrative classification. The data collectively emphasize Guangxi as a critical area for the study and conservation of various fly and parasitic wasp species, with specific localities and genera contributing to its entomological importance.
