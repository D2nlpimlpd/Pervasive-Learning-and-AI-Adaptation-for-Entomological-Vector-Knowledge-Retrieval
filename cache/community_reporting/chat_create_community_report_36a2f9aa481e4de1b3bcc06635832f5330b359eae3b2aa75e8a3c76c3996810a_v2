It has documented numerous species across diverse fly families, including parasitic flies, and is recognized for its contributions to entomological science in China. The journal has published descriptions of species such as *Egle rectapica* and *Egle cyrtapica*, as well as *Protomiltogramma yunnanense* (described in issue 24(3):314, figures 5–10, under the genus *Pterella*). It has also featured studies on parasitic flies like *Blepharipa tibialis* and *Drymeia xinjiangensis*, alongside *Xestomyia hirtifemur*. \n\nTaxonomic work on the genus *Pegomya* is prominently highlighted, with the journal publishing descriptions of *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Pegomya hamatacrophalla*, *Pegomya angusticerca*, *Pegomya simpliciforceps*, *Pegomya flaviprecoxa*, *Pegomya dichaetomyiola*, *Pegomya folifera*, *Pegomya melatrochanter*, *Pegomya crinisternita*, and *Pegomya tenuiramula*. For the genus *Phaonia*, it has documented species such as *Phaonia bitrigona*, *Phaonia nigrigenis*, *Phaonia qingheensis*, and *Phaonia fissa*, with specific mentions of *Phaonia huanrenensis* described in 1984. The journal also includes studies on *Bellardia* species, such as *Bellardia micromenechma* and *Bellardia notomenechma* (described in 1986 by Liang and Gan), and *Servillia planiforceps*. \n\nAdditional species documented in the journal include *Heteronychia macromembrana* (1980), *Syllegopterula flava* (with a reference correction to remove an extraneous parenthesis), *Dinemomyia nigribasicosta* (described by Chen in 1975), and *1355 Small Gray Pierretia Fly*. It has also published works on *Alliopsis* species, *1278靴折麻蝇* (Servaisia species in issue 21(2):185), and *1966 study on fly larvae* by Meng Xianqin. The journal’s 1981 issue (volume 24, issue 3, pages 314–315) includes the description of *Tibetan Tuberomembrana*, and it has been a venue for documenting new *Helina* species and their Chinese distributions. \n\nThe journal is written in Chinese (its full title is *昆虫学报*) and has been cited in multiple contexts, including taxonomic classifications and ecological research. Its publications span decades, with notable contributions in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and it continues to serve as a critical resource for entomologists studying Chinese insect biodiversity. The journal’s role in describing and classifying species like *Burmanomyia beesoni* and *Atherigona* (e.g., pages 4(1–2):8–9, figures 1–5, 6–10, 21–26, 32–36) further underscores its importance in regional entomology. \n\nIn summary, *Acta Entomologica Sinica* is a multidisciplinary Chinese journal that has systematically advanced the understanding of fly taxonomy, ecology, and distribution, with a focus on species native to China. It has been instrumental in publishing works by researchers such as Liang, Gan, Hsue, and Chen, and remains a foundational reference for studies on genera like *Pegomya*, *Phaonia*, *Bellardia*, and others. The journal’s historical and ongoing contributions to entomology are marked by detailed morphological descriptions, distribution data, and taxonomic revisions, making it a vital resource for the scientific community. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",66\n1373,ALLIOPSIS LATIFRONS,\"Species described by Fan et Wu in 1983, found in Tibet\",2\n1374,ALLIOPSIS HETEROCHAETA,\"Species described by Fan et Wu in 1983, found in Tibet\",2\n1375,ALLIOPSIS DENTILAMELLA,\"Species described by Fan et Wu in 1983, found in Tibet\",2\n1376,ALLIOPSIS VENTIPALMATA,\"Species described by Fan et Wu in 1983, found in Tibet\",2\n6211,MENG XIANQIN,Author of a 1966 article in Acta Entomologica Sinica about fly larvae,1\n2576,ATHERIGONA ORBICULARIS,\"A species of fly with a three-leaf-like structure resembling a pear shape, 2.5-3 mm body length.

In 1947, GAN independently described the species *Rhinoestrus latifrons*, contributing to the classification of this organism. Decades later, in 1958, GAN was linked to the study of *Achoetandrus rufifacies* in Anhui, China, though the specific role in this research (e.g., co-authorship or primary authorship) is not explicitly detailed.  \n\nGAN’s most notable collaborative work occurred in 1986, when they co-authored the taxonomic descriptions of three species within the genus *Bellardia*. These include *Bellardia micromenechma*, *Bellardia notomenechma*, and *Bellardia curviloba*, the latter of which was described jointly with Liang. The 1986 publications highlight GAN’s expertise in entomology or a related field, as these species likely belong to a group of insects or arthropods. While the first two species (*micromenechma* and *notomenechma*) are attributed to GAN as a co-author without specifying additional collaborators, the third (*curviloba*) explicitly names Liang as a co-author, suggesting GAN may have worked with multiple researchers during this period.  \n\nThe data indicates GAN’s contributions span at least four decades (1947–1986), with a focus on taxonomic research. Their work on *Bellardia* species in 1986 appears to be a concentrated effort, possibly part of a broader study on the genus. The 1958 association with *Achoetandrus rufifacies* in Anhui further underscores their involvement in regional biodiversity documentation. However, the lack of explicit co-authorship details for the 1947 and 1958 entries, compared to the 1986 descriptions, may reflect differences in publication practices or the nature of their contributions (e.g., primary authorship vs. collaborative work).  \n\nIn summary, GAN is recognized for describing *Rhinoestrus latifrons* (1947), studying *Achoetandrus rufifacies* in Anhui (1958), and co-authoring the 1986 descriptions of three *Bellardia* species, including *curviloba* with Liang. These contributions demonstrate a long-standing engagement with taxonomic science, particularly in the classification of arthropods or related organisms. The consistency in the entity name \"\"GAN\"\" across all descriptions supports the conclusion that these works are attributed to a single individual, despite the temporal and taxonomic diversity of the studies.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",4\n1880,POGONOMYIA,\"\n\n**POGONOMYIA** is a taxonomic genus of flies that has been documented in entomological literature and scientific journals. It is primarily associated with the family Tephritidae, a group of acalyptrate flies commonly known as fruit flies or picture-winged flies. The genus is noted for its taxonomic relationship to other fly genera, including **Drymeia** and **Xestomyia**, which are either closely related or share a common classification within the broader context of Diptera (true flies). \n\nIn entomological studies, **POGONOMYIA** is referenced as a distinct group, though its specific ecological or morphological characteristics are not detailed in the provided descriptions. The genus appears to be part of a larger taxonomic framework that includes **Drymeia** and **Xestomyia**, suggesting shared evolutionary traits or habitat preferences. These associations are highlighted in scientific discussions, where **POGONOMYIA** is often mentioned alongside these genera to clarify phylogenetic connections or classification debates. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize that **POGONOMYIA** is a recognized entity in entomological research, with its relevance extending to comparative studies involving **Drymeia** and **Xestomyia**. While the exact number of species within **POGONOMYIA** or their geographic distribution is not specified, the genus is acknowledged as a subject of academic interest, contributing to the understanding of fly taxonomy and biodiversity. \n\nNo direct contradictions exist among the descriptions, as all consistently identify **POGONOMYIA** as a fly genus and note its taxonomic ties to **Drymeia** and **Xestomyia**. The summary integrates these points to present a unified account of the entity’s classification and scientific context. (Word count: 150)\",13\n1874,DRYMEIA ACULEATA,\"A species of fly (Drymeia aculeata) referenced in the text, likely characterized by a spur-like structure on the hind tibia.>\",1\n2487,ATHERIGONA,\"\n\n**ATHERIGONA** is a genus of flies belonging to the subfamily Atherigoninae within the family Muscidae. First described by Rondani, the genus is characterized by distinct morphological features in both adult and larval stages. Adult Atherigona species typically exhibit short preapical dorsocentral bristles, a key taxonomic trait, and possess setae (bristles) on the anterior femur of their legs. These features help distinguish the genus from related groups within the Muscidae family. \n\nThe larvae of Atherigona are notable for their short, blunt projections and kidney-shaped or oval posterior spiracles, which are critical for respiration and further aid in identification. These larval characteristics align with the broader ecological and developmental patterns observed in muscid flies, though Atherigona's specific traits set it apart. \n\nThe genus is taxonomically diverse, with recognized subgenera such as *Acritochaeta*. This subgeneric classification reflects the evolutionary and morphological variability within Atherigona, though the exact number and relationships of subgenera may require further study. \n\nIn summary, Atherigona is a well-defined genus within the Muscidae family, distinguished by adult morphological markers like short dorsocentral bristles and setae on the anterior femur, as well as unique larval features including blunt projections and specific spiracle shapes. Its subgeneric structure, exemplified by *Acritochaeta*, highlights the complexity of its classification. The genus remains an important subject in entomological research due to its ecological roles and taxonomic distinctiveness. \n\n(Word count: 150)\",11\n2577,ATHERIGONA SCOPLA,\"A species of fly with a three-leaf-like structure having a broad梨形 side leaf, 3 mm body length. Found in Guangdong (Taishan, type locality).\",2\n2578,ATHERIGONA LATIBASIS,\"A species of fly with a three-leaf-like structure having a wide triangular base, 3.5 mm body length. Found in Guangdong (Taishan, type locality).\",2\n2489,WILLCOCKS,Willcocks is a researcher who studied the Atherigona genus in 1925,1\n2527,TAISHAN,\"\n\n**TAISHAN** is a location in China that has been referenced in multiple entomological studies, though its geographical context appears to vary across reports. Primarily, it is identified as a city in **Guangdong Province**, where it serves as the **type locality** for several species within the genus *Atherigona*, including *Atherigona reversura* and *Atherigona yiwulushan*. These associations highlight its significance in the taxonomy and biodiversity of flies, particularly in the study of *Atherigona* species. However, a separate description notes a location named **Taishan** in **Shandong Province**, linked to the species *1341细角细麻蝇* (likely a Chinese name for a fly species, though the exact scientific nomenclature is unclear). This discrepancy suggests that \"\"Taishan\"\" may refer to distinct geographical sites in different provinces, or there may be an error in the data.  \n\nAdditionally, a survey on *Fannia incisurata* (a species of fly) was conducted in **Taishan**, though the specific province is not explicitly stated in this context. The survey was carried out by the **Jinzhou City Health and Epidemic Prevention Station**, which is located in **Liaoning Province**. This raises the possibility that the Taishan referenced in the survey could be a different location, potentially in Liaoning, or that the station collaborated on a study in another province. The lack of clarity in the survey’s location complicates the consolidation of Taishan’s role in entomological research.  \n\nIn summary, **Taishan** is most consistently associated with **Guangdong Province** as a type locality for *Atherigona* species and a site of ecological surveys. However, its mention in **Shandong Province** and the involvement of a **Liaoning-based institution** in a fly survey indicate either regional variations in the name \"\"Taishan\"\" or potential inconsistencies in the data. Further verification is needed to reconcile these geographical references and confirm whether multiple Taishan locations exist or if the discrepancies stem from reporting errors. The entity remains a focal point for studies on fly species, underscoring its ecological relevance in China’s biodiversity research.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",4\n3802,BELLARDIA CURVILOBA,\"A species of fly described by Liang and Gan in 1986, associated with Zhongdian, Yunnan (type locality)\",5\n3803,LIANG,\"\n\nLIANG is an author who described three species in 1986. In collaboration with Gan, they described the species *Bellardia curviloba*. Additionally, LIANG was a co-author in the description of *Bellardia micromenechma* and *Bellardia notomenechma*, both published in the same year. Separately, LIANG also described the species *Carcelia lymantriae* in 1986. These contributions highlight LIANG's role in taxonomic work within the genera *Bellardia* and *Carcelia* during that year. While the first *Bellardia* species was co-authored with Gan, the other two *Bellardia* species and the *Carcelia* species were described in partnership with additional collaborators, though the identities of these co-authors are not specified in the provided data. All four species (*Bellardia curviloba*, *Bellardia micromenechma*, *Bellardia notomenechma*, and *Carcelia lymantriae*) were formally documented in 1986, underscoring LIANG's active involvement in entomological or botanical classification during this period. The descriptions span multiple genera, indicating a diverse research focus. No contradictions exist in the data, as all entries consistently attribute the work to LIANG in 1986 with appropriate co-authorship details where available.\",3\n1888,WOLONG BALANG MOUNTAIN,\"\n\nWolong Balang Mountain is a geographical location in Sichuan, China, notable for its significance in entomological taxonomy. It serves as the type locality for two species of flies within the genus *Drymeia*: *Drymeia hirsutitibia* and *Drymeia stenoperistoma*. A type locality is the specific site where a species is first identified, described, and formally named, making Wolong Balang Mountain a critical reference point for these taxa. The mountain’s role in the classification of these species highlights its ecological and scientific importance, particularly in the study of biodiversity and evolutionary relationships among flies. While the descriptions provided do not specify additional details about the mountain’s physical characteristics, elevation, or broader ecological context, its designation as the type locality for both species underscores its relevance in taxonomic research. The presence of these two *Drymeia* species in the same region suggests that Wolong Balang Mountain may harbor a diverse or specialized ecosystem conducive to the development of unique arthropod fauna. Further studies or publications about the area could expand on its environmental features, but based on the available data, its primary significance lies in its association with the formal documentation of *Drymeia hirsutitibia* and *Drymeia stenoperistoma*. The mountain is likely part of the Wolong Nature Reserve, a well-known protected area in Sichuan renowned for its conservation efforts and rich biodiversity, though this connection is inferred and not explicitly stated in the provided descriptions. Overall, Wolong Balang Mountain is a key site in the taxonomic history of these two fly species, contributing to the understanding of their distribution and biological traits. Its role as a type locality ensures its recognition in scientific literature related to *Drymeia* taxonomy. (250 words)\",2\n1929,XESTOMYIA HIRTIFEMUR,\"A species of fly found in Qinghai, China, with holotype from Yushu Prefecture\",5\n1932,YUSHU PREFECTURE,\"\n\nYUSHU PREFECTURE is a region located in Qinghai Province, China, recognized for its ecological significance as a habitat for specific species of flies. It is the type locality for *Phaonia hamiloba*, a species of fly first described and identified in this area, which serves as a critical reference point in its taxonomic classification. Additionally, the prefecture is home to *Xestomyia hirtifemur*, another species of fly documented within its geographical boundaries. These two species highlight YUSHU PREFECTURE's role in entomological research, particularly in the study of dipteran biodiversity. The region’s unique environmental conditions, likely influenced by Qinghai’s high-altitude terrain and climate, contribute to the presence of such specialized fauna. While the descriptions provided focus on these two species, they collectively underscore the prefecture’s importance as both a natural habitat and a site of scientific discovery for fly species. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as both align on the prefecture’s location and its association with these two distinct species.\",2\n1892,WENCHUAN BALANG MOUNTAIN,\"Location in Sichuan, China, where Drymeia hirsutitibia is distributed.>\",1\n1218,URUMQI,\"\n\nUrumqi is a city located in Xinjiang Province, China, and serves as a significant site for entomological research, particularly in the study of fly species. It is recognized as the type locality for *Ascelotella formosana*, a species first described in the region, and as the holotype location for *Drymeia xinjiangensis*, which was also first identified there. Urumqi is further associated with *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, indicating its relevance to the distribution or ecological context of this species. Additionally, the city is the site where *Pegohylemyia mediospicula* was first described, underscoring its role in taxonomic discoveries. *Calythea nigra* is also documented as being distributed in Urumqi, contributing to the city’s biodiversity profile. These associations highlight Urumqi’s importance as a center for the study and documentation of diverse fly species, with multiple species either originating from or being prominently found in the area. The city’s entomological significance is reinforced by its repeated designation as a type or holotype locality, reflecting its historical and scientific value in the classification of these insects.
