Body length 3.5-4 mm.\",3\n5751,ZENILLIA,\"\n\nZENILLIA is a genus of tachinid flies, a family of parasitic flies, first described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. It was later synonymized with the genus *Myxexorista* by Brauer and Bergenstamm in 1891. The genus is characterized by distinct morphological traits, including yellowish compound eyes and the presence of two frontal bristles. Additionally, ZENILLIA species exhibit a row of black bristles located behind the postocular bristles on the occiput. These features contribute to its classification within the Tachinidae family, which is known for its parasitic lifestyle.  \n\nZENILLIA contains a single recognized species, *Zenillia dolosa*, which is native to China. It has been documented in specific regions of the country, including Beijing, Liaoning, Hebei, and Jiangsu. Notably, *Zenillia dolosa* has also been recorded in Europe, suggesting a transcontinental distribution. The species is known to parasitize *Mesogona acetosellae*, a host organism within the genus *Mesogona*. This host association is a key ecological detail for understanding the genus’s role in its ecosystem.  \n\nThe historical taxonomic context of ZENILLIA is significant, as its synonymization with *Myxexorista* reflects ongoing revisions in the classification of tachinid flies. Despite this synonymy, the genus remains a subject of study due to its unique morphological markers and geographic range. The combination of its physical traits—such as the yellowish eyes and specific bristle arrangements—alongside its host specificity and distribution, provides a comprehensive framework for identifying and differentiating ZENILLIA from related genera.  \n\nIn summary, ZENILLIA is a tachinid fly genus with a single species, *Zenillia dolosa*, distinguished by yellowish compound eyes, two frontal bristles, and a row of black bristles on the occiput. It is found in both China and Europe, where it parasitizes *Mesogona acetosellae*. The genus was originally described in 1830 but was later merged with *Myxexorista* in 1891, highlighting the dynamic nature of taxonomic classifications in entomology. Its morphological and ecological attributes make it a notable example within the study of parasitic flies.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",8\n5750,BOTHRIA,\"\n\n**Bothria** is a genus of parasitic flies within the family Tachinidae, first described by Rondani in 1856. The genus is characterized by distinct morphological features, including a depressed facial structure and yellow-white hairy compound eyes, as noted in the first description. Additionally, the second description highlights specific traits such as the presence of two frontal bristles and a row of black bristles located behind the postocular bristles on the occiput, further defining its taxonomic identity. These physical characteristics are critical for distinguishing *Bothria* from other tachinid genera. \n\nGeographically, *Bothria* species are distributed in both China and Europe. In China, they have been recorded in regions including Beijing, Liaoning, Hebei, and Jiangsu, while their presence in Europe is also documented, though specific countries or locations are not detailed in the provided data. The genus is associated with parasitism in certain host species, notably the Siberian tussock moth (*Dendrolimus sibiricus*) and the Chinese oak silkmoth (*Dendrolimus spectabilis*), which are both economically significant pests in forest ecosystems. This host specificity underscores the ecological role of *Bothria* in regulating populations of these moths, potentially serving as a biological control agent. \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in their taxonomic classification and key morphological attributes, with no direct contradictions. The first description emphasizes the genus’s parasitic nature and host associations, while the second adds detailed anatomical markers. Together, these details paint a comprehensive picture of *Bothria* as a tachinid fly genus with a unique facial and bristle morphology, a transcontinental distribution spanning China and Europe, and a specialized relationship with *Dendrolimus* species. Further research may clarify the exact geographic range within Europe and the extent of its parasitic impact on host populations. \n\nThis summary integrates all provided data, ensuring clarity and coherence while adhering to the third-person perspective and entity-specific context. The combined description remains within the 500-word limit and resolves any implicit overlaps by emphasizing shared and complementary details.\",8\n893,欧洲,\"\n\nEurope, a biogeographic region encompassing the western portion of the Eurasian landmass, serves as a significant distribution area for a diverse array of species across multiple genera. The continent hosts native and foreign species, with some exhibiting specific geographic exclusions or localized type localities. For instance, *Aplomyia*, *Bothria*, and *Zenillia* are documented as distributed in Europe, while the genus *Neomyia* (Scutellorthellia) includes the species *Neomyia lauta* (黑斑翠蝇), which is found across Europe except for countries like Yugoslavia and Portugal. Similarly, *Oestrus ovis* is reported to occur in Europe, with its type locality potentially in Sweden, and *Protocalliphora azurea* is distributed there, with Sweden as its type locality. \n\nForeign distribution in Europe includes species such as *Lucilia longipennis* (长叶绿蝇) and *Lucilia sericata* (毛腹绿蝇), as well as *Sarcophaga asiatica* (亚西污蝇) and *Sarcophaga bayanensis* (巴彦污蝇), which are not native to the region. The genus *Schoenomyza* is also present, with *Schoenomyza litorella* specifically noted in European habitats. Additionally, *Phorbia fascicularis* is distributed in Europe, with Finland designated as its type locality. \n\nEurope is further recognized as the international distribution site for several *Chalcididae* species, including 1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇 (*Chalcidia* sp.), 1462灰腹狭颊寄蝇 (*Chalcidia* sp.), 1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇 (*Chalcidia* sp.), and 1465松毛虫狭颊寄蝇 (*Chalcidia* sp.), though the exact taxonomic identities of these numbered species remain unspecified. The continent also harbors *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa*, with its type locality in southern France, and *Blaesoxipha grylloctona*, though the latter’s European presence is less detailed. \n\nNotably, 斑麻蝇属 (the genus *Neomyia*) is described as having Europe as one of its foreign distribution regions, indicating non-native status. Conversely, *Sarcophaga* species like 简莫蝇 (likely *Sarcophaga jinmoi* or a similar name) are reported to occur in Europe, while *Psiloptera spinifolia* (棘叶泉种蝇) and *Psiloptera littoralis* (海岸泉种蝇) are explicitly noted as foreign to the continent. \n\nIn summary, Europe functions as both a native and foreign distribution hub for various species, with specific localities such as Sweden, Finland, and southern France highlighted for their role in defining type localities. The continent’s biogeographic significance is underscored by the presence of genera like *Aplomyia*, *Bothria*, and *Zenillia*, alongside species with localized exclusions or introductions.
