He is credited with describing two notable species: *Bengalia (Eubengalia) latro* in 1910 and *Haematobia exigua* in 1903. The species *Bengalia latro* was later reclassified under the genus *Eubengalia*, reflecting updated taxonomic understanding, but De Meijere’s original 1910 description remains foundational to its classification. Additionally, his 1903 work on *Haematobia exigua* established its formal recognition in entomological literature. These contributions highlight his role in documenting and categorizing insect biodiversity during the early 20th century. De Meijere’s expertise in entomology and his meticulous descriptions of species have left a lasting impact on the field, providing critical reference points for subsequent research and taxonomic revisions. His work exemplifies the collaborative and evolving nature of scientific classification, where initial descriptions often serve as the basis for future refinements. By publishing these species, De Meijere advanced the understanding of their ecological and taxonomic significance, ensuring their inclusion in broader studies of insect morphology and distribution. Despite the limited information available about his broader career, his specific contributions to the classification of *Bengalia (Eubengalia) latro* and *Haematobia exigua* underscore his importance as a historical figure in entomology. The two species he described, separated by seven years, demonstrate his active engagement in the study of insects during a period of significant taxonomic activity. While *Bengalia latro* is associated with a reclassification under *Eubengalia*, the original 1910 description by De Meijere remains a key citation in its scientific history. Similarly, *Haematobia exigua*, first described in 1903, continues to be referenced in entomological contexts, attesting to the enduring value of his work. De Meijere’s legacy is preserved in the nomenclatural records of these species, which are now integral to ongoing research and conservation efforts. His dual role as both an author and entomologist reflects the interdisciplinary nature of early 20th-century scientific practice, where detailed fieldwork and literary documentation were closely intertwined. The absence of conflicting details in the provided descriptions allows for a unified account of his contributions, emphasizing his precision and dedication to the field. Overall, DE MEIJERE’s work remains a testament to the foundational role of early taxonomists in building the framework for modern entomological science.
