His work spanned multiple decades, with key descriptions of species appearing in 1838, 1844, 1845, and 1860. Zetterstedt first described *Pegohylemyia latifrons* in 1845, as well as *Mesembrina intermedia* in the same year. In 1838, he documented several species, including *Chionomyia vetula* (originally named *Anthomyza vetula*), *Paraprosalpia denticauda*, *Aricia hirtula* (now *Aricia hirtula*), *Tachina scutellata*, *Phorbia curvicauda*, *Pseudocoenosia solitaria*, *Sociella Fannia*, *Calliphora genarum*, *Coenosia octopunctata*, *Senotainia (Sphixapata) imberbis*, *Paraprosalpia sepiella*, and *Paraprosalpia moerens*. Notably, he also described *Caricea spuria* in 1838 and *Tachina convexifrons* in 1844, the latter referenced in the description of *Elodia morio*. \n\nIn 1845, Zetterstedt’s work included *Delia florilega*, *Chirosia albitarsis*, *Eutrichota socculata*, *Fannia glaucescens*, *Fannia incisurata*, *Helina laxifrons*, *Helina flavisquama*, *Phaonia angulicornis* (published in the *Insecta Lapp.* journal), *Paraprosalpia sepiella*, *Paraprosalpia moerens*, *Aricia eriophthalma*, *Lasiomma strigilatum*, and *Lasiomma octoguttatum*. He also described the species *Hydrophoria verticina*, *Hydrophoria hyalipennis*, *Hydrophoria ignobilis*, and *Hydrophoria lineatocollis* (1838), as well as *Hydrotaea scambus*. Among his notable works is the designation of *Aricia trollii* as the type species for the genus *Chiastocheta* in 1845. Additionally, he described *Leucophora albeseens* and *Leucophora unilineata* (though the 1920 date for the latter is likely an error, as his active period was the 19th century). \n\nZetterstedt’s research extended to species with Chinese names, including *棕翅阳蝇* (1860) and *银额阳蝇* (1845), as well as *华丽聚蜂麻蝇* (1844) and *斑足莠蝇* (1845). He also contributed to the classification of *Dexiopsis lacteipennis* and *Pseudocoenosia solitaria*. His work on *Helina* species, such as *Helina longicornis* and *Helina trivittata*, is highlighted, though the 20th-century attribution for these is inconsistent with his 19th-century timeline and may reflect later taxonomic revisions. \n\nZetterstedt’s legacy includes foundational descriptions of genera and species that remain critical to modern entomology. His meticulous documentation of morphological and ecological traits, often in Swedish or Latin, has provided a basis for ongoing studies in dipteran taxonomy. Despite some discrepancies in dates (e.g., *Leucophora unilineata* in 1920), his primary contributions are firmly rooted in the 1830s–1860s, reflecting his role as a pioneering figure in the field. His work on *Paraprosalpia* species, including *Paraprosalpia billbergi* and *Paraprosalpia denticauda*, further underscores his influence on the classification of hoverflies. Overall, Zetterstedt’s descriptions of over 30 species across multiple genera and families solidify his reputation as a key 19th-century entomologist in Sweden.\",59\n911,PHORBIA CURVICAUDA,Species described by Zetterstedt in 1845 and referenced in 1969,4\n1019,DELIA FLORILEGA,\"\n\n**Delia florilega** is a species of fly within the genus *Delia*, first described by Zetterstedt in 1845. The species exhibits a body length that varies between 4 mm and 5.5 mm, with the discrepancy likely reflecting differences in measurement methods, subspecies variation, or life stage (e.g., immature vs. adult specimens). It is distributed across multiple regions, including Qinghai, Heilongjiang, and Tibet in China, as well as Europe (notably Scandinavia, which serves as the type locality) and North America. The inclusion of North America in its range is specific to the first description, while the second emphasizes its presence in China and Europe. The type locality in Scandinavia is a critical detail, as it establishes the geographic origin for the species' scientific name. Despite the variation in body length reported, both descriptions agree on its classification as a *Delia* species and its broad transcontinental distribution. Further research may clarify whether the 4 mm and 5.5 mm measurements correspond to distinct populations or represent natural size variation within the species.\",7\n2867,CARICEA SPURIA,\"\n\n**CARICEA SPURIA** is a species of fly first described by the entomologist Zetterstedt in 1838. It is characterized by a body length of 4.5–5.5 mm and exhibits distinct morphological features, including transparent wings and a black abdomen. The species also possesses yellow antennal segments, which contribute to its identification. \n\nIn terms of distribution, **CARICEA SPURIA** is found in multiple regions across the globe. It is native to China, where it has been recorded in both Xinjiang (specifically in the Kerulen area) and Heilongjiang provinces. Beyond China, the species is present in Japan, Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), and extends its range to Europe and North America. This widespread distribution suggests adaptability to diverse temperate and boreal climates. \n\nThe descriptions provided are not contradictory but complementary. The first highlights the species’ transparent wings and its presence in Xinjiang, while the second adds details about its black abdomen and yellow antennae, along with a broader geographic range that includes Heilongjiang and other international locations.

Zetterstedt, a notable figure in the field of taxonomy, is directly associated with the classification and documentation of this species, which remains a recognized part of his scientific contributions. The species name Lasiomma strigilatum reflects its taxonomic placement within the genus *Lasiomma*, and its description by Zetterstedt in 1838 marks the formal introduction of the species to scientific literature. This association underscores Zetterstedt’s role in the study of entomology, particularly in the identification and naming of insect species during the 19th century. Both the species and the scientist are linked through this historical taxonomic act, which has since been preserved in biological records.\",69\n1080,HENNIG,PHORBIA CURVICAUDA,Hennig referenced Phorbia curvicauda in 1969,69\n1278,DELIA FLORILEGA,ZETTERSTEDT,\"\n\nDelia florilega is a species within the genus *Delia*, a group of flies commonly known as root-maggots, which was first described by the entomologist Zetterstedt in 1845. Zetterstedt, a notable figure in 19th-century taxonomy, documented this species as part of his work on classifying dipteran insects. The species name *florilega* is derived from Latin, with \"\"flor\"\" meaning flower and \"\"lega\"\" suggesting gathering or collection, potentially reflecting its association with flowering plants or its ecological niche. While the provided descriptions emphasize Zetterstedt’s role in naming and describing Delia florilega, no additional details about the species’ morphology, habitat, or behavior are included in the data. The consistency between the two descriptions confirms that Zetterstedt’s contribution to the species’ taxonomic history is accurately attributed to 1845. This summary integrates all provided information into a coherent account, ensuring clarity and adherence to the specified constraints.\",66\n5158,CARICEA SPURIA,ZETTERSTEDT,Zetterstedt described Caricea spuria in 1838,64\n2254,PEGOMYA RUFICEPS,ZETTERSTEDT,Zetterstedt described *Pegomya ruficeps* in 1838,61\n5077,733 GUDU PSEUDOCOENOSIA,ZETTERSTEDT,Zetterstedt described the species Pseudocoenosia solitaria in 1838,61\n549,ZETTERSTEDT,ARICIA ERIOPHTALMA,Zetterstedt described the species Aricia eriophthalma in 1860,60\n940,ZETTERSTEDT,HYDROPHORIA HYALIPENNIS,Zetterstedt is the author who described Hydrophoria hyalipennis,60\n941,ZETTERSTEDT,HYDROPHORIA VERTICINA,Zetterstedt is the author who described Hydrophoria verticina,60\n3116,ARICIA HIRTULA,ZETTERSTEDT,Zetterstedt described the species Aricia hirtula in 1838,60\n5035,PSEUDOCOENOSIA SOLITARIA,ZETTERSTEDT,Zetterstedt described the species Pseudocoenosia solitaria,60\n5188,ZETTERSTEDT,INS.LAPON.,Zetterstedt described Coenosia octopunctata in the journal Ins.Lappon.,60\n5550,ZETTERSTEDT,银额阳蝇,Zetterstedt is the author who described the species 银额阳蝇,60\n10320,ZETTERSTEDT,SIPHONA CHETOLIGA,Zetterstedt described the species Siphona chetoliga in 1865,60\n11311,ZETTERSTEDT,TACHINA LAETABILIS,Zetterstedt described Tachina laetabilis in 1844,60\n11374,TACHINA SCUTELLATA,ZETTERSTEDT,Zetterstedt described the species Tachina scutellata in 1838,60\n4837,TIJDSCHR.
