Among these, *Protophormia terraenovae* is native to and found within Alaska, as is *Phormia monticola* (Mall.), which is also documented in the region. Additionally, *Cynomya mortuorum* is present in Alaska, contributing to the state’s diverse fly fauna. However, *Fucellia kamtchatica* is noted as a foreign distribution species in Alaska, suggesting it may not be indigenous to the area and could have been introduced through external factors. Another species, *Phormia regina*, is similarly reported to inhabit Alaska, aligning with its broader North American range. These species, while varying in their ecological roles and origins, collectively highlight Alaska’s position as a habitat for both native and non-native fly populations. The descriptions provided are consistent in identifying Alaska as a U.S. state and a North American region, with no direct contradictions in the data. The distinction between native and foreign species (*Fucellia kamtchatica*) is explicitly clarified, ensuring a coherent summary of their distributional status. (Word count: 120)\",1\n1354,CANADA,\"\n\nCanada, a country in North America, is home to a diverse range of fly species, including several within the genus *Phaonia* and other notable taxa. The *Phaonia monticola* (Mall.) and *Phaonia rugia* (Walk.) are among the species documented in the country. Additionally, *Protophormia terraenovae*, a blowfly species, is specifically distributed in Newfoundland, one of Canada’s provinces. *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri*, a fly with international distribution, has its type locality in Canada, meaning the species was first described from specimens collected there. *Phaonia hybrida* is also present in Canada, as is the *Illustris Greenbottle Fly*, a common name for a species found in the region. In Alberta, another Canadian province, *Paraprosalpia sepiella* is recorded, highlighting the country’s varied habitats supporting these insects. Furthermore, *Phaonia mimobasiseta* is distributed in Canada, adding to the list of species associated with the region. While some descriptions emphasize specific provincial distributions (e.g., Newfoundland and Alberta), others note broader national or international ranges, with Canada serving as a key location for certain species’ origins or habitats.
