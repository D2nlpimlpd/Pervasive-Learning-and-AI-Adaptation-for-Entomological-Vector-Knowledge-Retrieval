The 1980s marked a prolific period, with **Sinohylemya ctenocnema** and **Sinohylemya craspedodonta** introduced in 1980, followed by **Hebecnema alba** (1983) and **Syllegopterula flava** (1983). In 1981, HSUE documented **Coenosis subflavicornis**, **Hydrophoria ventribarbata**, **Paraprosalpia qinghoensis**, **Pegomya centaureeodes**, and **Servaisia cothurnata**, the latter also in 1978. Additionally, HSUE described **Helina rastrella** in *Acta Entomologica Sinica* and **Phaonia recta** in 1984, along with **Phaonia aureoloides** in the same year. In 1982, HSUE contributed to the taxonomy of **Limnophora interfrons** and **Limnophora latiorbitalis**. Their work spans diverse genera such as *Blaesoxipha*, *Bellardia*, *Sinohylemya*, *Hydrotaea*, *Hydrophoria*, *Paraprosalpia*, *Pegomya*, *Servaisia*, *Limnophora*, and *Phaonia*, with notable species including *craspedodonta*, *ctenocnema*, *recta*, *aureoloides*, and *flava*. HSUE’s descriptions often appear in scientific literature, reflecting a focus on dipteran taxonomy.

The species was first described in 1976 by the scientific author **Hsue**, who is credited with its formal taxonomic classification. Hsue's work established *Hydrotaea silva* as a distinct entity within the broader context of hydrotaeid fly research, contributing to the understanding of biodiversity in this taxonomic group. The name \"\"silva\"\" likely reflects a characteristic or inspiration related to the species' habitat or morphology, though specific details about its ecological or physical traits are not provided in the descriptions. Hsue's role as the describer of *Hydrotaea silva* underscores their contribution to entomological science, particularly in the study of flies. Both the entity *Hydrotaea silva* and the author Hsue are directly linked through this taxonomic act, with the year 1976 marking the formal recognition of the species. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as both descriptions consistently attribute the 1976 description of *Hydrotaea silva* to Hsue. This summary consolidates the key information, emphasizing the relationship between the species and its describer while adhering to the constraints of coherence and brevity.\",32\n5616,HELINA RASTRELLA,HSUE,Hsue described Helina rastrella in 1985,32\n7076,LIAONING BELLARDIA,HSUE,Hsue described the species Liaoning Bellardia,32\n1059,HSUE,长白山,\"Sinohylemya craspedodonta is distributed in Changbai Mountain, as documented by Hsue\",31\n4536,MYDAEA GRACILIOR,HSUE,Hsue described the new species Mydaea gracilior,31\n5208,ANIMAL TAXONOMY,HSUE,Hsue described Coenosia subflavicornis in the journal Animal Taxonomy.,31\n6083,PHANOIA RECTA,HSUE,Hsue described Phaonia recta,31\n1060,HSUE,本溪南甸,\"Benxi Nandian is the type locality for Sinohylemya craspedodonta, as described by Hsue\",30\n1061,HSUE,雅安,\"Sinohylemya craspedodonta is distributed in Ya'an, as documented by Hsue\",30\n5209,HSUE,INSECTOLOGICAL JOURNAL,Hsue published the species Coenosis subflavicornis in the Chinese Journal of Entomology,30\n976,HYDROPHORIA VENTRIBARBATA,TONGHUA HANI,Tonghua Hani in Jilin is the type locality for Hydrophoria ventribarbata,4\n2063,PARAPROSALPIA QINGHOENSIS,BENXI QINGHECHENG,\"The species is distributed in Benxi Qinghecheng, Liaoning\",4\n6066,JOURNAL OF INSECT CLASSIFICATION,PHANOIA RECTA,The species Phaonia recta was published in the Journal of Insect Classification,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
