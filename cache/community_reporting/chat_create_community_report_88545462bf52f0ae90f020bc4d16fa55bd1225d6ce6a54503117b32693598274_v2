It serves as a source for entomological research, with contributions detailing the morphology, distribution, and classification of various taxa. The series has published descriptions of multiple species across different genera, including *Helina leptinocorpus* and *Helina subhirsutibia* (likely within the family Muscidae or related), *Calythea xizangensis* (a species associated with the Xizang region, or Tibet), and *Leucophora shanxiensis* (noted for its distribution in Shanxi Province). Additionally, it has documented species of the genus *Pegohylemyia* and *Metalliopsis*, including *Metalliopsis producta* and *Metalliopsis ciliilunula*. These publications collectively highlight the series’ role in advancing understanding of China’s insect fauna, with a particular emphasis on regional biodiversity and the discovery of new or understudied species. The series appears to prioritize detailed taxonomic work, often providing insights into ecological contexts, geographic ranges, and morphological characteristics. While the specific focus on genera and species varies across entries, the overarching theme is the systematic study and dissemination of entomological data from China, contributing to both national and global scientific knowledge. The inclusion of species from diverse regions such as Tibet and Shanxi underscores its geographic breadth, and the repeated mention of multiple genera suggests a multidisciplinary approach to insect research. The INSECT RESEARCH SERIES is thus a critical resource for entomologists, offering peer-reviewed documentation of China’s rich and varied insect life.\",12\n1210,PEGOHYLEMIA LATIRUFIFRONS,Fly species described by Fan in 1984,3\n1062,SEUY,Author of Leucophora amicula,2\n3174,WU ET AL.,Wu et al. are the authors of the species Helina subhirsutibia,2\n4244,\"RECORD, INDIAN MUSEUM\",Publication source for Metalliopsis setosa,1\n4257,YUNAN (PINGBIAN),Region in China where Metalliopsis setosa is distributed,1\n4258,\"FUJIAN (JIANYANG, HUANGKENG, GUZHU)\",Region in China where Metalliopsis setosa is distributed,1\n4259,XIZANG (MOTING),Region in China where Metalliopsis setosa is distributed,1\n3130,HELINA TRUNCATA,\"Helina truncata is a species of fly described by Fang et Fan in 1987, with a body length of 6 mm and yellow coloration on the mid and hind tibiae\",3\n3131,FANG ET FAN,\"\n\nFANG ET FAN are researchers known for their contributions to taxonomy, particularly in the description of multiple species across different genera. They are credited with describing the species *Helina truncata* in 1987, as well as *Helina leptinocorpus*, though the specific year for the latter is not explicitly mentioned in the provided data. Additionally, Fang et Fan described several species within the genus *Metalliopsis* during the years 1984 and 1986. Their work spans both the *Helina* and *Metalliopsis* genera, indicating a focus on entomology or a related field, likely involving dipteran insects given the naming conventions of these genera. The descriptions of *Helina truncata* and *Metalliopsis* species were published in distinct years (1984, 1986, and 1987), suggesting a sustained effort in taxonomic research over this period. While the exact number of *Metalliopsis* species they described is unspecified, the phrasing \"\"multiple\"\" implies contributions to the classification of more than one species in that genus. Their work on *Helina leptinocorpus* further underscores their role in expanding the understanding of the *Helina* genus. Collectively, Fang et Fan’s publications highlight their expertise in documenting and categorizing insect species, with notable activity in the mid-1980s. The lack of a specific year for *Helina leptinocorpus* does not conflict with the other descriptions, as it may have been published in a different year or grouped with their broader *Helina* research. Their legacy in this field is marked by these taxonomic contributions, which provide foundational references for subsequent studies on these organisms.\",8\n3132,HELINA CURTOSTYLATA,\"Helina curtostylata is a species of fly described by Fang et Fan in 1987, with a body length of 7 mm and specific tibial bristle patterns\",2\n3177,HANYUAN,Hanyuan is the type locality for Helina leptinocorpus,1\n4246,METALLIOPSIS PRODUCTA,\"A species of Metalliopsis described by Fang et Fan in 1984, with specific morphological features and distribution in China\",5\n4253,GUANGDONG (CHAOAN),\"Region in China where Metalliopsis setosa is distributed\nRegion in China where Metalliopsis producta and Metalliopsis ciliilunula are distributed\",3\n946,KUNMING,\"\n\nKUNMING is a city located in Yunnan Province, China, and serves as a significant reference point in entomological studies. It is explicitly noted as a domestic distribution location for the species *Limnophora fallax fallax*, indicating its role in the geographic range of this organism. Additionally, Kunming is highlighted as part of the distribution range for *Delia bracata*, further underscoring its ecological relevance for certain insect populations. The city is also referenced in the taxonomic key for *Sarcophagini*, a family of flies (Sarcophagidae), suggesting that it is a site where species within this family have been documented or studied. These descriptions collectively establish Kunming as a hub for biodiversity research, particularly in the context of insect species. While the specific species associated with the *Sarcophagini* key are not named in the provided data, the repeated emphasis on Kunming’s role in entomological taxonomy and distribution aligns with its reputation as a biologically diverse region in Yunnan. The city’s inclusion in these scientific records reflects its importance as a location for both local and regional ecological studies. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as they all consistently identify Kunming as a Yunnan, China-based entity linked to the distribution or classification of various species.
