It is characterized by a single black dorsal abdominal stripe, a long arista (a bristle-like structure on the head), and a body length of approximately 6.5 mm. The species is known to inhabit multiple continents, including Asia, Europe, and North America. Specific records indicate its presence in the Chinese province of Heilongjiang, as well as in Sweden (notably in the Lycks region) and other parts of Europe. Its distribution in North America has also been documented, though exact locations are not specified in the provided data. The fly’s morphological features, such as the distinctive abdominal marking and elongated arista, are key identifiers for taxonomic classification. While the descriptions are consistent in naming, physical traits, and geographic range, the inclusion of \"\"Heilongjiang\"\" in the first description clarifies its Asian distribution, which is only broadly noted in the second. No contradictions exist in the data, allowing for a unified summary of this species.\",9\n839,HYDROPHORIA IGNOBILIS,\"A species of fly with 4-7 infraorbital bristles, a black dorsal abdominal stripe, and a body length of 5-5.5 mm. Found in Heilongjiang, Kamchatka, Northern Europe (Lapland), and North America. Described by Zetterstedt in 1845\",4\n638,KAMCHATKA,\"\n\nKamchatka, a Russian region located in the Far East, is recognized as a significant area for biodiversity, particularly in entomology. It is associated with several species of flies and other arthropods, as documented in various taxonomic and ecological studies. The region is linked to the species *Pegohylemyia striolata*, which was studied in the context of Hennig’s 1970 work, highlighting its role in historical entomological research. Additionally, *Acrostilpna aculeata* is explicitly noted as being distributed in Kamchatka, underscoring the area’s ecological relevance for this species. \n\nKamchatka’s connection to the Soviet Union is also evident in its historical taxonomic records. For instance, *Egle muscaria* is mentioned in the distribution context of the Soviet Union, reflecting the region’s inclusion in that geopolitical entity during earlier studies. Similarly, *Phaonia malaisei* has its type locality in Kamchatka as part of the Soviet Union, emphasizing the area’s importance in defining the species’ origin. Other species, such as *Acklandia subgrisea* and *Egle minuta*, are also documented as distributed in Kamchatka, further illustrating its role as a habitat for diverse fly populations. \n\nThe region is home to multiple species of the genus *Hydrophoria*, including *Hydrophoria ignobilis* and *Hydrophoria lineatocollis*, both of which are found in Kamchatka. Additionally, *Leucophora unilineata* is reported to inhabit the area, contributing to the region’s entomological profile. These findings collectively position Kamchatka as a key location for studying dipteran (true fly) diversity, with its ecosystems supporting both endemic and widely distributed species. \n\nWhile some descriptions reference Kamchatka as part of the Soviet Union, this aligns with historical taxonomic practices and does not contradict its current status as a Russian region. The data consistently highlight Kamchatka’s ecological significance, particularly in the context of fly species distribution and historical research. Its remote and relatively undisturbed environment likely supports unique biodiversity, making it a focal point for entomological studies. Overall, Kamchatka serves as a critical region for understanding the biogeography and taxonomy of these species, with contributions spanning both Soviet-era and post-Soviet research.\",7\n847,LYCKS,Location in Sweden (Karskaya Tundra) as the type locality for Hydrophoria melaena,1\n846,NORTHERN EUROPE,\"\n\nNorthern Europe is a geographical region in the northern part of the European continent, encompassing countries such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, and parts of the United Kingdom, though specific distributions may vary among species. The region is associated with several biological entities, including the insect *Thricops coquilletti*, which is found in Northern Europe as a non-native or foreign species. Similarly, *Brontaea humilis*, a plant or animal species, is present in Northern Europe and is described as being found internationally within the region. The term \"\"Shuangban Jiewei Jiying,\"\" which appears to be a Chinese name or phrase, is also linked to Northern Europe as an international region, though its exact classification or relevance remains unspecified in the data.  \n\nThe region supports the distribution of *Alloeostylus plumbea*, a species native to or commonly found in Europe’s northern territories. However, the insect *Actia nigroscutellata* is noted to be distributed in Northern Europe with the exception of Britain, indicating a partial exclusion of the UK from its range. Additionally, Northern Europe is home to three species of the *Hydrophoria* genus: *Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria ignobilis*, and *Hydrophoria lineatocollis*, which collectively inhabit the region.  \n\nWhile most descriptions emphasize Northern Europe as a shared or international habitat for these species, the exclusion of Britain for *Actia nigroscutellata* introduces a regional distinction. This contradiction is resolved by specifying that the species’ distribution spans Northern Europe but does not include the UK. The other entities—*Thricops coquilletti*, *Brontaea humilis*, *Shuangban Jiewei Jiying*, *Alloeostylus plumbea*, and the *Hydrophoria* species—are consistently described as being found within or associated with Northern Europe, either as part of their native range or through international presence.  \n\nIn summary, Northern Europe serves as a key habitat for these species, with variations in their native status and distribution boundaries. The region’s ecological diversity supports both endemic and introduced species, while the exclusion of Britain for *Actia nigroscutellata* highlights the need for nuanced geographic specificity in biological records. The presence of multiple *Hydrophoria* species and the international associations of *Brontaea humilis* and *Shuangban Jiewei Jiying* further underscore Northern Europe’s role as a crossroads for biodiversity and global ecological interactions.
