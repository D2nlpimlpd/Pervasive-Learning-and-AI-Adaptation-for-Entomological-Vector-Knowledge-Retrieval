He first gained recognition in 1916 for documenting the parasitism of the genus *Sphegina* (斑麻蝇属) on locusts, a significant ecological observation in entomology. In 1925, he described the species *Mesembrina magnifica*, and the following year (1926), he authored the description of *Peteina hyperdiscalis*. By 1930, Aldrich had described multiple genera and species, including the genus *Xanthotryxus* and its species *X. mongol*, as well as the genus *Aldrichina*, which was later named in his honor for the species *Aldrichina grahami* (Aldrich, 1930). The same year, he also provided the first description of *Dexopollenia flava*. In 1932, he described the large hoverfly *Scathophaga gigantea* and the genus *Trophops*, though the latter was later synonymized with *Pexopsis*. His work continued into 1933 with the description of *Elodia subfasciata*, and in 1935, he documented *Dexopollenia geniculata*. Additionally, Aldrich is credited as the author of *Mesembrina tristis*, further expanding his taxonomic legacy in the *Mesembrina* genus. His research spanned diverse fly families, including Syrphidae (hoverflies) and Tachinidae (parasitic flies), with a focus on morphological classification and ecological relationships. The genus *Aldrichina*, established for the species *A. grahami*, remains a direct tribute to his work. Despite the synonymization of *Trophops*, his descriptions of *Dexopollenia* species and other genera have endured in scientific literature. Aldrich’s contributions, spanning over two decades, reflect a dedicated effort to catalog and understand dipteran biodiversity, particularly in regions where his studies were conducted. His work in 1930, which included both *Xanthotryxus* and *Aldrichina*, highlights his dual role as both a describer of new taxa and a namesake for a genus. The 1935 description of *Dexopollenia geniculata* further underscores his ongoing engagement with fly taxonomy. Overall, Aldrich’s legacy is preserved in the nomenclature of several species and genera, as well as in historical records of parasitic interactions, cementing his place in entomological history.
