They are credited with describing the species *Helina truncata* in 1987, as well as *Helina leptinocorpus*, though the specific year for the latter is not explicitly mentioned in the provided data. Additionally, Fang et Fan described several species within the genus *Metalliopsis* during the years 1984 and 1986. Their work spans both the *Helina* and *Metalliopsis* genera, indicating a focus on entomology or a related field, likely involving dipteran insects given the naming conventions of these genera. The descriptions of *Helina truncata* and *Metalliopsis* species were published in distinct years (1984, 1986, and 1987), suggesting a sustained effort in taxonomic research over this period. While the exact number of *Metalliopsis* species they described is unspecified, the phrasing \"\"multiple\"\" implies contributions to the classification of more than one species in that genus. Their work on *Helina leptinocorpus* further underscores their role in expanding the understanding of the *Helina* genus. Collectively, Fang et Fan’s publications highlight their expertise in documenting and categorizing insect species, with notable activity in the mid-1980s. The lack of a specific year for *Helina leptinocorpus* does not conflict with the other descriptions, as it may have been published in a different year or grouped with their broader *Helina* research. Their legacy in this field is marked by these taxonomic contributions, which provide foundational references for subsequent studies on these organisms.\",8\n3132,HELINA CURTOSTYLATA,\"Helina curtostylata is a species of fly described by Fang et Fan in 1987, with a body length of 7 mm and specific tibial bristle patterns\",2\n3177,HANYUAN,Hanyuan is the type locality for Helina leptinocorpus,1\n4249,METALLIOPSIS ERINACEA,\"A species of Metalliopsis described by Fang et Fan in 1984, with specific black setae and distribution in China\",2\n4262,ZHEJIANG (QINGYUAN),,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5606,HELINA TRUNCATA,FANG ET FAN,Fang et Fan described Helina truncata in 1987,11\n5609,FANG ET FAN,HELINA CURTOSTYLATA,Fang et Fan described Helina curtostylata in 1987,10\n5709,FANG ET FAN,HANYUAN,Fang et Fan's species Helina leptinocorpus has a type locality in Hanyuan,9\n8029,METALLIOPSIS ERINACEA,ZHEJIANG (QINGYUAN),\"The species is distributed in Zhejiang (Qingyuan, type locality)\",3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
