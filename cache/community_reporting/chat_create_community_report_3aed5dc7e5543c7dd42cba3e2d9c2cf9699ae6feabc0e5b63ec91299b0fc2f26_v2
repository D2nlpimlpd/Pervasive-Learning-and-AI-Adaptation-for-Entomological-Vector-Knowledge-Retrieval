He established the genus *Nupedia* in 1928, a detail mentioned in multiple sources, though one conflicting description notes 1930; the 1928 date is more consistently cited and likely accurate. Karl described several species, including *Strobilomyia laricicola* (1928), *Pseudonupedia trigonalis* (1928), *Lispocephala miki* (1935), *Pegomya quadrivittata* (1935), *Hydrotaea affinis* (1935), *Delia trispinosa*, and *Helina ciliata* (1929). Additionally, he contributed to the taxonomy of the genus *Delia (Chorto Philina)* in 1928 and *Pygophora trimaculata* in 1935. Karl also authored the synonym *Pegohylemyia macra* (1940) for *Pegohylemyia betarum*, and his work included references to the genus *Cryptolucilia* in 1928. Among his publications, he described *Brontaea distincta* in 1915 and *Brontaea nigrogrisea* in 1939, as well as *Atherigona biseta* and *Atherigona crassibifurca*. The species *613点芒蝇* (likely a Chinese name for an unspecified fly species) is also attributed to his work. Karl’s career spanned significant taxonomic activity, with a focus on dipteran insects, and his descriptions and synonyms remain foundational in entomological literature. His role as a researcher and scientist is underscored by the breadth of his contributions across genera and species, though the exact scope of his work beyond taxonomy is not detailed in the provided data. The conflicting dates for *Nupedia* (1928 vs. 1930) are resolved by prioritizing the more frequently cited 1928.
