Additionally, Sweden is likely the type locality for *Helina confinis*, *Mydaea setifemur*, and *Hilarella stictica*, while regions like Lapland, Gotland, and Scania are specifically cited as type localities for *Insecta lapponica* (Scania), *Lasiomma octoguttatum* (Gotland), and *Helina longicornis* (Lapland).  \n\nThe country hosts a diverse range of distributed species, such as *Fannia bisetosa*, *Coelomyia subpellucens*, *Delia bisetosa*, *Lasiomma strigilatum*, *Subhylemyia longula*, *Leucophora grisella*, *Polietes nigrolimbata*, *Limnophora triangula*, and *Pegohylemyia latifrons*. It is also associated with the type localities of *Fannia difficilis*, *Fannia similis*, and *Lispe loewi* (with *Lispe litorea* also linked to Sweden). The genus *Adia* and species *Periscepsia carbonaria* are documented as having international distributions that include Sweden, while *Pegohylemyia hucketti* is noted as having a type locality in Nordic Europe, likely within Sweden.  \n\nFurther, Sweden is the type locality for *Delia brassicaeformis* and *Delia radicum*, and it supports the presence of *Coenosia mollicula*, *Coenosia flavicornis*, and *Coenosia incisurata*.
