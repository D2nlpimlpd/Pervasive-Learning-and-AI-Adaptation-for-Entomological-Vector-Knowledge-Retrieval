Additionally, Guiyang is cited in the taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, a family of flies (Diptera: Sarcophagidae), indicating its relevance in the classification and identification of species within this group. The city’s role in both specimen collection and taxonomic documentation highlights its importance as a hub for biodiversity studies in the region. While the descriptions provided focus on specific scientific contexts, they collectively underscore Guiyang’s ecological and academic significance in the study of insect taxonomy and related biological research. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as both align on the city’s location and its association with entomological work.\",1\n1742,ROBINEAU-DESVIOUDY,\"\n\n**Robineau-Desvoidy** was a notable entomologist and taxonomist recognized for his significant contributions to the classification of flies. He is credited with describing multiple genera within the Diptera order, including *Hydrotaea*, *Ophyra*, and *Xestomyia*, which are now foundational in the study of fly taxonomy. In 1830, Robineau-Desvoidy formally described the genus *Tachina*, a group of robber flies, and also documented the species *Neomyia indica*, commonly known as the Indian greenbottle fly, which is native to South Asia. His work on *Neomyia indica* provided early taxonomic clarity for this blow fly, which is ecologically and economically relevant due to its role in decomposition and potential pest status. While the descriptions highlight his role in defining both genera and species, there is no contradiction in the data, as *Tachina* refers to a genus and *Neomyia indica* to a specific species. Robineau-Desvoidy’s efforts in the 19th century advanced the understanding of fly biodiversity, particularly in regions like India, and his classifications remain referenced in modern entomological literature. His legacy is preserved through the scientific names he assigned, which continue to be used in taxonomic studies and ecological research.

It is recognized as a site associated with the presence of two distinct species: *Sarcosolomonia crinita* and *Synorbitomyia linearis*. *Sarcosolomonia crinita* is a species of marine organism, potentially a type of algae or invertebrate, whose ecological or biological significance in the port area remains under study. Meanwhile, *Synorbitomyia linearis* is a species of fly, likely part of the Diptera order, which may inhabit or interact with the local environment of the port. The port’s connection to these species highlights its role as a biodiversity hotspot or a location of scientific interest for researchers studying marine and coastal ecosystems. While the descriptions do not specify the nature of the association (e.g., whether the species are native, invasive, or studied in the area), the repeated mention of Hengchun Port in relation to both organisms underscores its ecological relevance. The port’s geographical position in southern Taiwan, near the Hengchun Peninsula, may contribute to unique environmental conditions that support such species. Further research or documentation would be required to clarify the exact ecological relationships or conservation status of these organisms in the region. Overall, HENGCHUN PORT serves as a notable reference point for studies involving *Sarcosolomonia crinita* and *Synorbitomyia linearis*, reflecting its importance in local biodiversity and scientific inquiry.\",2\n1760,XESTOMYIA,A genus of flies with 4 posteroventral median bristles,1\n1769,SKIN PIERCING FOR BLOOD,,2\n1768,EXTERNAL PARASITISM OF NESTLINGS,Ecological behavior of Hydrotaea genus larvae,1\n1759,OPHYRA,A genus of flies with shiny black body coloration and metallic sheen,2\n2311,DASYPHORA CYANICOLOR,\"Dasyphora cyanicolor is a subspecies mentioned in the Fauna of India, Dipt.7, Muscidac(1): 144\",1\n3032,DICHAETOMYIA MONTICOLA,\"A species of fly (Dichaetomyia monticola Emden, 1965) with body length 6-6.6 mm and distinct blackish dorsal plates\",2\n1839,FAUNA INDIA,\"\n\n**FAUNA INDIA** is a comprehensive publication focused on documenting the taxonomic details of various species within the Indian subcontinent. It serves as a critical reference for entomological and zoological research, particularly in the classification and description of insect species. The publication includes records of **Megophyra species**, providing detailed taxonomic information that aids in their identification and study. Additionally, **Musca malaisei** and **Musca santoshi**, two species within the genus *Musca*, are documented in *Fauna India*, contributing to the understanding of their morphology, distribution, and ecological roles. The work also references **Dichaetomyia monticola**, a species belonging to the family **Muscidae**, with a specific note citing its inclusion in *Fauna India* as \"\"Muscidae, (1): 361,\"\" indicating the volume, issue, and page number where the species is described. These entries collectively highlight the publication’s role in cataloging diverse insect taxa, emphasizing its utility for researchers and taxonomists. By consolidating data on species such as *Megophyra*, *Musca*, and *Dichaetomyia*, *Fauna India* offers a structured and authoritative resource for studying the region’s biodiversity. The publication’s meticulous documentation of taxonomic details ensures clarity and consistency, even when multiple species are referenced across different sections. Its inclusion of family-level classifications, like Muscidae for *Dichaetomyia monticola*, further contextualizes the relationships between species. Overall, *Fauna India* stands as a foundational text for systematic studies of Indian fauna, particularly in entomology, by providing verified scientific records and facilitating comparative analyses across documented taxa. The work’s attention to detail and organization underscores its importance in advancing knowledge of the region’s ecological and evolutionary dynamics.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4081,JAPAN,NEOMYIA INDICA,The Indian greenbottle fly is distributed in Japan,237\n5398,YUNNAN,DICHAEATOMYIA MONTICOLA,\"The species is distributed in Yunnan, China\",164\n8308,MACRONYCHIA POLYODON,MEIGEN,Meigen described Macronychia polyodon in 1824,134\n9391,TAIWAN,SARCOSOLOMONIA CRINITA,The species Sarcosolomonia crinita is distributed in Taiwan,120\n3592,EMDEN,MUSCA PILIFACIES,Emden described Musca pilifacies in 1965,37\n3866,EUDASYPHORA KEMPI,EMDEN,Emden described the species Eudasyphora kempi in 1965,37\n3303,POLIETES FUSCISQUAMOSUS,EMDEN,Emden described the species Polietes fuscisquamosus in 1965,36\n5770,ZONGQUAN YANGYING,EMDEN,Emden described the species ZONGQUAN YANGYING,35\n3649,MUSCA MALAISEI EMDEN,EMDEN,Emden described the species Musca malaisei in 1956,32\n5361,MONTICOLA DICHAETOMYIA,EMDEN,EMDEN classified the MONTICOLA DICHAETOMYIA species,32\n6247,PHANOIA HETEROMMA,EMDEN,Emden is the author of Phaonia heteromma,32\n2875,EMDEN,MEGOPHYRA,Emden is the author of the genus Megophyra,31\n3811,EMDEN,DASYPHORA VERSICOLOR,Emden described the species Dasyphora versicolor in 1965,31\n5354,金缘重亳蝇,EMDEN,Emden is the author who described Dichaetomyia aureomarginata,31\n5360,山栖重毫蝇,EMDEN,Emden is the author who described Dichaetomyia monticola,31\n5422,EMDEN,DICHAEATOMYIA KEISERI,Emden described the species Dichaetomyia keiseri in 1965,31\n3603,MYANMAR,MUSCA PILIFACIES,Musca pilifacies is distributed in Myanmar,29\n4087,BANGLADESH,NEOMYIA INDICA,The Indian greenbottle fly is distributed in Bangladesh (type locality),19\n4104,FAUNA OF INDIA,NEOMYIA INDICA,Fauna of India documents the Indian greenbottle fly,18\n8312,MACRONYCHIA POLYODON,ROHEDENDORF,Rohdendorf contributed to the taxonomic key for Macronychia polyodon,14\n8314,MACRONYCHIA POLYODON,PINGGU,\"The species is found in Pinggu, Beijing\",14\n4847,LIMNOPHORA PROMINENS,GUANGYI,\"Limnophora prominens is distributed in Guangyi, Guizhou\",11\n4848,LIMNOPHORA PROMINENS,ZHOU ZHIKUN,Zhou ZhiKun collected Limnophora prominens in Guizhou,11\n4856,LIMNOPHORA PROMINENS,GUIYANG,\"The species is found in Guiyang, Guizhou\",11\n2872,ROBINEAU-DESVIOUDY,HYDROTAEA,Robineau-Desvoidy is the author of the genus Hydrotaea,8\n3598,JIAYI,MUSCA PILIFACIES,\"Musca pilifacies is distributed in Jiayi, Taiwan\",8\n3599,NANTOU,MUSCA PILIFACIES,\"Musca pilifacies is distributed in Nantou, Taiwan\",8\n3600,ALISHAN,MUSCA PILIFACIES,\"Musca pilifacies is distributed in Alishan, Taiwan\",8\n9395,HENGCHUN PORT,SARCOSOLOMONIA CRINITA,\"The species Sarcosolomonia crinita is found in Hengchun Port, Taiwan\",7\n2874,ROBINEAU-DESVIOUDY,XESTOMYIA,Robineau-Desvoidy is the author of the genus Xestomyia,6\n2885,HYDROTAEA,SKIN PIERCING FOR BLOOD,Hydrotaea larvae pierce skin to feed on blood,5\n2884,HYDROTAEA,EXTERNAL PARASITISM OF NESTLINGS,Hydrotaea larvae parasitize bird nestlings,4\n2886,OPHYRA,SKIN PIERCING FOR BLOOD,Ophyra larvae also exhibit skin-piercing blood-feeding behavior,4\n3873,DASYPHORA CYANICOLOR,FAUNA OF INDIA,Fauna of India documents the subspecies Dasyphora cyanicolor,4\n5450,DICHAETOMYIA MONTICOLA,FAUNA INDIA,\"The species Dichaetomyia monticola is referenced in the publication \"\"Fauna India\"\"\",3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
