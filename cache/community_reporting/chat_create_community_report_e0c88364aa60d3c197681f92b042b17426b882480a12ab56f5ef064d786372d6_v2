The area is recognized for its ecological significance, particularly in relation to these organisms. *Caricea odonta*, a type of sedge, is linked to NANDIAN, suggesting the region may host habitats or environmental conditions conducive to its growth. Similarly, *Phaonia longifurca*, a species of fly within the family Muscidae, is also associated with the location, indicating potential ecological interactions or research focus on its presence in the area. While the descriptions do not specify the exact nature of these associations (e.g., whether NANDIAN is a site of study, a habitat, or a point of origin for these species), the repeated mention of the location in both contexts underscores its relevance to the study or distribution of these two taxa. The combination of plant and insect associations highlights NANDIAN’s role as a site of biodiversity interest or scientific investigation within the broader ecological framework of Benxi, Liaoning.
