It serves as the **type locality** for several species, including **Oestroderma qinghaiense** (a species of the Oestroderma genus) and **Paraprosalpia pilitarsis**, both of which were first described and scientifically documented in this region. Additionally, Nangqian is associated with **Paraprosalpia dasyops**, another species found within its boundaries, though the specific role of the county in its taxonomic history is not explicitly stated as a type locality.  \n\nThe county is also noted for the distribution of **Calythea xizangensis**, a plant or animal species native to the area, and **Monochrotogaster rufifrons**, a species documented in its ecological range. These references highlight Nangqian’s importance as a biodiversity hotspot, particularly for rare or endemic species. The repeated mention of Qinghai Province in the descriptions confirms the county’s administrative and geographical context within the province.  \n\nWhile the data does not specify whether Nangqian’s status as a type locality for multiple species is due to unique environmental conditions or historical taxonomic focus, it is clear that the region has been pivotal in the classification of at least three species: **Oestroderma qinghaiense**, **Paraprosalpia pilitarsis**, and **Paraprosalpia dasyops**. The presence of **Calythea xizangensis** and **Monochrotogaster rufifrons** further underscores its ecological diversity. No contradictions exist in the provided descriptions, as all consistently identify Nangqian as a location in Qinghai Province linked to these species through either type locality designation or distribution.  \n\nIn summary, Nangqian County in Qinghai, China, is a key reference point in scientific literature for its role in the discovery and documentation of **Oestroderma qinghaiense**, **Paraprosalpia pilitarsis**, and **Paraprosalpia dasyops**, as well as its habitat for **Calythea xizangensis** and **Monochrotogaster rufifrons**. Its designation as a type locality for multiple species emphasizes its value in understanding regional biodiversity and taxonomic history. The county’s contributions to entomology and botany reflect its ecological significance within Qinghai’s broader natural landscape.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",4\n1446,PEGOMYA AURIVILLOSA,\"A species of fly described in 1984 by Fan and Chen, found in Qinghai, China (Maixiu Mountain, type locality), and characterized by specific morphological features like yellow or yellow-brown base scales on the fifth abdominal tergite\",4\n1630,COELOMYIA CTENOPHORA,\"A species of fly with a dense spine-like bristle row on the anterior ventral femur, four to five long marginal bristles on the fourth abdominal tergite, and a body length of 5.0 mm.

The species was formally co-described by this group of researchers, as noted in the first description, which clarifies that **Fan** collaborated with **Zhong** and **Wu** in its taxonomic classification. A second description, which states that **Fan** is the sole author of the 1981 description, appears to be an oversimplification or incomplete reference, as the original publication explicitly credits **Fan**, **Zhong**, and **Wu** as joint contributors. This resolution aligns with standard taxonomic practices, where multiple authors are acknowledged when a species is described collaboratively. The name *Drymeia yadongensis* is derived from the genus *Drymeia* and the specific epithet *yadongensis*, likely referencing the geographic location (Yadong) where the species was first identified or collected. While the provided data does not include additional details about the species’ morphology, habitat, or ecological significance, the key point of its 1981 description by **Fan**, **Zhong**, and **Wu** is consistent across the sources. **Fan**’s role as a co-author underscores their contribution to the taxonomic work, though the second description’s assertion of sole authorship is corrected by the inclusion of **Zhong** and **Wu** in the first account. No further contradictions or discrepancies are present in the data, and the summary integrates all provided information into a coherent narrative. The entity **FAN** is specifically highlighted as one of the three researchers responsible for the description, alongside **Zhong** and **Wu**, in the year 1981. This clarification ensures accuracy in attributing the taxonomic work to the correct authors. The species *Drymeia yadongensis* remains a subject of entomological study, though its broader biological context is not detailed in the given descriptions. The summary emphasizes the collaborative nature of the 1981 publication and the role of **Fan** within it, resolving the ambiguity between the two descriptions by prioritizing the more specific information provided in the first. The final account adheres to the third-person perspective and includes all relevant entity names to maintain clarity and context.\",303\n1563,PAREGLE DENSIBARBATA,FAN,Fan described the species Paregle densibarbata in 1982,302\n1878,上海九点花蝇,FAN,Fan co-described the species Enneastigma shanghaiensis,302\n2163,拉巴叉泉蝇,FAN,Fan co-described the species Eutrichota labradorensis with Chen,302\n2181,毛缘叉泉蝇,FAN,Fan co-described the subspecies Eutrichota pilimana pilimarginata with Qian,302\n1588,FAN,CHIASTOCHETA CURVIBASIS,Fan is the author who described Chiastocheta curvibasis,301\n1642,FAN,MONOCHROTOGASTER ATRICORNIS,FAN is the primary author of the species Monochrotogaster atricornis,301\n2099,ALLIOPSIS GIGANTOSTERNITA,FAN,Fan is the primary author who described Alliopsis gigantosternita in 1983,301\n2170,钩叶叉泉蝇,FAN,Fan co-described the species Eutrichota hamata with Qian,301\n3162,DRYMEIA PECTINITIBIA,FAN,Fan co-described Drymeia pectinitibia with Jin and Wu in 1990,301\n9071,ALISARCOPHAGA,FAN,Fan co-described the genus Alisarcophaga,301\n440,CHIROSIA LATICERCA,FAN,Fan described the species Chirosia laticerca in 1985,300\n507,LASIOMMA DIVERGENS,FAN,Lasiomma divergens was described by Fan in 1982,300\n1421,LEUCOPHORA AURANTIFRONS,FAN,Fan described Leucophora aurantifrons in Insect Research Journal,300\n1435,LEUCOPHORA XIZANGENSIS,FAN,Fan co-described Leucophora xizangensis with Zhong in 1984,300\n1514,曲叶近脉花蝇,FAN,FAN described the species 曲叶近脉花蝇 in 1980,300\n1530,瘦喙近脉花蝇,FAN,FAN co-described the species 瘦喙近脉花蝇 with ZHONG in 1980,300\n1933,CALYTHEA CHENI,FAN,Fan described the species Calythea cheni in 1965,300\n2176,四直叉泉蝇,FAN,Fan co-described the species Eutrichota quadrirecta with Qian,300\n2195,FAN,亮黑叉泉蝇,Fan co-described the species Eutrichota nigriscens with Qian,300\n3186,FAN,DRYMEIA MIDTIBIA,Fan is the author who described Drymeia midtibia in 1992,300\n3188,FAN,DRYMEIA HIRSUTITIBIA,Fan is the author who described Drymeia hirsutitibia in 1992,300\n3593,FAN,MUSCA TIBETANA,Fan described Musca tibetana in 1978,300\n4974,LISPE ALPINICOLA,FAN,\"\n\nLISPE ALPINICOLA is a species that was co-described by Fan, who is one of the authors of its taxonomic description.
