Giacomo Doria, with a brown tarsus and light brown scutellum\",3\n724,GUANGDONG,\"\n\nGuangdong, a coastal province in southern China, is a significant region for the distribution of numerous fly species across diverse genera and ecological contexts. The province is home to multiple species of parasitic and predatory flies, including *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*, and the Chinese flat-headed fly, with the latter’s type locality recorded at Xinglong Hou Gou. Notable genera documented in Guangdong include *Atherigona* (e.g., *A. reversura*, *A. yiwulushan*, and others with Taishan as a type locality), *Chrysomya* (e.g., *C. pinguis*, *C. megacephala*, *C. bezziana*), *Dichaetomyia* (species such as *Luteiventris*, *Flavocaudata*, *Pallicornis*, and *D. quadrata*), and *Helina* (e.g., *H. brunneigena* in Shantou and Zhanjiang, *H. hirtifemorata*, and *H. lateralis*). The province also hosts *Lydella grisescens*, *Musca convexifrons* (found in Conghua and Zhanjiang), *Musca crassirostris*, *Musca pilifacies*, and *Musca sorbens*, with Guangzhou and Shantou frequently cited as key locations. \n\nGuangdong’s biodiversity extends to species like *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*, *Carcelia matsukarehae*, *Carcelia ambigua*, *Carcelia lymantriae*, *Carcelia excisa*, and *Carcelia kockiana*, as well as *Graphomya rufitibia* (Guangzhou), *Peribaea orbata*, *Rhyncomya setipyga*, *Brontaea tonitrui*, *Phaonia dawushanensis*, *Pegomya bicolor*, *Dolichocolon klapperichi*, *Miltogramma iberium*, and *Caricea boops*. The region is also associated with the genus *Adia* and *Fucellia* (e.g., *F. apicalis* and *F. chinensis*), *Exorista fasciata*, *Sisyropa prominens*, *Stomorhina obsoleta*, *Tainanina* (including *T. yangchunensis*), *Haematobia minuta*, and *Dinemomyia nigribasicosta*. Specific species such as 1431家蚕追寄蝇 (translated as *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*), 紫翠蝇 (*Chrysomya megacephala* or similar), and ZONGQUAN YANGYING are documented, alongside *Myospila meditabunda brunettiana* and *Myospila meditabunda meditabunda* on coastal islands. \n\nAdditional records highlight the presence of *1393义乌亚麻蝇* (Yiwu flax fly), *Brontaea tonitrui*, *Dawuling*, and *ZONGQUAN YANGYING*, with Dianbai and other regions noted as linked to species’ presence. The province’s role as a domestic distribution hub for flies is further underscored by mentions of *Metoposisyrops scirpophagae*, *Stomoxys sitiens*, *Stomoxys uruma*, and *Hengda Jiewei Jiying* and *Shuangban Jiewei Jiying* (likely parasitic fly species). Guangdong’s ecological diversity, including cities like Zhanjiang, supports these species, with some holotypes (e.g., *Mydaea latielecta*) and type localities (e.g., Taishan for *Atherigona* species) originating there. The province is also tied to *Mydaea breviscutellata* and *Fucellia apicalis*, as well as *Hebecnema fumosa* and *Lydella grisescens*. \n\nIn summary, Guangdong serves as a critical area for entomological study, hosting a wide array of fly species across genera such as *Atherigona*, *Chrysomya*, *Dichaetomyia*, *Helina*, *Musca*, and *Carcelia*, with specific localities like Guangzhou, Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Dianbai frequently cited. Its coastal and inland habitats contribute to the presence of both native and regionally significant species, including those with agricultural or parasitic relevance. The province’s role in documenting type localities and holotypes further emphasizes its importance in understanding fly biodiversity in China.
