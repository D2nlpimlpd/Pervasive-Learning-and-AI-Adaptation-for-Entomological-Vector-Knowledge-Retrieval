Its type locality is Hequ County in the Chinese province of Shanxi, where the original specimen was collected. The species is native to China and has been documented in multiple regions across the country, including the provinces of **Jilin**, **Liaoning**, **Hebei**, and **Shanxi**. While the initial description highlighted its presence in Shanxi, subsequent records expanded its known distribution to encompass the additional provinces, indicating a broader geographic range within China. This fly belongs to the genus *Hydrotaea*, which is part of the family Muscidae, and its classification and ecological role remain consistent with the characteristics of related species in the group. No contradictory information exists in the provided data, and the summary reflects the combined details of its discovery, type locality, and current distribution.\",6\n1784,HEQU COUNTY,\"\n\nHequ County, located in Shanxi Province, China, is a region of entomological significance, serving as the type locality for *Hydrotaea bimaculatoides* and the site where *Lispe lanceoseta* was first described. The county's ecological and geographical characteristics have contributed to its role in the scientific documentation of these species. *Hydrotaea bimaculatoides*, a fly species within the genus *Hydrotaea*, is specifically noted for having its type locality established in Hequ, meaning the original specimens used to define the species were collected there. Similarly, *Lispe lanceoseta*, a member of the genus *Lispe* (family Syrphidae), was described based on observations or specimens from the same area, underscoring the county's importance in the study of syrphid flies. These associations highlight Hequ County as a key location for biodiversity research in Shanxi, particularly in the context of dipteran taxonomy. The convergence of these two species' records in the region suggests that Hequ County may harbor unique or representative habitats for such insects, though further ecological studies would be needed to confirm this. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as both align with the county's role in entomological science.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2942,HYDROTAEA BIMACULATOIDES,WANG,Wang described Hydrotaea bimaculatoides in 1981,43\n2944,HYDROTAEA BIMACULATOIDES,HEQU COUNTY,Hequ County is the type locality for Hydrotaea bimaculatoides,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
