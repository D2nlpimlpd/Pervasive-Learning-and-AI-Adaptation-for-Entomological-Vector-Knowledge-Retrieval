In 1954, Hori described the species *Sarcophaga jezensis*, *Sarcophaga kinoshitai*, and *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) kobayashii*, the latter of which was later reclassified under the subgenus *Liosarcophaga*. The same year, Hori also contributed to the taxonomy of the *Takanoa* genus by describing *Takanoa hakusana*. In 1955, Hori expanded their work by describing *Sarcophaga oitana*, a species associated with the genus *Horia* (as noted in the description of *Horia oitana*). Additionally, Hori is credited with describing the species *Horiisca hozawai* in 1954, a genus name derived from their own name, reflecting their significant role in its classification. These contributions highlight Hori’s expertise in entomology, particularly in the study of flies (Diptera), and their impact on the nomenclature and classification of species within genera such as *Sarcophaga*, *Parasarcophaga*, *Takanoa*, and *Horiisca*. The descriptions of *Parasarcophaga kobayashii* and *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) kobayashii* appear to reference the same species, with the subgenus *Liosarcophaga* added in a later taxonomic revision.
