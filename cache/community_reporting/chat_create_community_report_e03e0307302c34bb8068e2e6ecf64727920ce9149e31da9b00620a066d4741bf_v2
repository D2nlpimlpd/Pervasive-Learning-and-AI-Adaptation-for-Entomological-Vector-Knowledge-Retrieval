It is notable for its role in documenting the description of the species *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (a Chinese name for a specific fly species, likely referring to a taxonomic entry or catalog number). The species was formally described in Volume 15 of the journal, specifically on page 191, as indicated in the provided data. This journal, while not explicitly detailed in the descriptions, is inferred to be a specialized academic publication focused on entomological studies, given its name and the context of species documentation. The mention of *1396犁头亚麻蝇* in the journal highlights its contribution to taxonomic research, particularly in cataloging or characterizing lesser-known or newly identified insect species. The entity \"\"REV.D’ENTOMOLOGIE\"\" appears to be a primary source for entomological literature, with the specific reference to Volume 15:191 underscoring its historical or ongoing significance in the field. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as both align in identifying the journal as the venue for the species' publication and specifying the volume and page number. The journal’s role in entomology is further implied by its name, which translates to \"\"Review of Entomology\"\" or \"\"Journal of Entomology,\"\" suggesting it publishes peer-reviewed articles, taxonomic revisions, or observational studies on insects. While the descriptions do not provide additional context about the journal’s scope, editorial focus, or publication history beyond the *1396犁头亚麻蝇* entry, the information collectively establishes REV.D’ENTOMOLOGIE as a scientific resource for entomological research, with a documented contribution to the classification of this particular fly species. The species name *1396犁头亚麻蝇* may correspond to a formal taxonomic designation or a regional/localized identifier, though further details about its classification, habitat, or significance are not included in the provided data. The journal’s use of volume and page numbers (Vol.15:191) indicates a structured publication format typical of academic journals, which aids in locating specific research contributions. Overall, REV.D’ENTOMOLOGIE is positioned as a key entity in the entomological community, with a documented role in advancing knowledge through the publication of species descriptions and related studies.\",1\n5307,GUOYUAN,\"Location in Inner Mongolia, China, associated with 1396犁头亚麻蝇.>\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10143,1396犁头亚麻蝇,PANDELLE,\"\n\nThe entity **1396犁头亚麻蝇** is a species of fly, and the entity **PANDELLE** refers to the individual who first described this species in 1896.
