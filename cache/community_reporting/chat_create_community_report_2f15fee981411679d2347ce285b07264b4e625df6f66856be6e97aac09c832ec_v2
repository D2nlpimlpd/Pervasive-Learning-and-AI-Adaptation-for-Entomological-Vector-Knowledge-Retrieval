These two groups, *Exorista japonica* and the *Horiisca* genus, are both part of the biodiversity and ecological distribution patterns observed in this area. The presence of *Exorista japonica*, a species likely associated with specific habitats or ecosystems, highlights the region's role in supporting its population. Similarly, the *Horiisca* genus, which may include multiple species, contributes to the biological diversity of East China, indicating the area's suitability for their survival and proliferation. While the descriptions do not specify the exact habitats or interactions between these groups, they collectively underscore East China's significance as a geographical and ecological zone for these organisms. The region's environmental conditions, such as climate, vegetation, or water availability, are presumably favorable for both the *Exorista japonica* and the *Horiisca* genus, though further details on their ecological roles or conservation status are not provided in the data.
