Established in **1957**, the institute has been associated with studies on **Achoetandrus rufifacies**, a species of fly, as part of its broader focus on parasitic organisms and their ecological or medical implications. However, prior to its formal establishment, the institute conducted research on **Calliphora axata**, another blowfly species, in **1956**, indicating early engagement in entomological investigations. These studies likely contributed to the institute’s foundational work in understanding parasitic life cycles, host interactions, or vector-borne diseases, particularly in the context of Chinese biodiversity or public health. The mention of both species—**Achoetandrus rufifacies** and **Calliphora axata**—suggests a research scope that includes multiple insect taxa, potentially emphasizing their roles as vectors or hosts for parasites. While the 1956 and 1957 dates appear to reflect distinct projects, the 1956 research on *Calliphora axata* may have been an early initiative that informed the institute’s later establishment and specialization in 1957. The institute’s location in **Nanjing** positions it within a region historically significant for biological and medical research in China. Its work on these specific fly species highlights a focus on parasitic relationships, ecological studies, or applications in disease control, though further details on methodologies or outcomes are not provided in the descriptions. Overall, the **PARASITE RESEARCH INSTITUTE** serves as a key institution in the study of parasitic organisms and their associated insect hosts, with documented contributions to research on *Achoetandrus rufifacies* and *Calliphora axata* in the late 1950s. The slight discrepancy in dates (1956 vs. 1957) is resolved by interpreting the 1956 activity as a precursor to the institute’s formal founding in 1957, aligning with the timeline of its research initiatives.\",2\n2131,INSTITUTE OF PARASITOLOGY IN NANJING,\"Research institution in Nanjing, Jiangsu, associated with 1956 studies\",1\n4094,SHANGHAI HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,Institution that collected Phormia regina specimens in Shanghai in June 1960,2\n4096,PROTOSCALLIPHORA AZUREA,Fly species associated with the Nanjing Parasitic Disease Institute's 1957 collection,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n7723,MEIGEN,PHORMIA REGINA,Meigen described the species Phormia regina,125\n9628,NANJING,1349 SLENDER-LEAF PIERRETIAS,The species is distributed in Nanjing city,21\n7749,NANJING PARASITIC DISEASE INSTITUTE,NANJING,Nanjing Parasitic Disease Institute is associated with Nanjing's 1957 collection,12\n7624,PARASITE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,NANJING,The Parasite Research Institute is located in Nanjing,11\n3623,INSTITUTE OF PARASITOLOGY IN NANJING,NANJING,\"Institute of Parasitology is located in Nanjing, Jiangsu\",10\n7748,SHANGHAI HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,PHORMIA REGINA,Phormia regina specimens were collected by Shanghai Health and Epidemic Prevention Station in 1960,6\n7751,NANJING PARASITIC DISEASE INSTITUTE,PROTOSCALLIPHORA AZUREA,Protoscalliphora azurea is linked to Nanjing Parasitic Disease Institute's 1957 collection,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
