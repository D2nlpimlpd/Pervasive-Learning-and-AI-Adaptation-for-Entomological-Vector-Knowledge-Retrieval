It is characterized by distinct T-shaped black median stripes on the abdominal tergites, a feature that distinguishes it from other members of its genus. The fly also possesses a white alula, a small lobe on the hind leg, which further aids in identification. Morphologically, it has a body length of approximately 4 mm, as noted in taxonomic records. \n\nThe species is distributed in two primary regions: domestically in Shanxi Province, China, specifically in the city of Taiyuan, and internationally in the Alps of Europe, where it was first identified as the type locality. These geographic ranges suggest a possible adaptation to temperate and alpine environments, though specific ecological preferences remain undocumented in the provided data. \n\nBoth descriptions confirm the T-shaped black stripes on abdominal segments (tergites) and the presence of a white alula as defining traits. The first description adds the body length of 4 mm, while the second emphasizes the distribution in Shanxi and the Alps. No contradictions exist between the two sources, as they align on key morphological and geographic details. The summary integrates all provided information to present a cohesive overview of Leucophora dorsalis, highlighting its taxonomic history, physical features, and known habitats.\",8\n1471,PEGOMYA CENTAUREEODES,\"A species of Pegomya fly described by Hsue in 1981.

Hosts include Saussurea genus plants.\",4\n613,ALPS,\"\n\nThe Alps are a major mountain range in Europe, spanning multiple countries including Austria, Switzerland, and Italy. They serve as a significant geographical and ecological region, hosting a variety of species with documented associations. The type locality for *Strobilomyia laricicola* is specifically situated in the Austrian Alps, while *Syllegopterula beckeri* is found along the Switzerland-Italy border within the range. *Delia longicauda* is also noted to have the Alps as its type locality, though the exact subregion is not specified. Similarly, *Pegohylemyia sanctimarci* is associated with the Alps, though no further details on its distribution within the range are provided. The species *Cynomya mortuorum* is distributed across the broader Alpine region, and the Alps are recognized as the type locality for *Leucophora dorsalis* (with slight redundancy in descriptions corrected to reflect this once). Additionally, the Alps in Europe are the type locality for *Pegomya valgenovensis*. Collectively, these references highlight the Alps as a critical area for biodiversity, with specific species linked to distinct subregions such as Austria or the Switzerland-Italy border, while others are tied to the mountain range as a whole. The descriptions are harmonized to emphasize the Alps’ role as both a general European mountain system and a specific habitat for these taxa, resolving minor inconsistencies in phrasing (e.g., \"\"A mountain range in Austria\"\" vs. \"\"Europe\"\") by clarifying the broader context of the Alps as a transnational range.
