It hosts a wide array of dipteran fauna, including species such as *Atherigona reversura*, *Atherigona bidens*, *Atherigona yiwulushan*, and *Atherigona biseta*, as well as *Metopia argyrocephala* and *Metopia sauteri* (type locality: Dazukou). The region is also home to *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Carcelia kockiana*, *Calliphora nigribarbis*, and *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis*. Notably, several *Dichaetomyia* species, including *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, are found in cities like Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Tainan, while *Tainanina pilisquama* and *Tainanina sarcophagoides* are specifically recorded there.  \n\nAmong the notable species are *Chrysomya pinguis*, *Chrysomya megacephala*, and *Chrysomya bezziana*, distributed in areas such as Xinzhu, Fenglin, and Kenting. The genus *Phaonia* includes *Phaonia villana* and *Phaonia fuscata*, with the latter documented in Tainan. *Musca* species like *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca crassirostris*, *Musca conducens*, and *Musca pilifacies* are also present, alongside *Stomoxys sitiens* and *Stomoxys uruma*. The region serves as the type locality for *Limnophora tigrina tigrina* and *Sarcorohdendorfia antilope* and *Sarcorohdendorfia mimobasalis*.  \n\nTaiwan supports multiple *Myospila* species, including *Myospila laevis*, *Myospila meditabunda brunettiana*, and *Myospila meditabunda meditabunda*, as well as *Isomyia isomyia*, *Isomyia electa*, and *Isomyia mandarina*. The genus *Hylemya* and *Sinohylemya* are recorded, with *Hylemya* species found in various locations. *Hydrotaea jacobsoni* and *Hydrotaea affinis* are distributed domestically, and *Hydrotaea occulta* is also present. Additionally, *Lasiopelta longicornis*, *Hebecnema fumosa*, and *Strongyloneura prasina* are documented, along with *Exorista jugoslavica* and *Austrophorocera*.  \n\nThe region is associated with the distribution of *Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri* and *Bengalia taiwanensis*, as well as *Paradichosia crinitarsis* and *Paradichosia nigricans*. *Anthomyia illocata* and *Anthomyia plumiseta* are found there, and *Lispe odessae* and *Pegomya bicolor* (type locality) are also reported. *Pygophora respondens*, *Pectiniseta pectinata*, and *Pygophora maculipennis* are part of the local biodiversity, as are *Xenotachina zhibenensis* and *Xenotachina fumifemoralis*.  \n\nTaiwan’s ecological diversity is further highlighted by the presence of *Neomyia* species, *Sarcosolomonia* species, *Sisyropa prominens*, and *Haematobia*. Fly larvae have been observed in animal corpses, indicating ecological roles in decomposition. The region is also linked to the domestic distribution of *Muscidae* subfamilies and the genus *Winthemia*. Specific localities like Leye, Nanyu Forestry Experimental Station, and Taiping Mountain are noted for species such as *Graphomya rufitibia* (type locality: Chiayi) and *Hemipyrellia liguriens*.  \n\nIn summary, Taiwan, a province in China, is a critical hub for fly biodiversity, encompassing over 40 species and genera across its cities and natural areas. Its role as a type locality for several species underscores its importance in entomological research. The region’s varied ecosystems support both common and endemic fly populations, contributing to China’s broader faunal diversity. Key cities like Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Tainan frequently appear in distribution records, reflecting localized ecological niches.
