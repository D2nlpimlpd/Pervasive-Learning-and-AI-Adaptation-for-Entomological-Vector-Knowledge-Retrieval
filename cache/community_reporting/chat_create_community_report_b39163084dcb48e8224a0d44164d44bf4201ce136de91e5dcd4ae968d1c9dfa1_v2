This fly is notable for its ecological association with human-altered environments, particularly garbage and human food sources, which it frequents for feeding and breeding. The type locality for *Calliphora vomitoria* is Sweden, where it was originally identified and classified. Despite its specific origin, the species exhibits a widespread distribution, occurring across various regions beyond its native range. As a member of the Calliphoridae family, *Calliphora vomitoria* is part of a group of flies often recognized for their role in decomposition and forensic entomology. Its common name, \"\"Regurgitating Calliphora,\"\" may allude to behaviors such as regurgitating food to soften it, a trait observed in some blowfly species. The combination of its historical taxonomic significance, ecological habits tied to anthropogenic waste, and broad geographic presence underscores its dual role as both a scientific reference and a potential indicator of human environmental impact.\",4\n3775,SWEEDEN,Sweden is the type locality for the Ural Calliphora (Calliphora uralensis) and a foreign distribution location for the Regurgitating Calliphora (Calliphora vomitoria),2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n6952,CALLIPHORA VOMITORIA,LINNAEUS,Linnaeus described the species Calliphora vomitoria,35\n7002,SWEEDEN,CALLIPHORA VOMITORIA,Sweden is the type locality for the Regurgitating Calliphora,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
