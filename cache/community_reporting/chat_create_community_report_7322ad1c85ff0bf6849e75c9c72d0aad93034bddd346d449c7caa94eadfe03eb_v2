It serves as a domestic distribution location for multiple genera and species, including *Helina ciliata*, *Helina bohemani* (specifically in Jingyuan), *Helina nudifemorata latiscissa*, *Helina hirtifemorata*, *Helina hirsutitibia*, *Helina brunneipalpis*, and *Helina trivittata* (found at Longde). The region is also home to *Tachina albidopilosa* and *Tachina noctuarum*, the latter of which parasitizes the Poplar Defoliator. *Musca autumnalis* (autumn housefly), *Musca conducens*, and *Musca tempestiva* are recorded in Ningxia, alongside *Haematobia* (horn fly) and *Delia latissima* (a species of fruit fly).  \n\nNingxia hosts several *Parasarcophaga* species, such as *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni*, *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Parasarcophaga aegyptica*, and *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata*. The genus *Periscepsia* is represented by *Periscepsia carbonaria*, while *Hydrotaea mimopilipes* and *Hydrotaea palaestrica* (notably in Longde) are also present. *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Helicophagella maculata*, and *I. tripartita* are among the other species documented in the region.  \n\nGeographically, Ningxia’s biodiversity is highlighted by studies in areas like the Helan Mountains, Luoshan, and Tongxin, where species such as 紫翠蝇 (*Zicui fly*) and 绿翠蝇 (*Lücuí fly*) have been observed. Specific localities, including Yinchuan (where *Phormia regina* is found) and Liupan Mountain (home to *Helina intermedia*), further illustrate the region’s ecological significance. The presence of *Sarcophaga semenovi* and *Sarcophaga aegyptica* underscores Ningxia’s role in the distribution of blowflies, while *Adia* (a genus of flies) and *Mydaea tinctoscutaris* add to its taxonomic diversity.  \n\nNingxia’s status as an autonomous region within China is emphasized in its entomological records, with species like *Xylotachina diluta* noted for parasitizing an unnamed wood borer. The region’s role in supporting both native and potentially invasive species, such as *Helina hirtifemorata* and *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata*, reflects its ecological complexity. Overall, Ningxia is a critical area for studying fly biodiversity, with multiple species and genera documented across its varied landscapes, including mountainous and agricultural zones. This summary consolidates all provided data, resolving minor redundancies (e.g., repeated mentions of *Tachina albidopilosa* and *Hydrotaea palaestrica*) and emphasizing the region’s importance as a hub for entomological research in China.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",37\n1805,ZHAO GAN,\"Person who collected the holotype of Hydrotaea mimopilipes in Jingyuan, Ningxia\",2\n3191,HELINA CILIATA,\"A species of fly described by Karl in 1929, found in Hebei and Ningxia (Jingyuan).
