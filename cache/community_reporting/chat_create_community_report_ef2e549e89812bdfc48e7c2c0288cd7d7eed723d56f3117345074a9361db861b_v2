In addition to its core public health functions, the center serves as a repository for significant biological specimens, including holotype and type specimens of the fly species *Phaonia gulianensis* and *Phaonia apicaloides*. A holotype is the single physical example of an organism used to formally describe and name a species, while a type specimen refers to the same concept in taxonomic nomenclature. The center preserves the holotype of *Phaonia gulianensis* (which is also its type specimen) and the holotype of *Phaonia apicaloides*, both of which are critical for entomological classification and identification. These specimens, collected and curated by the institution, provide a foundational reference for researchers studying the taxonomy, ecology, and evolutionary relationships of these species. The inclusion of both species in the center’s collection underscores its role in documenting regional biodiversity and supporting scientific studies related to arthropod taxonomy. While the institution’s primary mission focuses on public health, its contribution to preserving type specimens highlights its broader engagement in biological sciences, particularly in the context of entomology. The specimens are likely housed in a dedicated entomology or zoology collection, maintained under standardized conditions to ensure their long-term viability for research. This dual role in public health and specimen preservation reflects the center’s commitment to both human health and the advancement of scientific knowledge. The presence of these holotypes also emphasizes Liaoning Province’s ecological significance as a region where these species were first described, contributing to the global understanding of their distribution and characteristics.
