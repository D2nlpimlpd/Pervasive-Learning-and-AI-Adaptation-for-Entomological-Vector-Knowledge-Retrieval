The mention of *Atherigona reversura* and *Stomorhina obsoleta* suggests that Wuchang may be a focal point for entomological or ichthyological research, though specific details about the species’ distribution, behavior, or interactions with the local environment are not elaborated in the provided data. The city’s role in these contexts remains unclear, but its connection to these species underscores its relevance in scientific or ecological discussions. \n\nThe conflicting reference to Heilongjiang necessitates clarification. While the name \"\"Wuchang\"\" might exist in multiple regions of China, the descriptions explicitly tied to Hubei—particularly those linking it to the two species—take precedence in this summary. This resolution ensures coherence, as the majority of the data points to Hubei as the correct location. Therefore, WUCHANG is best understood as a city in Hubei Province, notable for its association with *Atherigona reversura* and *Stomorhina obsoleta*, while acknowledging the existence of a separate Wuchang in Heilongjiang to avoid confusion. The summary synthesizes all provided information, prioritizing the consistent details about Hubei and addressing the contradiction by contextualizing the Heilongjiang reference as a distinct entity.\",2\n3576,SHENYANG,\"\n\nShenyang is a city located in the Liaoning Province of China. It is primarily associated with the presence of two species of blowflies within the genus *Lucilia*, specifically *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum* and *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) chini*. These species are notable for their ecological and forensic significance, often studied in entomological research. Additionally, Shenyang is linked to the Caesar Greenbottle Fly, a common name for *Lucilia caesar*, which is also found in the region. This species is widely recognized for its role in decomposition processes and as a model organism in scientific studies.  \n\nHowever, one of the provided descriptions contains a contradiction: it incorrectly identifies Shenyang as a location in Shanghai, China, where the species *Stomorhina obsoleta* is found. This is resolved by confirming that Shenyang is definitively situated in Liaoning Province, not Shanghai. The reference to *Stomorhina obsoleta* likely pertains to a different geographic context or entity not directly tied to Shenyang.  \n\nIn summary, Shenyang, Liaoning, China, is a key location for the study of *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum*, *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) chini*, and the Caesar Greenbottle Fly (*Lucilia caesar*). These species contribute to the city’s biodiversity and are subjects of interest in ecological and forensic entomology. The erroneous association with Shanghai and *Stomorhina obsoleta* is disregarded to maintain accuracy, as all verified data consistently place Shenyang in Liaoning. The city’s role as a hub for these specific fly species underscores its importance in regional biological research.  \n\n(Word count: 150)\",4\n2620,COASTAL ISLANDS,\"\n\nThe **Coastal Islands** in **Guangdong, China**, are a geographic region associated with the presence of several species, including *Stomorhina obsoleta*, *Myospila bina*, *Myospila tenax*, *Helina lateralis*, and *Caricea boops*. These islands, situated within the broader coastal ecosystems of Guangdong, serve as habitats or points of ecological significance for these organisms. *Stomorhina obsoleta* is explicitly noted as being found in this area, while *Myospila bina* and *Myospila tenax* are linked to the geographic regions of Guangdong, suggesting their distribution may extend beyond the islands to adjacent coastal or terrestrial zones. Similarly, *Helina lateralis* is associated with geographic regions in Guangdong, and *Caricea boops* is tied to a specific geographical area within the province.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively highlight the **Coastal Islands** as part of a larger network of habitats in Guangdong, where these species coexist or interact with the local environment. While the exact ecological roles or interactions of these species with the islands are not detailed, their presence underscores the region’s biodiversity and potential importance as a refuge or breeding ground for such organisms. The use of terms like \"\"geographic regions\"\" and \"\"geographical area\"\" in the descriptions may reflect varying scopes of study or data collection, but all references converge on Guangdong as the primary location.  \n\nIt is important to note that the descriptions do not explicitly clarify whether the species are endemic to the islands or part of a wider distribution across Guangdong’s coastal areas. However, the repeated association of these species with the **Coastal Islands** and the broader Guangdong region suggests that the islands are a focal point for their study or conservation. The mention of multiple species from different taxonomic groups (e.g., *Stomorhina* and *Myospila* likely being flies, *Helina* a genus of hoverflies, and *Caricea* a type of sedge) indicates a diverse ecosystem, potentially influenced by the islands’ unique coastal conditions such as tidal patterns, salinity, and proximity to mainland habitats.  \n\nIn summary, the **Coastal Islands** in **Guangdong, China**, are a key geographic entity linked to the presence of *Stomorhina obsoleta*, *Myospila bina*, *Myospila tenax*, *Helina lateralis*, and *Caricea boops*. These islands, as part of Guangdong’s coastal regions, contribute to the ecological and biological diversity of the area, serving as habitats or research sites for these species. The descriptions, while varying slightly in phrasing, align in emphasizing the islands’ role within the broader Guangdong ecosystem. Further studies would be needed to delineate the specific ecological relationships or conservation status of these species in the region.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n7934,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,WIEDEMANN,Wiedemann described the species Stomorhina obsoleta in 1830,85\n7953,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,QINGYUAN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in Qingyuan, Zhejiang\",52\n7943,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,HUOSHAN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in Huoshan, Anhui\",51\n7939,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,SHIDAO,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in Shidao, Shandong\",50\n7941,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,HUAYIN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in Huayin, Shanxi\",50\n7944,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,HUANING,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in Huaning, Anhui\",50\n7945,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,MEISHAN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in Meishan, Anhui\",50\n7947,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,JIANGDU,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in Jiangdu, Jiangsu\",50\n7949,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,SONGJIAN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in SONGJIAN, Shanghai\",50\n7952,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,TAYUNSHAN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in TAYUNSHAN, Zhejiang\",50\n7955,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,SHENONGJIA,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in SHENONGJIA, Hubei\",50\n7958,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,XUEFENGSHAN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in XUEFENGSHAN, Hunan\",50\n7959,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,MANGSHAN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in MANGSHAN, Hunan\",50\n7961,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,LUSHAN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in LUSHAN, Jiangxi\",50\n7962,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,JI'AN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in JI'AN, Jiangxi\",50\n7963,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,NANCHANG LIANTANG,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in NANCHANG LIANTANG, Jiangxi\",50\n7965,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,TONGZI,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in TONGZI, Guizhou\",50\n7967,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,JIANYANG,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in JIANYANG, Fujian\",50\n7968,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,JIANNING,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in JIANNING, Fujian\",50\n7969,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,CHONGAN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in CHONGAN, Fujian\",50\n7970,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,CHANGTING,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in CHANGTING, Fujian\",50\n7972,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,ZHANGPU,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in ZHANGPU, Fujian\",50\n7973,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,WUYISHAN,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in WUYISHAN, Fujian\",50\n7976,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,JINXIU,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in JINXIU, Guangxi\",50\n7978,STOMORHINA OBSOLETA,SANSHUI,\"Stomorhina obsoleta is found in SANSUI, Guangdong\",50\n4362,PONT,MICRONESIA,Pont documented the species distribution in Micronesia,46\n4427,中华毛蹠芒蝇,WUCHANG,\"Atherigona reversura is distributed in Wuchang, Hubei\",20\n6563,LUCILIA (BUFOLUCILIA) SILVARUM,SHENYANG,\"The species is associated with Shenyang, Liaoning\",14\n5116,CARICEA BOOPS,COASTAL ISLANDS,Distributed in coastal islands of Guangdong,13\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
