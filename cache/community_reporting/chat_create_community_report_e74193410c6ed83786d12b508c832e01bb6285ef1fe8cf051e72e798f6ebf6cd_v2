It is documented as a foreign or native habitat for a wide array of taxa, including **毛腹绿蝇** (*Musca abdominalis*), **毛尾绿蝇** (*Musca caudata*), **Protocalliphora azurea**, **Protocalliphora chrysorrhoea**, and **Phormiata** species. The USSR is also associated with the **Tricycleopsis paradoxa** distribution, as well as the **大洋翠蝇** (*Neomyia (Orthellia) laevifrons*), which was found in the Far East region. \n\nIn Siberia, the USSR hosted **Sarcophila rasnitzyni**, while the **Phallocheira minor** was specifically noted in the Primorsky Krai region, which served as its type locality. The **Mesembrina** genus, including species like **斑腿透翅寄蝇** (*Mesembrina festiva*), was distributed across Siberia and Primorsky Krai. The Far East region of the USSR was also a key area for **Phaonia halterata** and **棕翅阳蝇** (*Chrysomya pinguis*), and the **Dasyphora** species were recorded there. \n\nThe USSR’s sheep-raising areas, excluding northern regions, were home to **Oestrus ovis**, a botfly species. Additionally, it was a foreign distribution location for **Hypoderma lineatum** and **Hypoderma diana** (botflies affecting cattle and horses), as well as for **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa**, whose type locality is in southern France. The country is referenced as a distribution range for **Blaesoxipha** species, **Rypellia** species (including the Crimean Peninsula and Caucasus), **Gasterophilus** species (botflies of equines), and **Servaisia mixta**, the latter with its type locality in the USSR. \n\nThe USSR’s geographical expanse included habitats for **1287肿额潘麻蝇** (*Panopsia sp.*), **巨尾阿丽蝇** (*Aldrichina magnicauda*), **叉丽蝇** (*Aldrichina sp.*), and **紫鼻狂蝇** (*Oestrus nasalis*), **宽额鼻狂蝇** (*Oestrus latifrons*), and **亚非鼻狂蝇** (*Oestrus africanus*), which were found in regions such as the European part, Transbaikal, southern Siberia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The **斑麻蝇属** (*Blaesoxipha*) was distributed in the USSR’s European territories, Caucasus, Central Asia, and Far East. \n\nNotable species with specific regional ties include **Exorista rossica** in Tajikistan, **高鼻泉种蝇** (*Hippelates sp.*) in mountainous areas, and **1287肿额潘麻蝇** in Central Asia. The USSR is also linked to the **兔裸皮蝇** (*Cuterebra leporina*) and **牛皮蝇** (*Hypoderma bovis*), as well as **高山泉种蝇** (*Hippelates sp.*), **陈氏污蝇** (*Musca cheni*), **介污蝇** (*Musca intermedia*), **亚西污蝇** (*Musca yasui*), and **巴彦污蝇** (*Musca bayanensis*). \n\nThe country’s historical role as a distribution hub for these species is underscored by its inclusion in taxonomic records as a \"\"foreign distribution area\"\" for several genera, such as **Rypellia**, **Phormiata**, and **Phaonia**, and as a type locality for **Servaisia mixta**. The USSR’s diverse ecosystems, from the European plains to the remote Far East and Siberian tundra, supported a broad range of fly species, many of which are now studied across its successor states, including Russia, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan.

First, they are cited in 1965 for their taxonomic work on *Rypellia*, a genus of moths, indicating their contribution to the classification or study of this group during that period. Second, Fan is described as a person who referenced a 1965 study in their own text, suggesting they engaged with scholarly work published in the same year. These accounts do not conflict but rather highlight two roles: Fan as an author of taxonomic research on *Rypellia* in 1965 and as a scholar who incorporated findings from a 1965 study into their writing.
