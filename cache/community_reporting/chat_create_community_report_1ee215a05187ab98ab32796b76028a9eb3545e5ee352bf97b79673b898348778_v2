The descriptions provided highlight its geographical and biological significance, though one mentions **Shanxi Province** instead of Shaanxi, likely a typographical error. The Qinling Mountains are a major natural feature in central China, forming a boundary between the northern and southern regions of the country. They are ecologically and culturally important, supporting diverse ecosystems and serving as a critical habitat for various species, including *Phaonia vulpinus*, a fly species first documented in this area. The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the specific geographic location where a species is first identified and described, making the Qinling Mountains a key reference site for taxonomic studies of *Phaonia vulpinus*. While one description incorrectly associates Qinling with Shanxi, the majority of sources and scientific consensus align with its established location in Shaanxi. This clarification ensures accuracy in understanding the region's role in biodiversity research. The Qinling Mountains are also notable for their historical and environmental importance, acting as a traditional divide between China's northern and southern climates and ecosystems. Their inclusion in the context of *Phaonia vulpinus* underscores the area's value in entomological studies. In summary, **QINLING** is a mountain range in **Shaanxi, China**, renowned for its ecological diversity and as the type locality for *Phaonia vulpinus*, with the conflicting reference to Shanxi resolved in favor of the widely accepted Shaanxi location.\",2\n3413,PHAOINIA VULPINUS,\"Fly species described in 1988 by Wu, Fang, and Fan with type locality in Qinling, Shaanxi\",6\n3409,J.
