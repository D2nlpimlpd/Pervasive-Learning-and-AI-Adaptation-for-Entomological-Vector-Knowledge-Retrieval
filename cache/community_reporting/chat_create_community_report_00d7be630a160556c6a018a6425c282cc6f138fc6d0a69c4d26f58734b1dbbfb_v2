The province hosts a wide array of insects, including **Atherigona yiwulushan**, **Lydella grisescens**, **Musca autumnalis**, **Musca convexifrons** (notably in Qingdao and Jinan), and **Parasarcophaga jacobsoni** and **Parasarcophaga albiceps**. It is also a domestic location for the genus **Adia** and the *FLY GENUS*, though the latter is unspecified. Specific species such as **Parasarcophaga brevicornis**, **Carcelia matsukarehae**, **Cuphocera varia**, and **Calliphora axata** (recorded in Qingdao and Xu Cheng) are documented within its borders.  \n\nShandong’s cities and regions, including **Jinan**, **Qingdao**, **Taishan**, **Heze**, **Laoshan**, and **Shida**, are highlighted as habitats for various species. For instance, **Graphomya rufitibia** is found in Jinan and Qingdao, while the *THICK RING BLACK FLY* (likely a descriptive name for a species) is distributed in Taishan and Heze. The province is also home to **Gonia bimaculata**, **Gonia chinensis** (notably in Qingdao), and **Purple Greenbottle Fly** (紫翠蝇). Additionally, **Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) jacobsoni** has been recorded in Laoshan and Shida, and **Muscina** is associated with **Mount Tai**.  \n\nGenera with documented presence in Shandong include **Bellardia** (e.g., *B. menechmoides* in Jinan and *B. nartshukae*), **Bercaea** (*B. cruentata*), **Lispe** (*L. monochaita* and *L. melaleuca*), **Phormia** (*P. regina* in Jinan), **Stomorhina** (*S. obsoleta*), **Winthemia**, **Hoa**, and **Chaetexorista ateripalpis**. The province supports species like **Polleniopsis mongolica**, **I. mandarina**, **I. tripartita**, **Heteronychia tsinanensis**, and **Haematobia**. Notably, **Musca conducens** and **Musca sorbens** are also part of its fly fauna.  \n\nShandong serves as a domestic distribution region for **Fucellia apicalis** and **Fucellia chinensis**, as well as **Exorista fasciata** and **Calythea cheni**. The genus **Parasarcophaga** is further represented by *P. polystylata*. While some descriptions refer to \"\"the species\"\" without specific names, the cumulative data underscores Shandong’s ecological significance as a hub for multiple fly genera and species, including both common and regionally unique taxa.  \n\nThe province’s biodiversity is further enriched by the presence of **Miltogramma iberium** and **1339上海细麻蝇** (a species likely related to the *Chrysomya* or *Lucilia* genera, though the \"\"1339上海\"\" prefix may indicate a misclassification or regional variant). The **Brown-tailed Blow Fly** (棕尾别麻蝇) is also noted as a domestic inhabitant.  \n\nIn summary, Shandong is a critical region in China for the distribution of diverse fly species and genera, with specific localities like Qingdao, Jinan, and Mount Tai playing notable roles. Its entomological profile includes both widespread and localized species, reflecting the province’s varied ecosystems and climatic conditions. The data collectively establishes Shandong as a significant area for studying fly biodiversity and ecological dynamics in China.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",47\n2077,QINGDAO,\"\n\nQingdao is a city located in Shandong province, China, as consistently noted across all provided descriptions.

The city’s significance in biological contexts is further underscored by its role in the documentation of these two species, which are linked to its regional environment. While the descriptions primarily emphasize Qingdao’s administrative and geographic identity as a coastal city in Shandong, the specific references to *Pierrettia tsintaoensis* and *Calliphora axata* highlight its importance in scientific research and biodiversity records.
