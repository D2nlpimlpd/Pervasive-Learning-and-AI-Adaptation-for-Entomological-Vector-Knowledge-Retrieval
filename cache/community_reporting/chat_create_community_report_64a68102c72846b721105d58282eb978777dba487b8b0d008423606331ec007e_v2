Body length 8.5 mm.>\",6\n1122,VAN,\"\n\nVAN is a researcher associated with the co-description of two distinct species in the field of entomology. In 1980, VAN collaborated with Fan and Ma to describe *瘦叶近脉花蝇* (a species of fly, likely related to the genus *Protoplasmodium* or a similar group, though the exact taxonomic classification is not specified in the provided data). This contribution highlights VAN’s involvement in taxonomic work, particularly in documenting biodiversity within dipteran insects. Additionally, VAN is listed as a co-author of the species *青海丽蝇* (*Calliphora (Acrophaga) chinghaiensis*), a blowfly species belonging to the genus *Calliphora* and subgenus *Acrophaga*. The description of *Calliphora (Acrophaga) chinghaiensis* further underscores VAN’s expertise in forensic or ecological entomology, as blowflies are often studied for their roles in decomposition processes or as indicators of environmental conditions. While the first description explicitly notes the 1980 collaboration, the second does not specify a publication date, leaving the timeline of this latter contribution unclear. Both works, however, reflect VAN’s role in advancing the understanding of fly species, particularly in regions such as China, where *青海丽蝇* is likely endemic. The lack of additional details about VAN’s broader research or institutional affiliations in the provided data limits a more comprehensive overview, but the two co-authored species descriptions establish a clear connection to taxonomic studies in dipterology. The collaboration with Fan and Ma appears to be a recurring partnership, suggesting a shared focus on entomological research during the period of these publications. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they reference separate species and contexts. VAN’s contributions, though limited to these two examples in the given data, demonstrate a commitment to documenting and classifying insect biodiversity.\",2\n3763,青海丽蝇CALLIPHORA (ACROPHAGA) CHINGHAIENSIS,,3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1524,瘦叶近脉花蝇,FAN,FAN co-described the species 瘦叶近脉花蝇 with VAN and MA in 1980,301\n6977,VAN,青海丽蝇CALLIPHORA (ACROPHAGA) CHINGHAIENSIS,Van is a co-author of the species 青海丽蝇,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
