This individual is specifically noted for their work in collecting adult specimens of the species across diverse ecological settings, including orchards, forests, cultivated lands, grasslands, animal carcasses, sheep pens, and indoor environments. The study, which focused on the biology, distribution, or behavior of *Eudasyphora cyanicolor*, was likely part of entomological research in the Xinjiang region, where the researcher's fieldwork involved systematic sampling in both natural and human-modified habitats. The 1981 citation highlights their contribution to understanding the species' ecological preferences and potential interactions with agricultural or pastoral systems, given the inclusion of sites like sheep pens and cultivated areas. While the exact findings of the study are not detailed, the breadth of collection locations suggests a comprehensive approach to documenting the fly's habitat range and life cycle. The entity \"\"钱\"\" thus represents a scholar whose work in the early 1980s advanced knowledge of *Eudasyphora cyanicolor* in China, particularly in Xinjiang, through field-based research and taxonomic analysis. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both emphasize the researcher's role in the 1981 study and their field collection activities. The summary integrates these details to reflect their contributions to entomology in the specified region and timeframe.\"\"  \n\n(Word count: 150)\",5\n358,西藏,\"\n\nTibet (西藏), an autonomous region in China, serves as a significant distribution area for various fly species. It is noted as a Chinese region within the range of *Dichaetomyia bibax* and *Aplomyia*, as well as the domestic distribution location for *Isomyia pseudolucilia*. The region is also home to the slender-billed near-vein flower fly (*瘦喙近脉花蝇*), black-valved *Moromyia* (*黑瓣莫蝇*), and *Pyrellia cyanicolor*. Additionally, Tibet hosts *Delia echinata* and the Sumatran narrow-faced tachinid fly (*1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇*), with the latter specifically documented in locations such as Baxiong Ranwu. The region is a key habitat for *Dasyphora* species and *Rypellia* species, which are found in areas like Linzhi, Bomi Yigong, Cayu, and Bomi. Tibet is further identified as a distribution zone for the rabbit *Austrozetetes* fly (*兔裸皮蝇*), the purple-nosed *Chrysomya* fly (*紫鼻狂蝇*), and the horned plate *Sepsis* fly (*角板鬃粪蝇*), the latter of which has its type locality at Aksang Tree (亚东阿桑树) in the region. The Tibetan Autonomous Region of China is also explicitly cited as the domestic range for the Tibetan warty *Sepsis* fly (*西藏疣麻蝇*), cataloged as number 1289. These findings highlight Tibet's ecological importance as a biodiversity hotspot for diverse fly species, spanning both native and potentially introduced taxa, with specific localities such as Linzhi, Bomi, and Aksang Tree underscoring its role in entomological studies. The region's unique environmental conditions likely contribute to the presence of these species, though further research may be needed to clarify interactions and ecological roles. All references consistently identify Tibet as part of China, emphasizing its status as an autonomous region within the country's administrative framework.
