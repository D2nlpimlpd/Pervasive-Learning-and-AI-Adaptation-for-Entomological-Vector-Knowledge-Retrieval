It is characterized by a small body size, with a length under 8 mm, and distinct morphological features, including 1–4 rows of upturned marginal setae on the cheeks. The species exhibits specific abdominal traits, as noted in both descriptions, and unique tarsal (leg segment) features, as highlighted in the second description. Additionally, it possesses notable tail plate characteristics, as described in the first account. These combined features—cheek setae, abdominal and tarsal morphology, and tail plate structure—distinguish *Delia sphaerobasis* from other members of the genus. The species is geographically distributed across northwestern China, occurring in the regions of Xinjiang, Qinghai (specifically the Qilian Niu Xing Mountain), and Inner Mongolia (Ejina Banner). Its habitat range suggests adaptation to arid or semi-arid environments typical of these areas. The taxonomic work by Fan and Qian in 1984 established the species’ classification, emphasizing its morphological uniqueness and regional distribution. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the authorship, year of description, and key diagnostic traits, with the second description adding tarsal features to the first’s focus on abdominal and tail plate characteristics. This synthesis captures the full scope of the data, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive overview of *Delia sphaerobasis*.\",10\n929,QINGHAI (QLIAN NIU XING MOUNTAIN),\"Region in Qinghai, China, where Delia sphaerobasis is distributed.\",1\n930,INNER MONGOLIA (EJINA BANNER),\"Region in Inner Mongolia, China, where Delia sphaerobasis is distributed.\",1\n934,WEN COUNTY,\"\n\nWen County is a geographical location situated in Gansu Province, China. It is notable for its association with two distinct species: *Pseudonupedia intersecta*, a plant species documented as occurring in the region, and *Delia sphaerobasis*, an insect species for which Wen County serves as the type locality. The term \"\"type locality\"\" indicates that Wen County is the specific geographic site where *Delia sphaerobasis* was first collected and described by taxonomists, establishing its reference point for scientific classification. Meanwhile, *Pseudonupedia intersecta* is recorded as being present in the area, though its ecological or botanical significance in the region is not elaborated in the provided data. Both descriptions highlight Wen County’s role in biodiversity documentation, particularly within the context of Gansu’s flora and fauna. The absence of conflicting information in the two descriptions allows for a unified summary, emphasizing the county’s dual relevance as a habitat for *Pseudonupedia intersecta* and the origin point for the taxonomic identification of *Delia sphaerobasis*. No further contradictions exist between the sources, and the combined details underscore Wen County’s importance in entomological and botanical studies.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1125,DELIA SPHAEROBASIS,QIAN,\"\n\n**DELIA SPHAEROBASIS** is a species first described by the author **Qian** in 1984.
