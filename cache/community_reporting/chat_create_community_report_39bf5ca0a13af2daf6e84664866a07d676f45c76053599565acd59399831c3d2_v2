The country also hosts *Sarcophaga haematodes*, *LUTEIVENTRIS DICHAETOMYIA*, and *Himalayan Spring Fly* (type locality), underscoring its role in the taxonomy and ecology of these insects. Additionally, *Neomyia fletcheri* (a greenbottle fly) and *Neomyia* species are documented in Nepal, alongside *Paradichosia scutellata*, which is collected in moist evergreen oak forests.  \n\nNepal’s fly fauna includes species such as *Anthomyia illocata*, *Sarcorohdendorfia mimobasalis*, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Eudasyphora cyanicolor*, *Hylemya nigrimana*, *Isomyia electa*, *Rhyncomya setipyga*, *Sturmiopsis inferens*, and *Tuye Pseudomyopina fumidorsis probola*. The genus *Lasiopelta* and *Linnaemya* are also reported to be distributed there. Specific localities within Nepal, such as the South end of Lake Baikal (likely a misstatement, as Lake Baikal is in Russia) and Bangel Kharka, are highlighted as first-discovery sites for *Phorbia perssoni* and *Phorbia tysoni*, respectively. *Polietes orientalis* adults have been collected on *Rhododendron* at 3,400 meters, indicating high-altitude adaptations.  \n\nThe country is linked to the distribution of *Adia danieli* (type locality) and the genus *Adia*, as well as *Scathophaga mellipes* and *Calythea setifrons* as international or foreign regions. *Metalliopsis setosa* and *Musca bezzii* are reported in Nepal, while *Musca crassirostris* is noted for its foreign distribution records. Chinese-named species like 戟斗细麻蝇 (a specific fly species) and 紫翠蝇, 绿翠蝇 (purple and green blowflies) are also found there, alongside 毛瓣家蝇 (a foreign distribution area for this species).  \n\nNepal’s role in entomological studies is further emphasized by its inclusion in taxonomic keys for Sarcophagini and as a distribution site for *Chlororhinia exempta* and *Insecta lapponica*. The genus *Sinonipponia* is documented in the region, and the species 1397卡西亚麻蝇 (likely a misrendered or localized name) is associated with Nepal. These records collectively illustrate Nepal’s ecological diversity and its importance as a habitat for both native and internationally distributed fly species, spanning lowland to high-altitude environments. The country’s moist evergreen oak forests and montane ecosystems contribute to the presence of specialized species like *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Polietes orientalis*.  \n\nBy synthesizing these data, Nepal emerges as a critical area for studying fly biodiversity, with contributions to the understanding of species such as *Lasiomma strigilatum* (Ackland, 1967) and the broader *Musca* genus. Its inclusion in foreign distribution contexts for certain species highlights its connectivity to global fly populations, while type localities and first-discovery sites underscore its role in taxonomic research.

Their work spanned multiple regions, including India, Europe, North America, and South America, with a focus on blowflies, parasitic species, and myiasis-related research.  \n\nIn the 1920s, Senior-White collaborated with **Patton** to describe the species *Musca seniorwhitei* in 1922 and *Musca fletcheri* in 1924. They also described the genus *Paradichosia* in 1923, including *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Burmanomyia beesoni* (1924), as well as *Sarcophaga futilis*, the type species of the *Iranihindia* genus. Notably, they documented *Sarcophaga kempi* (1924) and *Harpagophalla kempi* (1924), and contributed to the description of *Tainanina pilisquama* in 1925. Additionally, they described *松毛虫缅麻蝇* and *盘突缅麻蝇* in 1924, and *1394叉形亚麻蝇* in 1927, though the latter’s nomenclature may require further clarification due to non-Latin script.  \n\nBy the 1940s, Senior-White expanded their research to ecological and distributional studies. They authored a 1940 study on parasitism in *Nonagria sp.* and bovine myiasis, and documented the distribution of the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly (*Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina*) in South America. They also studied the distribution of *Rhinia apicalis* and *Stomorhina lunata* in 1940, as well as the species *1397卡西亚麻蝇* in the same year. Their work on *Pollenia* species larval hosts in Europe and North America, and the genus *Calliphora* in India (Khasi and Garo Hills), highlights their global scope. Senior-White co-authored *Isomyia pseudonepalana* (1940) in *Fauna Brit, India, Dipt.* and was cited for species distribution data across multiple countries, including India.  \n\nSenior-White’s taxonomic contributions include the 1923 description of *Caiusa testacea* (later reclassified under *Sarcophaga*), and their 1924 study on *Bengalia bezzii*. They also explored differences between dipteran species in 1940, underscoring their role in clarifying taxonomic boundaries. While one entry references a 1910 description of specimens in various regions, the majority of their documented work aligns with the 1920s and 1940s, suggesting this earlier reference may be an error or unrelated to their primary contributions.  \n\nTheir research was frequently associated with type localities in India and Australia, and they were cited in ecological studies of *Borbororhina pubescens* (1940) and *Lucilia cuprina*. Senior-White’s work remains foundational in understanding the taxonomy and biogeography of blowflies and parasitic flies, with species such as *Sarcophaga ostindicae* (1924) and *I. euidielloides* (1923) reflecting their detailed focus on regional faunas.  \n\nIn summary, Senior-White was a key figure in dipteran entomology, with a career marked by collaborative species descriptions, ecological investigations, and distributional analyses across diverse geographic and taxonomic contexts. Their legacy is preserved in multiple publications from 1922 to 1940, emphasizing their dedication to advancing the understanding of fly species and their roles in ecosystems and veterinary science.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",42\n726,SRI LANKA,\"\n\nSri Lanka, an island nation in South Asia, is a significant location for the distribution of numerous fly species, both as a native habitat and a foreign or introduced range.

Notably, Sri Lanka serves as a type locality for *Tainanina pilisquama* and *1394叉形亚麻蝇* (likely *Chrysomya pinguis* or a related species), while it is a foreign distribution site for *Musca crassirostris*, *Sarcophaga misera*, and *Sarcophaga sericea*. The country further records the presence of *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Neomyia* spp., and *Ophyra chalcogaster*. These findings highlight Sri Lanka’s ecological importance as both a native and secondary distribution hub for various fly taxa, contributing to global biodiversity and taxonomic studies. The repeated references to \"\"the species\"\" in vague terms suggest broader, less specific records, but the detailed mentions of individual species and genera confirm its role in supporting a rich and varied fly fauna.\",37\n4815,IRANIHINDIA,\"\n\n**IRANIHINDIA** is a genus of blow flies belonging to the Sarcophagidae family, predominantly found in the Oriental region. The genus is distinguished by several morphological traits, particularly in male specimens. Males of *IRANIHINDIA* exhibit a narrow frons (the area between the eyes and antennae) and long antennae, which are key identifiers for the group. Additionally, the genus is characterized by specific abdominal bristle patterns, including the presence of developed abdominal median bristles and spiny bristles at the tip of the abdomen. Another notable feature is the male anal leaf, which displays a central concavity, a structural detail that further differentiates *IRANIHINDIA* from related genera. These combined traits—narrow frons, elongated antennae, specialized abdominal bristles, and the concave anal leaf—serve as diagnostic markers for taxonomic classification within the Sarcophagidae family. The descriptions provided align in emphasizing abdominal bristle morphology and male-specific structures, with no direct contradictions. The genus is primarily associated with the Oriental biogeographic region, reflecting its ecological and geographic context.\",8\n1944,POLIETES ORIENTALIS,\"\n\nPOLIETES ORIENTALIS is a species of fly within the genus *Polietes*, first described by Pont in 1972. It is characterized by distinct morphological traits, including specific bristle lengths and a body size ranging from 9 to 12 millimeters. The species is geographically distributed across several regions in Asia, with confirmed records in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces of China, as well as in Nepal and India. While the first description notes its presence in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Nepal, the second expands the range to include India, suggesting a broader distribution within the Himalayan and southern Chinese regions. As a member of the *Polietes* genus, it likely shares ecological or taxonomic traits with related species, though its unique physical attributes and geographic range distinguish it. The inclusion of both scientific and common terminology (e.g., \"\"species of Polietes\"\" and \"\"species of fly\"\") in the descriptions indicates that *Polietes orientalis* is a taxonomic entity within the fly order Diptera. No contradictions in the data are present, as the additional mention of India in the second description complements the first without conflict. The summary consolidates all provided details into a cohesive account of the species' classification, morphology, and distribution.\",6\n4927,BURMANOMYIA BEESONI,\"A species of fly described by Senior-White in 1924, associated with pine caterpillars, found in China and Southeast Asia\",3\n5222,WALAYARI,\"A closely related species to anchoriformis, described by Senior-White in 1924, found in India's Madras Province forests\",3\n2068,IRAN,\"\n\nIran, a Middle Eastern country, is recognized as a significant region for the distribution of various fly species across multiple genera and families. It is documented as a country where *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *Sarcophaga haematodes* are present, contributing to the global range of the Sarcophagini tribe, which is referenced in taxonomic keys. Additionally, Iran hosts *Dasyphora asiatica*, a species associated with its ecological diversity. The Haematobia genus, including *Haematobia titillans*, *H. minuta*, and *H. irritans*, is also reported to be distributed there, highlighting its role in parasitic fly habitats. \n\nIran’s biodiversity further includes *Lispe leucospila*, *Musca larvipara*, and *Musca sorbens* (also known as 马粪碧蝇 in Chinese), with the latter being noted as an international distribution site. The country has foreign distribution records for *Musca crassirostris*, indicating its presence in non-native regions. The Helicophagella genus and *Bayan Wohlfahrtia* (a species of Wohlfahrtia fly) are also associated with Iran as part of their global ranges. \n\nNotably, *Metopodia grisea* and *Chrysomya pinguis* are explicitly mentioned as species found in Iran, underscoring its importance in the study of blowflies and flesh flies. The country is further referenced as a foreign location where multiple species of the Stomorhina genus occur, though specific species names are not provided. A Chinese text also notes the presence of species like \"\"1254钝叶污蝇\"\" (likely a catalog or regional identifier) in Iran, though the exact taxonomic classification of this species remains unclear. \n\nIn summary, Iran serves as a critical distribution hub for a wide array of fly species, including parasitic, myiasis-causing, and common blowflies. Its inclusion in taxonomic keys and foreign distribution records emphasizes its ecological and zoogeographical relevance. The presence of both native and non-native species, such as *Musca crassirostris*, reflects the country’s role in broader biogeographical patterns. These findings collectively position Iran as a focal point for entomological research, particularly in understanding the spread and taxonomy of flies in the region.\",9\n3706,变丽蝇属,\"变丽蝇属 (Paradichosia) is a genus of flies characterized by black or entirely black eyes with dense powder coating, variable coloration, yellow legs, and specific morphological features in male and female reproductive structures.

Additionally, *Chlororhinia exempta* is documented as being present in Assam, highlighting the state's role as a habitat for this species. Beyond these specific examples, Assam is also associated with a broader genus (though the genus name is unspecified in the provided data), underscoring its importance in the study of regional entomology or taxonomy. As a state, Assam is characterized by its diverse ecosystems, ranging from tropical rainforests to wetlands, which contribute to its status as a biodiversity hotspot. The descriptions collectively emphasize Assam's ecological and scientific relevance, particularly in the context of species discovery and conservation.\",4\n3897,PARADICHOSIA SCUTELLATA,\"Insect species described by Senior-White in 1923, later studied by Kano, Shinonaga, and Kurahashi\",18\n1312,DARJEELING,\"\n\n**DARJEELING** is a region located in the Indian state of West Bengal, renowned for its geographical and ecological significance. It is primarily recognized as a type locality for two distinct species: *Calythea setifrons* and *Paradichosia scutellata*. The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the specific geographic location where a species is first discovered and described, serving as a reference point for its taxonomic classification. For *Calythea setifrons*, Darjeeling is noted both as a distribution site and its type locality, indicating that the species is native to or commonly found in this area. Similarly, *Paradichosia scutellata* is explicitly identified as having its type locality in Darjeeling, further emphasizing the region's role in biodiversity documentation. \n\nThe descriptions provided consistently highlight Darjeeling's association with these species, though they vary slightly in phrasing. One entry specifies it as the \"\"mode locality\"\" for *Paradichosia scutellata*, which may be a typographical or terminological variation of \"\"type locality.\"\" To resolve this, the summary adopts the standard taxonomic term \"\"type locality\"\" for both species, as it is the most precise and widely recognized designation. \n\nDarjeeling’s ecological importance is underscored by its status as a habitat for these species, which are likely part of the region’s unique flora or fauna. The area is also famous for its tea plantations, particularly Darjeeling tea, and its mountainous terrain, which contributes to diverse microhabitats. However, the primary focus of the data is its role in biological taxonomy, linking it to the scientific study and classification of these two species. \n\nIn summary, **DARJEELING** is a key geographical and ecological site in India, serving as the type locality for *Calythea setifrons* and *Paradichosia scutellata*. It is both a location where *Calythea setifrons* is distributed and the origin point for the taxonomic description of both species. This dual role highlights Darjeeling’s significance in scientific research and conservation efforts, particularly for species endemic to or representative of the region’s biodiversity. The data aligns across all descriptions, confirming Darjeeling’s position as a critical reference in the study of these organisms. \n\n(Word count: 200)\",4\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n853,INDIA,ECONOMIC INSECTS OF CHINA,The Economic Insects of China publication documents fly species found in India,131\n7523,SPOLETTA ZEYLANICA,INDIA,The Spol.
