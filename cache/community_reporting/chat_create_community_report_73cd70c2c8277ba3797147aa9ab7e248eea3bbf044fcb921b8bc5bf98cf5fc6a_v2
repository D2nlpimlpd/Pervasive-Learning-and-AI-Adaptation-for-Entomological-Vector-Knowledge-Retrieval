Their work spanned multiple genera, including *Meliniella*, *Leucophora*, *Pegomyza*, *Phaonia*, *Phorbia*, *Chirosia*, and *Delia*, with descriptions published in scientific journals such as *Ann. Ent. Fenn.* (Annales Entomologici Fennici).  \n\nTIENSUU first described *Meliniella bisinuata* in 1939, a species within the genus *Meliniella*. The same year, they also documented *Leucophora tavastica*, contributing to the taxonomy of the *Leucophora* genus. In 1938, TIENSUU authored the species *Pegomyza consanguinea* and *角缘花蝇* (likely the Chinese name for *Pegomyza consanguinea*), both published in *Ann. Ent. Fenn.*, indicating their focus on *Pegomyza* species during this period. Their 1935 work included the description of *Phorbia securis*, while *Chirosia similata* was added to the scientific record in 1939.  \n\nIn 1946, TIENSUU expanded their research by describing *Phaonia fugax* and *Delia cuneata* (also cited as *Delia cuneata* Tiensuu, 1946). Additionally, they were associated with the description of *Delia conversata*, though the exact year is unspecified in the data. TIENSUU’s expertise in *Delia* species is further highlighted by their 1946 work on *Delia cuneata*.  \n\nBeyond species descriptions, TIENSUU was cited in ecological studies related to *Pegohylemyia* species in Finland, suggesting their involvement in broader entomological research, including ecological contexts. Their publications and taxonomic work reflect a focus on the biodiversity and systematics of flies, particularly in the Nordic region.  \n\nTIENSUU’s legacy includes foundational contributions to the understanding of dipteran taxonomy, with species descriptions spanning over a decade and multiple genera. Their work in *Ann. Ent. Fenn.* and other journals remains a critical reference for entomologists studying these taxa. The consistency in their authorship across different species and years underscores their dedication to the field, while their ecological insights into *Pegohylemyia* demonstrate a multidisciplinary approach to entomology.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",9\n1035,SAKHALIN ISLAND,,2\n951,DELIA CUNETA,\"Delia cuneata is a species of fly described by Tiensuu in 1946, with type locality in Sweden and distribution in China\",3\n965,\"ANN.
