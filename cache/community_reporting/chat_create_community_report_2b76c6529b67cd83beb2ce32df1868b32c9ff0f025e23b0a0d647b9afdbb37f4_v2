It is home to multiple species within the genus *Helina*, including *Helina ciliata*, *H. bohemani* (Jingyuan), *H. nudifemorata latiscissa*, *H. hirtifemorata*, *H. hirsutitibia*, *H. brunneipalpis*, and *H. trivittata* (specifically at Longde). The region also hosts *Tachina albidopilosa* and *T. noctuarum*, the latter of which parasitizes the Poplar Defoliator. *Parasarcophaga* species such as *P. aegyptica*, *P. jacobsoni*, *P. albiceps*, and *P. macroauriculata* are documented in Ningxia, alongside *Sarcophaga semenovi* and *S. aegyptica*. The genus *Adia* is present, as are *Musca autumnalis*, *M. conducens*, *M. tempestiva*, and *M. tempestiva* (秋家蝇, a Chinese name for a *Musca* species). *Delia latissima*, *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Helicophagella maculata*, *Hydrotaea mimopilipes*, *H. palaestrica* (noted at Longde), and *I. tripartita* are also part of Ningxia’s entomological records. The region is notable for *Xylotachina diluta*, which parasitizes an unnamed wood borer species, and *Phormia regina* in Yinchuan. Specific locations within Ningxia, such as Helan Mountains, Tongxin, Luoshan, and Liupan Mountain (where *Helina intermedia* is found), are frequently cited in species studies. The Chinese names 紫翠蝇 and 绿翠蝇, likely referring to *Helina* or related species, are documented in the region. Ningxia’s biodiversity is further highlighted by the presence of *Haematobia* and the documented distribution of *Periscepsia carbonaria*. These findings underscore Ningxia’s ecological importance as a habitat for a wide array of fly species, many of which play roles in parasitism, decomposition, or as indicators of environmental health. The region’s varied landscapes, including mountainous and arid areas, contribute to its status as a key location for entomological research in China.
