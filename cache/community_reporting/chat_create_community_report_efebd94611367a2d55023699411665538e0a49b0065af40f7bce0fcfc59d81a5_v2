Among the notable genera found in Beijing are **Adia**, **Bactromyia**, **Bercaea**, **Blondelia**, **Calythea**, **Carcelia** (with *Carcelia matsukarehae*, *Carcelia ambigua*, and *Carcelia lymantriae*), **Cuphocera**, **Delia**, **Eumetopiella**, **Exorista**, **Gonia** (including *Gonia chinensis*, *Gonia bimaculata*, and *Gonia picea*), **Heteronychia**, **Hydrotaea**, **Lasiomma**, **Lispe** (*Lispe monochaita* and *Lispe melaleuca*), **Muscina**, **Musca** (*Musca autumnalis*, *Musca bezzii*, *Musca conducens*, and *Musca tempestiva*), **Nemoraea**, **Paradichosia**, **Parasarcophaga** (*Parasarcophaga polystylata* and *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata*), **Pegomya**, **Polleniopsis**, **Prosena**, **Robineauella**, **Siphona**, **Tachina** (*Tachina noctuarum* and *Tachina nupta*), and **Winthemia**. Specific species documented in Beijing include *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Compsilura concinnata*, *Heteronychia quoi*, *Macronychia polyodon*, *Bellardia benshiensis*, *Bellardia menechma*, *Blondelia nigripes*, *Craspedoeta* spp., *Eumetopiella (lntermedia) luridimacula* (found in Baohua Mountain), *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (in Wofosi and Yanqing), *Graphomya rufitibia*, *Hyleorus elatus*, *Paradichosia scutellata*, *Phormia regina*, *Phylloteles stackelbergi*, *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Prosena* spp., and *Zaira* spp. Additionally, Beijing is the type locality for the genus *Hoa* and the species *Calliphora sinensis*, as well as a domestic distribution site for *Calliphora vicina* (Red-headed Calliphora) and *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*. The region also hosts *Meigenia grandigena*, *Meigenia majuscula*, and *Medina collaris*, alongside the *1431家蚕追寄蝇* (domestic silkworm tachinid fly) and *614裸蹠芒蝇* (naked tarsal芒蝇). Beijing is further linked to the distribution of *1256黑须污蝇* (black-haired dirty fly), *圆斑莠蝇* (circular-spotted fly), and *THICK RING BLACK FLY*. The municipality supports the larvae of *Protocalliphora azurea* in sparrow nests and is home to the *Brush Spring Fly*. Notably, Beijing overlaps with Hebei province in some references, but as a municipality, it is distinct. The data collectively highlight Beijing’s ecological role as a shared distribution location for multiple fly species, including both common and regionally specific taxa, with records spanning genera, species, and localized observations. This underscores its importance in entomological studies within China.

It has a single posteroventral tibial seta, triangular black markings on the thorax, and is distributed in China (Beijing, Guangxi, Fuzhou) and globally in Europe and Africa.\",6\n2074,ZHANGBEI,\"Zhangbei is a city in Hebei province, China\",1\n2076,SHANHAIGUAN,\"Shanhaiguan is a city in Hebei province, China\",1\n4892,WANG SHUYONG,\"\n\nWang Shuyong is an individual associated with entomological research and collection activities in Beijing, China. Notably, he is recognized as a collector who documented the species *Heteronychia quoi*, contributing to the understanding of its distribution or characteristics in the region. Additionally, Wang Shuyong is linked to the study of *Meigenia grandigena*, another entomological subject, further highlighting his involvement in documenting or analyzing insect biodiversity in Beijing. While the descriptions do not specify the exact nature of his role in the study of *Meigenia grandigena* (e.g., whether he conducted fieldwork, taxonomic analysis, or collaborative research), they collectively establish his engagement with entomological work in the area. The lack of direct contradiction between the two descriptions allows for a unified summary, emphasizing his contributions to the documentation of at least two distinct species within the same geographic context. His activities likely support broader scientific efforts to catalog and understand insect populations in Beijing, though further details about his methodologies, affiliations, or the scope of his research remain unspecified in the provided data.\",3\n5536,ZHOU SHIXIU,Zhou Shixiu is an individual associated with the study of Meigenia grandigena in Beijing.,2\n4099,STEJN,Stejn is a researcher associated with the subspecies Passer montanus saturatue in Beijing,1\n1505,PEGOMYA ORIENTIS,\"Fly species described by Suwa in 1974, found in Shanghai and Zhejiang\",4\n5485,1431家蚕追寄蝇,,18\n5507,TACHINA NOCTUARUM,A species of fly described by Rondani in 1865,11\n1066,LEUCOPHORA UNILINEATA,\"Leucophora unilineata is a species of fly described by Zetterstedt in 1920, characterized by specific morphological features such as wing bristles and body length of 6-7 mm\",7\n1464,PEGOMYA CUNICULARIA,\"A species of Pegomya fly in the Pegomya hyoscyami group with no pre-dorsal bristles on the fore tibia, yellow or brownish lower mouthparts, and dark-tipped antennae.

It serves as a domestic distribution location for numerous insect species, including both flies and parasitic wasps. Among the notable species recorded in Guangxi are *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca convexifrons* (found in Guilin and Yushan), and *Musca crassirostris* (with records in Guilin Yanshan and Yangshuo). The region is also home to *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Argyrophylax phoeda*, *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*, and *Carcelia matsukarehae*, *Carcelia ambigua*, *Carcelia lymantriae*, as well as *Carcelia kockiana*. \n\nGuangxi hosts several species of the genus *Parasarcophaga*, including *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Parasarcophaga idmais*, *Parasarcophaga hui*, and *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*. Additionally, the region is a habitat for *Servillia planiforceps*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Heteronychia quoi*, *Bengalia* species, *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, *Dichaetomyia* species, *Lispe loewi*, *Stomorhina obsoleta*, *Austrophorocera*, *Caiusa coomani*, *Nemoraea pellucida*, *Cuphocera varia*, *Miltogramma iberium*, *Dolichocolon klapperichi*, and *Anthomyia illocata*. Specific localities within Guangxi, such as Nanning and Wuzhou, are highlighted for the presence of *Chrysomya pinguis*, *Chrysomya megacephala*, and *Chrysomya bezziana*. \n\nThe region is further associated with the distribution of *Stomoxys sitiens*, *Medina collaris*, *Gonia chinensis*, *Neomyia* species, *Vibrissina Rondani* genus, *Bessa* genus, *Achoetandrus rufifacies* (at Guilin Yanshan), *Hemipyrellia liguriens* (in Yangshuo), and *Actia nigroscutellata*. Chinese names for species include 紫翠蝇 (a species of fly), 翼阳细麻蝇, 1430筒须新怯寄蝇, and 1393义乌亚麻蝇, 1399胡氏亚麻蝇, alongside the genus *Hengda Jiewei Jiying* (recorded in Longsheng) and *Sisyropa prominens* (also found with *Drino inconspicua*). \n\nGuangxi’s biodiversity is underscored by its inclusion of *Lydella grisescens*, *I. euidielloides*, and *Lydella* species, as well as the genus *Lydella* and *Miltogramma iberium*. The region’s cities, such as Baise, Chongzuo, and Lingye, are noted for their ecological significance in supporting these species. While some descriptions refer to Guangxi as a \"\"province,\"\" it is technically an autonomous region within China, a distinction that aligns with its administrative classification. The data collectively emphasize Guangxi as a critical area for the study and conservation of various fly and parasitic wasp species, with specific localities and genera contributing to its entomological importance.
