Active primarily in the early 1800s, he described numerous species across multiple genera, many of which were later reclassified or synonymized. His work is associated with Swedish scientific publications, including the *Monographia Muscidum Sueciae* and the *Insecta Lapp.* journal, reflecting his focus on European, especially Scandinavian, insect fauna.  \n\nFallen’s earliest documented contributions date to **1810**, when he described *Phryxe vulgaris*, *Voria ruralis* (now *锥赛蜂麻蝇* in Chinese), *Zaira cinerea* (type species of the genus *Eustalomyia*), *Meigenia mutabilis*, and *Blondelia nigripes*. By **1816**, he had added *Protocalliphora azurea* and *Morellia hortorum* to his list of described species. In **1817**, Fallen’s work expanded to include *Musca haemorrhoidalis* (now *Linnaemya haemorrhoidalis*), *Musca affinis* (later *Angiometopa affinis*), and *Musca lineata* (now *Linnaemya lineata*).  \n\nThe **1820s** marked his most prolific period. In **1820**, he described *Spallanzania hebes*, *Exorista fasciata*, *Tachina devia* (later synonymized with *Brachicoma devia*), and *Macquartia dispar*. By **1823**, he had documented *Hydrophoria ambigua*, *Musca grisea* (now *Coenosia grisea*), and *Limnophora triangula*. In **1824**, Fallen’s work included *Paraprosalpia silvestris* and *Subhylemyia longula* (now *Subhylemyia longula*). His **1825** publications were particularly significant, featuring descriptions of *Lispe pygmaea*, *Lispe litorea*, *Delia coarctata*, *Delia floralis*, *Phaonia fuscata*, *Adia cinerella*, *Helina confinis*, *Muscina stabulans* (type species of *Muscina*), and *胸刺厕蝇* (a Chinese name for an unspecified species). Notably, he synonymized *Drymeia obscura* with *Musca hamata* in 1823, demonstrating his role in refining taxonomic classifications.  \n\nFallen’s legacy includes foundational work in the taxonomy of genera such as *Coenosia*, *Eustalomyia*, and *Muscina*. His descriptions of species like *Schoenomyza litorella* (1823) and *Pegohylemyia striolata* (1817) remain critical to entomological studies. Despite some species being reclassified over time, his original names and classifications are frequently cited in modern literature. Fallen’s meticulous documentation and association with key 19th-century entomological journals underscore his importance in advancing the understanding of fly biodiversity during his era.  \n\nThe summary consolidates all provided data, resolving minor inconsistencies (e.g., *Schoenomyza litorella* is consistently attributed to 1823, while *Musca haemorrhoidalis* is noted as the original 1817 name).

It is characterized by a narrow black dorsal abdominal stripe, a feature that distinguishes it within its genus. The fly also possesses a feathered arista, a bristle-like structure on the head that is often used in taxonomic identification. Its body length is approximately 6.5 mm, placing it within the typical size range for members of the Hydrophoria genus.  \n\nThe species has a broad geographic distribution, occurring in multiple continents. It is found in **Heilongjiang** (a region in northeastern China), as well as in **Asia**, **Europe**, and **North America**. In Europe, it is specifically documented in **Scania**, a region in southern Sweden, which aligns with the first description’s mention of \"\"Sweden Scania.\"\" This clarification resolves any ambiguity in the second description, which only notes \"\"Scania\"\" without specifying the country. The presence of *Hydrophoria ambigua* in these regions suggests a wide ecological adaptability, though specific habitat preferences or ecological roles are not detailed in the provided data.  \n\nThe two descriptions provided are largely consistent, with the primary difference being the explicit mention of Sweden in the first. By consolidating the information, the summary confirms the species’ taxonomic origin, physical traits, and global distribution.
