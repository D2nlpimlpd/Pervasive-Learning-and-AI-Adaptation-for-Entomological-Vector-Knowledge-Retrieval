Notably, they documented *Sarcophaga kempi* (1924) and *Harpagophalla kempi* (1924), and contributed to the description of *Tainanina pilisquama* in 1925. Additionally, they described *松毛虫缅麻蝇* and *盘突缅麻蝇* in 1924, and *1394叉形亚麻蝇* in 1927, though the latter’s nomenclature may require further clarification due to non-Latin script.  \n\nBy the 1940s, Senior-White expanded their research to ecological and distributional studies. They authored a 1940 study on parasitism in *Nonagria sp.* and bovine myiasis, and documented the distribution of the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly (*Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina*) in South America. They also studied the distribution of *Rhinia apicalis* and *Stomorhina lunata* in 1940, as well as the species *1397卡西亚麻蝇* in the same year. Their work on *Pollenia* species larval hosts in Europe and North America, and the genus *Calliphora* in India (Khasi and Garo Hills), highlights their global scope. Senior-White co-authored *Isomyia pseudonepalana* (1940) in *Fauna Brit, India, Dipt.* and was cited for species distribution data across multiple countries, including India.  \n\nSenior-White’s taxonomic contributions include the 1923 description of *Caiusa testacea* (later reclassified under *Sarcophaga*), and their 1924 study on *Bengalia bezzii*. They also explored differences between dipteran species in 1940, underscoring their role in clarifying taxonomic boundaries. While one entry references a 1910 description of specimens in various regions, the majority of their documented work aligns with the 1920s and 1940s, suggesting this earlier reference may be an error or unrelated to their primary contributions.  \n\nTheir research was frequently associated with type localities in India and Australia, and they were cited in ecological studies of *Borbororhina pubescens* (1940) and *Lucilia cuprina*. Senior-White’s work remains foundational in understanding the taxonomy and biogeography of blowflies and parasitic flies, with species such as *Sarcophaga ostindicae* (1924) and *I. euidielloides* (1923) reflecting their detailed focus on regional faunas.  \n\nIn summary, Senior-White was a key figure in dipteran entomology, with a career marked by collaborative species descriptions, ecological investigations, and distributional analyses across diverse geographic and taxonomic contexts. Their legacy is preserved in multiple publications from 1922 to 1940, emphasizing their dedication to advancing the understanding of fly species and their roles in ecosystems and veterinary science.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",42\n726,SRI LANKA,\"\n\nSri Lanka, an island nation in South Asia, is a significant location for the distribution of numerous fly species, both as a native habitat and a foreign or introduced range. The country hosts a diverse array of flies, including *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, and *Musca seniorwhitei*, as well as *Dichaetomyia luteiventer*, *Dichaetomyia apicalis*, and *Dichaetomyia quadrata*. It is also the type locality for *Dichaetomyia keiseri* and *Ceylonomyia nigripes*, underscoring its role in the taxonomic classification of these species. Additionally, Sri Lanka is home to *Caiusa testacea*, with *Bengalia labiata* as its type species, and supports populations of *Bengalia* spp., *Borbororhina bivittata*, *Borbororhinia bivittata*, *Haematobia minuta*, *Halydaia* and *Linnaemyia* spp., *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, *Leucomyia cinerea*, *Myospila argentata*, *Lasiopelta* spp., *Pegomya quadrivittata*, and the Indian greenbottle fly. Specific species such as *Anthomyia illocata*, *Anthomyia plumiseta*, *Atherigona exigua*, and *Atherigona triglomerata* are documented within its borders, alongside the Chinese-named species *紫翠蝇* (likely *Chrysomya bezziana* or a related *Chrysomya* species) and *612黄髭芒蝇* (possibly *Chrysomya pinguis* or another *Chrysomya* species). The genus *Stomorhina* is also reported to have multiple species distributed in Sri Lanka as a foreign location. Notably, Sri Lanka serves as a type locality for *Tainanina pilisquama* and *1394叉形亚麻蝇* (likely *Chrysomya pinguis* or a related species), while it is a foreign distribution site for *Musca crassirostris*, *Sarcophaga misera*, and *Sarcophaga sericea*. The country further records the presence of *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Neomyia* spp., and *Ophyra chalcogaster*. These findings highlight Sri Lanka’s ecological importance as both a native and secondary distribution hub for various fly taxa, contributing to global biodiversity and taxonomic studies. The repeated references to \"\"the species\"\" in vague terms suggest broader, less specific records, but the detailed mentions of individual species and genera confirm its role in supporting a rich and varied fly fauna.\",37\n4815,IRANIHINDIA,\"\n\n**IRANIHINDIA** is a genus of blow flies belonging to the Sarcophagidae family, predominantly found in the Oriental region. The genus is distinguished by several morphological traits, particularly in male specimens. Males of *IRANIHINDIA* exhibit a narrow frons (the area between the eyes and antennae) and long antennae, which are key identifiers for the group. Additionally, the genus is characterized by specific abdominal bristle patterns, including the presence of developed abdominal median bristles and spiny bristles at the tip of the abdomen. Another notable feature is the male anal leaf, which displays a central concavity, a structural detail that further differentiates *IRANIHINDIA* from related genera. These combined traits—narrow frons, elongated antennae, specialized abdominal bristles, and the concave anal leaf—serve as diagnostic markers for taxonomic classification within the Sarcophagidae family. The descriptions provided align in emphasizing abdominal bristle morphology and male-specific structures, with no direct contradictions. The genus is primarily associated with the Oriental biogeographic region, reflecting its ecological and geographic context.\",8\n1944,POLIETES ORIENTALIS,\"\n\nPOLIETES ORIENTALIS is a species of fly within the genus *Polietes*, first described by Pont in 1972. It is characterized by distinct morphological traits, including specific bristle lengths and a body size ranging from 9 to 12 millimeters. The species is geographically distributed across several regions in Asia, with confirmed records in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces of China, as well as in Nepal and India. While the first description notes its presence in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Nepal, the second expands the range to include India, suggesting a broader distribution within the Himalayan and southern Chinese regions. As a member of the *Polietes* genus, it likely shares ecological or taxonomic traits with related species, though its unique physical attributes and geographic range distinguish it. The inclusion of both scientific and common terminology (e.g., \"\"species of Polietes\"\" and \"\"species of fly\"\") in the descriptions indicates that *Polietes orientalis* is a taxonomic entity within the fly order Diptera. No contradictions in the data are present, as the additional mention of India in the second description complements the first without conflict.
