The USA is noted as the possible type locality for the fly species *Coenosia incisurata* in the state of Wisconsin, indicating its role in the taxonomic documentation of this organism. Additionally, the country is a native distribution range for *Phaonia mimobasiseta* and *Lixophaga parva*, the latter being utilized for large-scale biological control of sugarcane borers, a critical application in agricultural pest management. The USA also hosts *Phaonia hybrida*, though it is described as a \"\"foreign region\"\" for this species, suggesting its presence there may be non-native or introduced. Furthermore, the USA is identified as the type locality for *Mydaea bideserta* in North America, underscoring its importance in the geographical classification of this species. \n\nBeyond its ecological role, the USA is the home country of Prof. B. Greenberg and other collaborators, who are likely involved in entomological or related scientific research given the context of the species mentioned. This academic connection implies the USA contributes to studies on these organisms, potentially linking their biological roles to practical applications such as pest control. The descriptions collectively emphasize the USA’s biodiversity, its utility in applied entomology (e.g., *Lixophaga parva* for sugarcane borer management), and its position as a hub for scientific collaboration. While some species (*Phaonia mimobasiseta*, *Lixophaga parva*) are naturally distributed in the USA, others (*Phaonia hybrida*) are present in what is termed a \"\"foreign region,\"\" resolving potential contradictions by distinguishing between native and non-native occurrences. The country’s involvement in both the natural habitats of certain species and the introduction of others reflects its dynamic role in ecological systems and human-driven biological interventions. The mention of Wisconsin as a specific location for *Coenosia incisurata* and the broader North American context for *Mydaea bideserta* further illustrate the USA’s regional diversity in supporting these species. Overall, the USA is portrayed as a multifaceted entity in entomological research, agricultural practices, and taxonomic studies, with contributions from its native ecosystems and scientific community.\",8\n66,PROF.
