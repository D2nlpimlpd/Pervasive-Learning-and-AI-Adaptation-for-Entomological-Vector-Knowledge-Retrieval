It is characterized by a yellowish dorsal plate (likely the thoracic scutellum), a yellow powder covering its body, and a narrow marginal band accompanied by a central stripe on the abdomen. The seventh and eighth abdominal segments are fused and exhibit a brown coloration, a key morphological trait. The male genitalia, specifically the aedeagus, are distinctly arched or arc-shaped, aligning with the species' diagnostic features. With a body length of approximately 5 mm, *P. flavoscotellata* is a small but notable member of its genus. \n\nGeographically, the species is distributed across Qinghai in China, Europe (with the type locality recorded as St. Moritz), and North America. The inclusion of North America in its range is derived from the first description, while the second confirms its presence in Qinghai and Europe. These regions suggest a broad, transcontinental distribution, though specific ecological preferences or habitat details are not provided in the given data. \n\nThe descriptions provided are largely consistent, with minor discrepancies in terminology resolved by prioritizing precise anatomical references (e.g., \"\"abdominal scutellum\"\" in the second description is likely a misstatement, as the scutellum is a thoracic structure, and the \"\"yellowish dorsal plate\"\" from the first is retained). The species is thus defined by its distinctive yellow abdominal markings, fused brown segments, and arched aedeagus, alongside its historical classification and wide geographic spread.\",4\n1462,ST.
