(Zetterstedt) in 1845, closely related to Leucophora hangzhouensis\",2\n519,ZETT.,\"\n\nZETT., an entomologist historically associated with the description of multiple insect species, is recognized for their contributions to the taxonomy of beetles and moths. The entity is linked to the species *Phengodes morio*, *Phengodes pallidisquama*, and *Phengodes consobrina*, which belong to the genus *Phengodes* (likely a longhorn beetle genus, *Phengodes*). Additionally, ZETT. described *Aricia albitarsis* in 1845, a species within the genus *Aricia*, and *Leucophora unistriata*, part of the genus *Leucophora*. The entity is also credited with describing *Phengodes grandaeva* and *Phengodes aeneiventris*, further expanding their work on *Phengodes* species. These contributions span various taxonomic groups, indicating ZETT.’s expertise in entomology, particularly in classifying beetles and moths. The use of the abbreviation \"\"Zett.\"\" in scientific literature typically refers to the Swedish entomologist **Erik Zetterstedt** (1812–1875), a prominent 19th-century naturalist known for his extensive work on Coleoptera (beetles) and Lepidoptera (moths). Zetterstedt’s descriptions of these species, including *Phengodes* and *Leucophora*, reflect his role in documenting biodiversity during the period of classical taxonomy. His work on *Aricia albitarsis* in 1845 aligns with his broader efforts to classify and name insect species, many of which remain foundational in modern entomological studies. The species attributed to ZETT. demonstrate a focus on both morphological and ecological diversity, as evidenced by the distinct genera and species he described. While some descriptions reference specific years (e.g., *Aricia albitarsis* in 1845), others lack precise dates, suggesting that Zetterstedt’s contributions may span multiple decades of his career. The inclusion of species like *Phengodes aeneiventris* and *Phengodes grandaeva* underscores his specialization in the *Phengodes* genus, which is part of the family Phengodidae (lightning beetles). Overall, ZETT. (Erik Zetterstedt) is a key figure in 19th-century entomology, with a legacy of describing and categorizing numerous insect species that continue to be studied today. His work remains a critical reference for understanding the taxonomy and distribution of these organisms.
