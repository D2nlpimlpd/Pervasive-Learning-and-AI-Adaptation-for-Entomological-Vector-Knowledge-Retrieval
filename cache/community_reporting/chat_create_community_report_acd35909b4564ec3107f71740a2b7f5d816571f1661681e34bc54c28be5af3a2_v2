His work spanned multiple genera and species, with notable achievements including the establishment of the genera *Borbororhina* and *Metalliopsis* in 1917, as well as the description of *Acuphocera sumatrensis* in 1926 and *Tachina utilis* and *Austrophorocera* in earlier works. Townsend also described the genus *Sarcotachinella* in 1892, which is associated with parasitic flies, and established the tribe *Protodexiini* in 1912 and *Tephromyiini* in 1919, both significant in tachinid systematics.  \n\nIn 1911, he described the genera *Bactromyia* and *Myxexoristops*, the latter of which was later cited in *Acta Zoologica Sinica*. He also established *Eudasyphora* in the same year and contributed to the classification of related genera such as *Chlororhina*, *Stomorhina*, and *Borbororhinia*. Townsend’s work in 1916 included the description of *Protomiltogramma*, *Sturmiopsis inferens*, *Neophryxe psychidis*, and the type species *Metalliopsis setosa*, alongside the establishment of the subgenus *Hypodermodes*. The following year, he described *Murdockiana* and *Polleniopsis*, including its type species *Polleniopsis pilosa*, and established the subgenus *Bufolucilia* in 1919.  \n\nTownsend’s mid-1920s to 1930s research expanded to include *Goniophyto formosensis* (1927), *Carcelia kockiana* (1927, published in \"\"Supplta.ent., 16: 65\"\"), and *Cypselodoptera* (1934) in *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.*. He described *Metopia sauteri* in 1932 and *Thecocarcelia* in 1933, while also establishing the subgenus *Scutellorthellia* in 1933 and the genus *Hemipyrellia* in 1918, including its type species. His 1931 work introduced the genus *Pollenomyia*, and he later described the subgenus *Viviparomusca* (胎家蝇亚属) in 1933, alongside *Synorbitomyia* in 1932.  \n\nAdditional contributions include the synonymization of *Arachnidomyia* with *Pierretia*, the establishment of *Hypopygiopsis* in 1916, and the description of *Lixophaga parva* in 1908, which marked his early focus on parasitic flies with distinct bristle and body features. Townsend also described *Exorista japonica* in 1909 and the genus *Chloroidia*. His work on *Chlororhinia viridis* (1917) and *Isomyia nebulosa* (1917) further highlights his expertise in morphological taxonomy.  \n\nThroughout his career, Townsend’s publications and classifications provided foundational insights into dipteran taxonomy, emphasizing meticulous attention to anatomical details and phylogenetic relationships. His legacy includes the establishment of tribes, genera, subgenera, and species that remain critical to modern entomological studies.\",56\n3566,BUFOLUCILIA,\"\n\n**BUFOLUCILIA** is a subgenus of the genus *Lucilia*, first described by Townsend in 1919. It is distinguished by the presence of three postmedian bristles, a key morphological feature that aids in its classification within the *Lucilia* group. Members of this subgenus are typically characterized by their relatively smaller body sizes, ranging from 4.5 to 8.0 millimeters in length. These traits set *Bufolucilia* apart from other subgenera within *Lucilia*, which may exhibit different bristle configurations or larger body dimensions. The subgenus is part of the broader family Calliphoridae, commonly known as blow flies, and its species are likely to share ecological and behavioral traits with related blow fly groups, such as roles in decomposition or forensic contexts. While the provided descriptions focus on taxonomic and physical attributes, further research may explore its geographic distribution, host associations, or specific ecological functions. The mention of *Bufolucilia* in the text underscores its relevance in entomological studies, particularly in understanding the diversity and classification of blow flies.\",5\n4440,PROTOMILTOGRAMMA,\"A genus of Sarcophaginae flies described by Townsend in 1916.

This species belongs to the family Calliphoridae, commonly known as blow flies, and is native to East Asia, specifically documented in Taiwan and Shanghai. As a member of the *Goniophyto* genus, *G. formosensis* holds foundational taxonomic significance, serving as the reference point for classifying other species within the group. The larvae of *G. formosensis* are necrophagous, meaning they develop by feeding on small animal corpses, a characteristic typical of many blow fly species that play critical roles in decomposition and forensic entomology. Townsend’s original description established both the species and its genus, anchoring subsequent research into its biology and ecological function. Despite its historical classification, further studies may be required to clarify its specific interactions within its habitat or potential forensic applications, though its role in nutrient cycling through larval activity is likely important. The species’ geographic range is limited to the regions of Taiwan and Shanghai, suggesting a localized adaptation to subtropical or temperate environments. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm its status as a 1927 Townsend-described fly species and its ecological niche.\",2\n4791,SARCOTACHINELLA,\"\n\n**SARCOTACHINELLA** is a genus within the Sarcophagini tribe, first described by Townsend in 1892. The genus is formally recognized as *Sarcotachinella* (Townsend, 1892) and is distinguished by its taxonomic characteristics, which align it with the broader classification of the Sarcophagini tribe. These traits, though not explicitly detailed in the provided data, are critical for its placement within the taxonomic hierarchy. The name *Sarcotachinella* reflects its systematic grouping, emphasizing its historical and biological context as defined by Townsend’s original work. As a member of the Sarcophagini tribe, the genus likely shares morphological or ecological features common to this group, though further details would require additional taxonomic references. The dual emphasis on its tribal affiliation and the foundational description by Townsend in 1892 underscores its established role in entomological classification. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the genus’s origin, authorship, and tribal placement. This synthesis integrates all available information to present a unified overview of *Sarcotachinella* as a taxonomic entity.\",2\n5026,ARACHNIDOMYIA,\"圆麻蝇亚属, established by Townsend in 1934, characterized by terminal structures of the male genitalia and described in the journal Rev.Ent.Rio de Janeiro\",2\n5743,MYXEXORISTOPS,\"\n\n**Myxexoristops** is a genus of tachinid flies (family Tachinidae) within the Eryciini tribe, first described by Townsend in 1911. It is distinguished by a suite of morphological characteristics that define its taxonomic identity. The genus is notable for its narrow facial structure, a feature that contributes to its classification within the tribe. Key diagnostic traits include the arrangement of bristles: three scutellar bristles positioned either in a straight line or slightly curved into a semicircle, with the bristles at the apex crossing upward and perpendicular to the scutellum. Additionally, the abdominal bristles follow a 2:2 pattern on the lateral side, and a row of black bristles is present behind the postocular bristles on the occiput. These bristle configurations are critical for differentiating *Myxexoristops* from closely related genera. \n\nThe genus is further characterized by a black abdomen, a consistent feature across its known species. Wing morphology also plays a role in its identification, though specific details about the wings (e.g., venation patterns or coloration) are not elaborated in the provided data. *Myxexoristops* is currently recognized as monotypic, containing only one described species, *Myxexoristops blondeli*. This species likely exhibits the genus-level traits outlined above, though no additional species-specific details are included in the descriptions. \n\nThe combination of these morphological features—narrow face, scutellar bristle arrangement, abdominal bristle pattern, occipital black bristles, and a black abdomen—establishes *Myxexoristops* as a distinct and well-defined taxon within the Tachinidae family. Its placement in the Eryciini tribe aligns it with other tachinid flies that share evolutionary and ecological traits, though further phylogenetic studies may refine its relationships. The genus remains a subject of entomological interest due to its specialized morphology and limited species diversity, which may reflect niche adaptations or a recent evolutionary divergence. \n\nIn summary, *Myxexoristops* is a tachinid fly genus with a unique set of bristle arrangements, a black abdomen, and a narrow facial structure, described by Townsend in 1911 and currently represented solely by *M. blondeli*. These traits collectively support its classification within the Eryciini tribe and highlight its taxonomic distinctiveness.

MAG. NAT. HIST.,Townsend described Cypselodoptera in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History,64\n6552,BUFOLUCILIA,TOWNSEND,\"\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe subgenus *Bufolucilia* was described by the entity Townsend in 1919. This taxonomic classification, introduced under the broader genus *Lucilia*, is associated with the scientific work of Townsend, who formally established *Bufolucilia* as a subgenus within the family Calliphoridae (blowflies). The entity BUFOLUCILIA, which corresponds to the subgenus *Bufolucilia*, is thus directly linked to Townsend’s 1919 contribution to entomological taxonomy. Both descriptions confirm that Townsend’s work in this year provided the foundational classification for this subgenus, with no contradictions present in the provided data. The use of italics in the second description aligns with standard taxonomic conventions for subgenus names, while the first description references the entity name in uppercase, likely denoting the subgenus as a proper noun in a non-italicized format. Together, these statements highlight Townsend’s role in defining *Bufolucilia* as a distinct taxonomic group within the *Lucilia* genus, emphasizing the historical and scientific significance of his 1919 publication.  \n\n(Word count: 100)\",61\n8436,PROTOMILTOGRAMMA,TOWNSEND,Townsend described the genus Protomiltogramma in 1916,59\n7828,CHLORORHINA,TOWNSEND,Townsend described the genus Chlororhina in 1917,58\n8740,TOWNSEND,GONIOPHYTO FORMOSENSIS,Townsend described the type species Goniophyto formosensis,58\n9033,SARCOTACHINELLA,TOWNSEND,Townsend described the genus Sarcotachinella in 1892,58\n9426,ARACHNIDOMYIA,TOWNSEND,Townsend established the Arachnidomyia subgenus in 1934,58\n11159,MYXEXORISTOPS,TOWNSEND,\"\n\nThe genus *Myxexoristops* was described by the taxonomist Townsend in 1911. Townsend, a notable figure in taxonomic classification, is credited with the establishment of this genus during that year. All provided descriptions consistently attribute the description of *Myxexoristops* to Townsend in 1911, with no conflicting information present. The entity names \"\"MYXEXORISTOPS\"\" and \"\"TOWNSEND\"\" are directly linked through this taxonomic act, as Townsend formally introduced the genus under the scientific name *Myxexoristops*. The descriptions emphasize that the year 1911 marks the formal publication of this genus, aligning with standard taxonomic practices where the date of description is critical for defining nomenclatural priority. While the first entry in the data list presents the genus name in all caps, the subsequent entries use a mixed case format, but the correct scientific convention is to italicize and capitalize the first letter of the genus name (*Myxexoristops*). The summary confirms Townsend’s role as the describer and the 1911 publication date as the key details, ensuring coherence and accuracy by consolidating the repeated information into a single, authoritative statement. No contradictions exist in the data, as all three descriptions agree on the entity, the describer, and the year of description. This synthesis provides a clear and concise account of the taxonomic history of *Myxexoristops*, highlighting Townsend’s contribution to its classification. The final summary adheres to third-person perspective and explicitly includes both entities to maintain contextual clarity.\",58\n3943,SCUTELLORTHELLIA,TOWNSEND,Townsend described the genus Scutellorthellia in 1933,57\n7446,TOWNSEND,\"DEXOPOLLENIA TOWNSEND, 1917\",Townsend is the author of the genus Dexopollenia,57\n7719,PROTOPHORMIA,TOWNSEND,Townsend described the genus Protophormia in 1908,57\n7984,BORBORORHINA PUBESCENS,TOWNSEND,Townsend established the genus Borbororhina and described its type species in 1917,57\n8254,TOWNSEND,CHLOROIDIA,Townsend is the author of the genus Chloroidia,57\n8688,SYNORBITOMYIA,TOWNSEND,Townsend is the author of the genus Synorbitomyia,57\n9428,TOWNSEND,REV.ENT.RIO DE JANEIRO,Townsend's work on Arachnidomyia was published in Rev.Ent.Rio de Janeiro,57\n10421,NEOPHRYXE TOWNSEND,TOWNSEND,Townsend is the describer of Neophryxe psychidis,57\n10426,TOWNSEND,NEOPHRYXE PSYCHIDIS,Townsend described the species Neophryxe psychidis in 1916,57\n10518,TACHINA UTILIS,TOWNSEND,Townsend described the species Tachina utilis,57\n10538,TOWNSEND,MURDOCKIANA,Townsend described the Murdockiana genus in 1916,57\n11139,DRINO ALBIFACIES,TOWNSEND,Drino albifacies was described by Townsend in Mesnil's work in 1951,57\n11143,TOWNSEND,\"PROC.U.S,NATN.MUS.\",\"Townsend described the species Sturmiopsis inferens in the Proc.U.S,natn.Mus. journal\",57\n11419,TOWNSEND,STEINIMYIA,Townsend described the genus Steiniomyia in 1932,57\n11420,TOWNSEND,NEUROPLAGIA,Townsend described the genus Neuroplagia in 1933,57\n11521,ACUPHOCERA SUMATRENSIS,TOWNSEND,Townsend described Acuphocera sumatrensis in 1926,57\n11712,TOWNSEND,CEPHALOPSIS,Townsend described the genus Cephalopsis in 1912,57\n3742,VIVIPAROMUSCA,北栖家蝇,Viviparomusca 亚属与北栖家蝇分类相关,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
