The larvae of *Lymantria monacha* are specifically noted to be parasitized by *Robineauella pseudoscoparia*, a species of parasitic wasp (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), which plays a role in regulating their populations. Additionally, the moth serves as a host for *Parasetigena silvestris*, a fly (Diptera: Tachinidae), with the species being highlighted as a model for the genus *Parasetigena* in studies of host-parasitoid interactions. Another tachinid fly, *Drino inconspicua*, is also cited in literature as a parasitoid of *Lymantria monacha*, further emphasizing the moth's ecological significance in supporting diverse parasitic relationships. These interactions underscore the moth's role in biological control systems and its importance in research on parasitism and host specificity.
