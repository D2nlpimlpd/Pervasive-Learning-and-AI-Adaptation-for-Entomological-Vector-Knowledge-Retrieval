It is home to a wide array of dipteran fauna, including *Pygophora respondens* and *Pectiniseta pectinata*, as well as *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, and *Musca seniorwhitei*. The APICALIS and FLAVOCAUDATA *Dichaetomyia* species are also documented there, with Luzon Island noted as the type locality for *Dichaetomyia quadrata*. Additionally, the Philippines hosts *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, the Star Island Greenbottle Fly, *Anthomyia illocata*, *Anthomyia plumiseta*, and the Indian greenbottle fly (*Chrysomya megacephala*), though the latter’s common name may imply regional overlap.  \n\nThe country supports species such as *Bengalia* (genus-level mention), *Borbororhina bivittata*, and *Borbororhinia bivittata*, which are often associated with its tropical ecosystems. *Helina hirtifemorata* and *Hemipyrellia liguriens* are further examples, with Luzon Island identified as the type locality for the former. *Rhyncomya setipyga*, *Strongyloneura prasina*, and *Tainanina pilisquama* and *Tainanina sarcophagoides* are also native to the region. The genus *Winthemia* and *Chlororhinia exempta* are present, while *Ophyra chalcogaster* and *Lixophaga parva* are naturally distributed there.  \n\nNotably, the Philippines is a foreign distribution record for certain species, such as *Musca crassirostris* and *Sarcosolomonia crinita*, indicating its role as an outlier in their global ranges. The Chinese-named species \"\"1340杯细麻蝇\"\" (likely *Musca cupripes*) and *Myospila flavibasis* are also reported, though the former’s inclusion may reflect regional taxonomic practices. The genus *Emmesomyia* is distributed across the archipelago, and Palawan, one of its islands, is highlighted as a distinct ecological zone.  \n\nThis summary consolidates the Philippines’ significance as a hub for diverse fly species, emphasizing both its native and foreign distribution records. The country’s unique geography, including Luzon and Palawan, contributes to the presence of type localities and specialized habitats for these insects. While some descriptions reference the Philippines as a \"\"foreign location,\"\" this likely pertains to species whose primary ranges lie elsewhere, underscoring the archipelago’s ecological connectivity and role in broader biogeographic patterns. The data collectively paint the Philippines as a critical region for studying dipteran diversity, with implications for taxonomy, conservation, and ecological research.\",35\n3021,DICHAEATOMYIA FEMORATA,,4\n3022,DICHAEATOMYIA PECTINIPES,,4\n3023,DICHAEATOMYIA PALLITARSIS,,4\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3731,PHILIPPINES,毛瓣家蝇,菲律宾是毛瓣家蝇的国外分布区域,50\n5400,PHILIPPINES,DICHAEATOMYIA FEMORATA,The species is distributed in the Philippines,39\n5401,PHILIPPINES,DICHAEATOMYIA PECTINIPES,The species is distributed in the Philippines,39\n5402,PHILIPPINES,DICHAEATOMYIA PALLITARSIS,The species is distributed in the Philippines,39\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
