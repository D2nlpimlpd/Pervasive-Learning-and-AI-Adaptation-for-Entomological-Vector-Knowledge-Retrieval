A further contribution includes the description of the species *Coelomyia mollissima* in 1840, which predates the formal establishment of the *Coelomyia* genus by five years. This discrepancy in dates suggests that *Coelomyia mollissima* may have initially been described under a different genus or nomenclatural context before being later assigned to *Coelomyia* as part of taxonomic revisions. HALIDAY’s work spans both genus-level and species-level classifications, with key dates marking their contributions to the scientific understanding of these taxa. The entity’s role as a describer is central to the nomenclatural history of these groups, though the timeline of *Coelomyia*’s genus and species descriptions requires clarification to reconcile the 1840 and 1845 dates.

He is credited as the author of *Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes*, a species cited in the *Insect Research Journal*. Additionally, STROBL described the genus *Platycoenosia* in 1894, contributing to the classification of flies within this group. In 1898, he formally described the species *Delia longicauda*, which is part of the Delia genus. His work also includes the 1909 description of *Meigenia rubromaculata*, where he played a role in refining the taxonomy of the *Meigenia* genus. Furthermore, STROBL is noted as the scholar who described *Ph. jugorum* (likely *Phaonia jugorum* or a similar species, though the full binomial is not provided in the data).  \n\nHowever, there is a historical inaccuracy in the attribution of *Lispocephala miki* (1893), where STROBL’s name was incorrectly used as the author. This suggests a possible confusion or miscitation in taxonomic records for that species. Despite this error, his contributions to entomology remain significant, spanning the late 19th and early 20th centuries. STROBL’s work appears to focus on Diptera, particularly flies, with a notable emphasis on species and genus-level classifications. His descriptions of *Delia longicauda* and *Platycoenosia* highlight his role in organizing and naming these taxa, while his 1909 study of *Meigenia rubromaculata* underscores his engagement with the *Meigenia* genus. The mention of *Ph. jugorum* further indicates his involvement in documenting diverse fly species, though the exact context of this work is less detailed.  \n\nThe data reveals STROBL’s active participation in taxonomic research during the 1890s and 1900s, with a focus on morphological and systematic studies of flies. His work in 1894 on *Platycoenosia* and 1898 on *Delia longicauda* aligns with the broader scientific efforts of the era to catalog and classify insect biodiversity. The 1909 description of *Meigenia rubromaculata* reflects his continued contributions to the field. While the incorrect citation of *Lispocephala miki* (1893) raises questions about the accuracy of some records, the majority of his documented work is consistent and well-supported. STROBL’s legacy includes foundational taxonomic descriptions that remain referenced in entomological literature, such as the *Insect Research Journal*.  \n\nIn summary, STROBL is recognized as a key figure in the classification of Diptera, with notable works on *Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes*, *Delia longicauda*, *Meigenia rubromaculata*, and the genus *Platycoenosia*. His contributions to the *Meigenia* genus and the description of *Ph. jugorum* further solidify his role in advancing the understanding of fly taxonomy. The misattribution of *Lispocephala miki* (1893) serves as a cautionary note about the importance of verifying historical taxonomic records.

Key characteristics include a **flagellum lacking plumose bristles**, a feature that differentiates it from related genera. Males of the genus are further marked by a **broad frons**, a distinct facial structure. Additionally, Euryomma species exhibit a **bare arista** (a hair-like appendage at the end of the antenna, referred to as *antennal芒* in the original description) and **short genal bristles**, which are sensory hairs on the cheeks. The genus is also notable for its **specific wing venation pattern**, a critical diagnostic feature in dipteran taxonomy.

The genus is characterized by distinct morphological features that aid in its taxonomic identification. Notably, male specimens of *Piezura* exhibit a **narrow frons** (the forehead region of the head), a trait that differentiates them from other genera in the subfamily. Additionally, the **subcostal vein** in the wings of *Piezura* is described as **non-arched**, which contrasts with the arched subcostal vein observed in some related genera. These wing venation patterns are critical for classification within the Fanniinae, as they often serve as key diagnostic markers.  \n\nBeyond wing venation, *Piezura* is further distinguished by its **bristle arrangements**. The specific distribution and morphology of bristles on the body and wings are unique to this genus, contributing to its identification in entomological studies. These bristle patterns, combined with the wing venation traits, provide a comprehensive framework for differentiating *Piezura* from other genera in the subfamily.  \n\nThe Fanniinae subfamily, to which *Piezura* belongs, is part of the family Syrphidae (hoverflies), a group known for their ecological roles as pollinators and their morphological diversity. While the genus is relatively small in species count compared to other Fanniinae genera, its defining characteristics—particularly the narrow male frons and non-arched subcostal vein—have been consistently highlighted in taxonomic literature. These features are not only diagnostic for *Piezura* but also reflect evolutionary adaptations within the subfamily.  \n\nIn summary, *Piezura* is a well-defined genus in the Fanniinae subfamily, characterized by a combination of a narrow male frons, non-arched subcostal wing veins, and distinctive bristle arrangements. These traits, first documented by Rondani in 1866, remain central to its classification and distinguish it from other genera in the group.
