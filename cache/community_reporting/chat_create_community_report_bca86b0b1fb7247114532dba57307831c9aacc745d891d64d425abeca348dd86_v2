It serves as a type locality in Qinghai for *Phaonia decussatoides*, a species first described from this region. The area is associated with the distribution of multiple genera and species, including *Delia spicularis*, *Chaetogena gynacphorae*, *Helina truncata*, and *Onesiomima pamirica*. Additionally, Yushu is linked to the presence of *Helina brunneipalpis* and *Gonia klapperichi*, further highlighting its biodiversity. The genera *Zaira* and *Meigenia* are also documented as being distributed in Yushu, contributing to its role as a hub for entomological study. While some descriptions refer to Yushu as a \"\"city\"\" and others as a \"\"county,\"\" this reflects its administrative classification as a county-level city within Qinghai Province, a common structure in China where such cities function as both urban centers and county jurisdictions. The repeated emphasis on Qinghai Province underscores the region’s ecological importance, particularly in the context of fly species habitats. Yushu’s association with these taxa suggests it is a key location for research into their taxonomy, behavior, and environmental adaptations.
