It is home to a diverse array of flies, including **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Atherigona reversura**, **Musca convexifrons** (found in Chong’an and Zhangzhou), **Musca malaisei**, **Servillia planiforceps**, and **Isomyia trimuricata** (whose type locality is recorded in Nanjing Hexi, Jiangsu, but is also distributed in Fujian). The province hosts species such as **Chrysomya pinguis**, **Chrysomya megacephala**, and **Chrysomya bezziana**, with specific localities including Fuzhou, Anxi, Dehua, Huian, Quanzhou, Jinjiang, and Xiamen. Additionally, **Musca crassirostris**, **Anthomyia illocata**, **Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum**, **Pegomya spinulosa**, **Pegomya bicolor**, **Siphona cristata**, **Stomorhina obsoleta**, **Gymnadichosia pusilla**, **Dasychira baibaran**, **Gonia klapperichi**, **Gonia bimaculata**, **Dolichocolon klapperichi**, **Miltogramma iberium**, and **Brontaea tonitrui** are all documented in Fujian.  \n\nFujian is also associated with the distribution of the **FLY GENUS** and the **genus Adia**, **Vibrissina Rondani**, and **Haematobia**. Specific species like **985瓣腹绿蝇** (Guzhu), **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**, **1393义乌亚麻蝇** (Yiwu submarmal fly), **蓝黑栉寄蝇** (Pales pavida and Sisyropa prominens), **秉氏亚麻蝇** (Bing’s submarmal fly), and **棕尾别麻蝇** (a Chinese species name) are recorded there. The province supports **Isomyia isomyia**, **Isomyia electa**, and **Isomyia viridaurea**, as well as **Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri** (Jianyang Changxian) and other **Bengalia** species. **Meigenia grandigena** and **Meigenia majuscula** are also present, alongside **Achoetandrus rufifacies** in Xiamen and Fuzhou.  \n\nFujian’s role in entomological studies is highlighted by its inclusion in research on **tachinid flies** and the **Shuangban Jiewei Jiying** (a species linked to host studies). The province is further noted for **Musca conducens**, **Musca sorbens**, and **614裸蹠芒蝇** (a Chinese species name). Specific locations within Fujian, such as Jianyang Dazhulan, Nanping, and Xiamen, are tied to **Graphomya rufitibia** and **Hemipyrellia liguriens**, while **Carcelia kockiana** and **Parasarcophaga brevicornis** are part of its broader fly fauna.  \n\nThis summary consolidates Fujian’s status as a critical region for fly biodiversity in China, emphasizing its varied habitats and the presence of both common and specialized species. Contradictions in the data, such as the type locality of *Isomyia trimuricata* being in Jiangsu (Nanjing Hexi) but the species also occurring in Fujian, are resolved by noting the species’ distribution in Fujian while acknowledging the type locality’s correct regional attribution.
