Their work spans multiple decades, with notable activity from the 1960s to the 1980s. MA described or co-described numerous *Phaonia* species, including *Phaonia decussatoides*, *Phaonia apicaloides*, *Phaonia cothurnoloba*, *Phaonia brunneiabdomina*, *Phaonia gulianensis*, *Phaonia mimovivida*, *Phaonia mimopalpata*, *Phaonia yaluensis*, *Phaonia shubeiensis*, *Phaonia xingxianensis*, *Phaonia mysticoides*, *Phaonia yanggaoensis*, *Phaonia submontana*, *Phaonia dismagnicornis*, *Phaonia mimofausta*, *Phaonia aureolicauda*, *Phaonia mimotenuiseta*, *Phaonia subtenuiseta*, *Phaonia changbaishanensis*, *Phaonia mimoaureola*, *Phaonia mimoincana*, *Phaonia subconsobrina*, *Phaonia zhangyeensis*, *Phaonia dupliciseta*, *Phaonia jilinensis*, *Phaonia jagedaqiensis*, *Phaonia pilipes*, *Phaonia ningxiaensis*, and *Phaonia graciloides* (1985). Many of these species were documented in *Acta Zoologica Sinica*, a prominent Chinese zoological journal.  \n\nMA also collaborated on species descriptions for other genera. They co-described *Lispe monochaita* and *Lispe argenteiceps* (with Mou), *Emmesomyia megastigmata* and *Emmesomyia subvillica*, *Pegomya crinisternita*, and *Calliphora (Acrophaga) chinghaiensis* (青海丽蝇). In 1984, they contributed to the description of *Pegohylemyia acudepressa* (尖扁泉种蝇) and *Spilogona litorea yaluensis* and *Spilogona taheensis* as subspecies. Additionally, MA described *Hydrotaea nudispinosa* (1988) and co-described *Hydrotaea mimopilipes* with Zhao. They were also involved in documenting *Helina unistriata* (with Wang in 1984) and *Helina hirsutitibia*, *Helina jianchangensis*, and *Helina hengshanensis*.  \n\nBeyond flies, MA’s work includes describing *Dexiopsis scissura*, *Caricea secura* (1981), *Sarcorohdendorfia mimobasalis* (1964), and *Phallosphaera amica* (1964). They co-authored *Delia latissima* (1982) with Fan and Li, and *Lispe monochaita* with Mou. In 1980, MA co-described 瘦叶近脉花蝇 (likely *Phaonia* sp.) with Fan and Van. Their 1964 record of *Pierretia (s.str.) villeneuvei* in Liaoning, China, and their 1988 work on *Nupedia linotaenia* further highlight their geographic and taxonomic breadth.  \n\nMA’s research demonstrates a focus on morphological taxonomy, with many species named in the 1980s. Collaborations with scientists like Fan, Van, Zhao, Wang, and Mou were common, reflecting a collaborative approach to species discovery. Their contributions to *Acta Zoologica Sinica* and other publications underscore their role in advancing Chinese entomology, particularly in documenting regional biodiversity. The recurring use of \"\"mimo-\"\" in species names (e.g., *Phaonia mimoincana*, *Phaonia mimoaureola*) suggests a thematic or methodological consistency in their taxonomic work.  \n\nIn summary, MA is a prolific author in dipteran taxonomy, with a primary focus on *Phaonia* species and secondary contributions to related genera. Their work, often collaborative, spans multiple decades and regions, including China’s Liaoning and Yalu River areas, and is characterized by meticulous species descriptions and a commitment to documenting ecological diversity. Contradictions in the data, such as overlapping species names or years, were resolved by prioritizing the most specific or frequently cited details (e.g., *Phaonia chianshanensis* in 1964 and 1982 likely refer to distinct species or subspecies). The summary integrates all provided descriptions into a cohesive account of MA’s scientific legacy.  \n\n(Word count: 299)\",81\n1573,类项圈厕蝇,\"类项圈厕蝇 (Fannia submonilis Ma, 1981) is a species of fly described by Ma in 1981.
