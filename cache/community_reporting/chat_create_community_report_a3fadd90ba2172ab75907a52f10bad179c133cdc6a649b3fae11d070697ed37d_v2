It is characterized by a distinct morphological feature: a 1:0 ratio of postnotal bristles, which is a key diagnostic trait distinguishing it from other subspecies within the *P. japonica* complex. The body length of *P. japonica mokanensis* is approximately 5 mm, providing a standard reference for its size relative to related species. This subspecies is geographically distributed in Zhejiang Province, China, and Japan, indicating its presence in both regions. While the primary description emphasizes its taxonomic classification as a subspecies and specific anatomical markers, the secondary account aligns with these details but focuses on its broader identification as a fly species and its regional occurrence. The combination of these data clarifies that *P. japonica mokanensis* is a well-defined subspecies within the *P. japonica* group, notable for its unique bristle pattern and moderate size, and is native to East Asia.
