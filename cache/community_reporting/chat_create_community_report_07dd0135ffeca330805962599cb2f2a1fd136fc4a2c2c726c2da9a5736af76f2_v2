They have collaborated with Ma on multiple occasions, co-describing *Phaonia ningxiaensis* and *Hydrotaea mimopilipes*. ZHAO is also an author of *Phaonia pallatoides*, with a specific 1985 publication noted in the description list. Additionally, they co-authored the description of *Phaonia wenshuiensis*, which was published in the journal *Acta Zoologica Sinica*. Another key contribution includes the description of *Phaonia subnigrisquama*, further demonstrating their expertise in this field. ZHAO is further acknowledged as one of the scientists who described *Phaonia helanensis* (贺兰山欧麻蝇), a species associated with the Helan Mountains. These works collectively highlight ZHAO’s role in advancing the classification and understanding of these fly species through collaborative research and publications in entomological literature. Their partnerships, particularly with Ma, and their involvement in both *Phaonia* and *Hydrotaea* genera underscore their interdisciplinary and cooperative approach to taxonomic studies. The 1985 date for *Phaonia pallatoides* provides a temporal reference for one of their key publications, while the inclusion of *Acta Zoologica Sinica* emphasizes their engagement with prominent scientific journals. ZHAO’s body of work reflects a focus on regional biodiversity, particularly in China, and their descriptions have likely supported ecological and biological research in entomology. The consistency across the descriptions—despite variations in phrasing—confirms ZHAO’s active participation in these taxonomic efforts, with no contradictory claims identified. Their contributions remain foundational to the study of these species, offering critical insights into their morphology, distribution, and classification.\",7\n3399,PHANOIA PALLATOIDES,\"A species of fly described by Xue and Zhao in 1985, with distribution in Hebei, China\",5\n3514,PHANONIA BEIZHENESIS,,4\n3400,ACTA ZOOLOGICA,Journal where Phaonia pallatoides was published in 1985,1\n3401,FUPING,\"\n\nFUPING is a location in Hebei Province, China, recognized as the type locality for two species within the genus *Phaonia*: *Phaonia subnigrisquama* and *Phaonia pallatoides*.

For *Phaonia subnigrisquama*, FUPING is explicitly noted as the type locality, indicating that the species was initially documented there. Similarly, FUPING is identified as the type locality for *Phaonia pallatoides*, further establishing its significance in the study of these dipteran insects. The descriptions provided are consistent, with all three entries confirming FUPING’s role in Hebei Province as the origin point for the taxonomic records of these two *Phaonia* species. No contradictions exist among the data, as each description aligns in specifying the location and its association with the respective species.
