It is renowned for its unique geographical and ecological significance, particularly as a habitat for specific fly species. The area is associated with **Isomyia pseudolucilia**, a species within the genus *Isomyia*, which is part of the blow fly family (Calliphoridae). This connection highlights 墨脱's role in biodiversity studies, as such species are often indicators of environmental conditions or forensic interest. Additionally, 墨脱 is home to **Delia echinata**, a member of the Delia genus in the fly family Anthomyiidae, which is typically linked to agricultural or ecological research due to its interactions with plants.  \n\nAs a remote and ecologically diverse region, 墨脱 is situated near the border with India and Nepal, within the Himalayan foothills. Its high-altitude terrain and subtropical climate create a distinct ecosystem that supports a range of flora and fauna, including these notable fly species. The presence of both *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Delia echinata* in 墨脱 underscores the area’s importance for entomological studies, offering insights into species distribution and adaptation in challenging environments.  \n\nThe county has also been historically significant for its inaccessibility, as it was once one of the last regions in China to be connected by a road, completed in 2013. This isolation may have contributed to the preservation of its unique ecological characteristics, including the habitats of these fly species. While the descriptions provided focus on entomological associations, 墨脱’s broader context as a culturally and geographically distinct part of Tibet further enriches its profile as a site of scientific and geographical interest.  \n\nIn summary, 墨脱 (Mudan) is a Tibetan county notable for its ecological niche, supporting both *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Delia echinata*, and for its strategic location in the Himalayas.
