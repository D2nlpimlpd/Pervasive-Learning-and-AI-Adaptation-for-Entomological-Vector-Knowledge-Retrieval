Other localities within the province, such as **Hangzhou**, **Jiangshan**, **Moganshan**, **Yiwu**, and **Zhoushan**, are also highlighted for their biodiversity. For example, **Moganshan** is noted for **Meigenia grandigena**, while **Hangzhou** is linked to **Graphomya rufitibia**, **Calliphora axata**, and **Muscidae subfamilies**. \n\nThe province supports diverse ecological interactions, including species associated with agricultural pests like the **Rice Borer** and **Rice Leafroller Moth**. Zhejiang’s fauna includes **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Parasarcophaga brevicornis**, **Parasarcophaga macroauriculata**, and **Parasarcophaga polystylata**, as well as **Sarcophaga species**, **Leucophora hangzhouensis**, **Haematobia**, and **Nupedia fulva**. The **Pegomya** genus is well-represented, with species such as **Pegomya spinulosa**, **Pegomya phyllostachys**, **Pegomya pachura**, **Pegomya clavellata**, and **Pegomya japonica mokanensis**. Additionally, **Gonia klapperichi**, **Gonia chinensis**, **Gonia bimaculata**, and **Bengalia species** are documented in Zhejiang, alongside **Miltogramma iberium** and **Exorista larvarum**. \n\nZhejiang’s role as a type locality is emphasized for **1393义乌亚麻蝇** (Yiwu Bristle Fly) and **Syngamoptera chekiangensis**, underscoring its importance in entomological research. The province also records **Brontaea tonitrui**, **Actia nigroscutellata**, **Bellardia menechmoides** (Beiyeyangdangshan), **Dasychira baibaran**, **Enneastigma shanghaiensis**, and **Servillia ardens**. Notably, **Tachina nupta** and **Tachina noctuarum** are found here, as are **1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly** and **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**. \n\nIn summary, Zhejiang is a critical hub for fly biodiversity in China, characterized by its varied habitats and the presence of both common and specialized species. Key locations like Tianmu Mountain, Hangzhou, and Yiwu serve as focal points for entomological studies, while the province’s ecological diversity supports interactions with agricultural pests and hosts a range of genera and species with scientific and local significance.

Contrary to a conflicting description that incorrectly identifies it as a city, Mogansan is a natural landscape characterized by lush bamboo forests, scenic valleys, and a subtropical climate, making it a notable tourist destination and a hub for environmental research. The area is part of the documented distribution range for two species of flies: *Isomyia pichoni* and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, which are likely associated with the region’s specific habitats, such as its dense vegetation or microclimates. Additionally, Mogansan has been modeled as a key location for *Pegomya japonica mokanensis*, a subspecies of the Pegomya fly, further underscoring its role in entomological studies. These species, all within the family of flies (Diptera), highlight the region’s importance as a biodiversity hotspot, particularly for insects that may rely on the unique ecological conditions of the mountain. The discrepancies in the data—such as the misclassification of Mogansan as a city—are resolved by confirming its status as a geographic and ecological site rather than an urban center. Its inclusion in species distribution models and records reflects its value in understanding the biogeography and habitat preferences of these organisms.

This species is characterized by distinct morphological features that aid in its identification. Notably, it possesses a cluster of over ten small spines located on the posterior ventral proximal part of the hind tibia, a key diagnostic trait. The second antennal segment is predominantly yellow, contributing to its visual differentiation from related species. Additionally, the fly exhibits a unique bristle pattern, with no small bristles present except for three pairs, which are likely arranged in a specific configuration. Another distinguishing feature is the presence of a median projection on the posterior edge of the fifth abdominal plate, further setting it apart taxonomically. The body length of *Pegomya spinulosa* ranges between 6 and 8.5 millimeters, placing it within the typical size range for members of its genus. \n\nGeographically, *Pegomya spinulosa* is native to China, where it has been documented in the provinces of Zhejiang, Hunan (specifically in the Mangshan region), and Fujian. These regions are known for their diverse ecosystems, which may support the species' ecological niche. The combination of its morphological traits and restricted distribution provides critical context for entomological studies and biodiversity assessments. \n\nBy integrating the physical attributes outlined in the first description with the geographic data from the second, this summary offers a holistic overview of *Pegomya spinulosa*, ensuring clarity and coherence while adhering to the provided constraints.\",6\n5916,KIRBY,Kirby is the describer of the species Echinomyia micado in 1884,1\n1407,TIANMU MOUNTAIN,\"\n\nTIANMU MOUNTAIN is a geographical location situated in Zhejiang Province, China, and is recognized as a significant site for biodiversity and entomological research.
