Males are notable for their narrow foreheads and the presence of interfrontal bristles, while females exhibit distinct abdominal structures. A key diagnostic feature of the genus is the male fifth abdominal segment, which bears a single bristle on its anterior margin and plates with inner flaps, as described by Landia Hennig (1973) and Suwa (1974). Additionally, the anal tail leaf in Meliniella species often ends with an inward curl, further differentiating them from related genera. The genus is also characterized by the absence of certain bristles, such as those found in *Shakshainia* (Suwa) and *Craspedochoeta* (Macq.), and by narrower postabdominal side lobes compared to these genera. \n\nSpecies within *Meliniella* include *Meliniella sikisima* and *Meliniella griseifrons*, which exemplify the genus’s defining traits. The body length of these flies typically ranges from 4.5 to 9.0 mm, as noted in comparative studies. The male abdominal morphology is particularly critical for identification, with the fifth abdominal plates featuring inner flaps and side tail leaf inner branches, which are absent in the genera used for differentiation. These structural details, combined with the narrow postabdominal side lobes, provide a clear taxonomic basis for separating *Meliniella* from *Shakshainia* and *Craspedochoeta*. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize the importance of abdominal and bristle-related features in distinguishing *Meliniella* from closely related taxa. While the first description highlights the absence of specific bristles and narrower side lobes, the second and third descriptions elaborate on the male-specific traits, such as the single bristle on the fifth abdominal segment and the inward curling anal tail leaf. These features are consistent across the provided sources, with no direct contradictions. The references to Landia Hennig (1973) and Suwa (1974) underscore the historical context of the genus’s taxonomic classification. \n\nIn summary, *Meliniella* is a fly genus defined by male morphological traits including a narrow forehead, interfrontal bristles, a single bristle on the fifth abdominal segment, and abdominal plates with inner flaps and side tail leaf inner branches. The inward curling of the anal tail leaf and narrower postabdominal side lobes further distinguish it from *Shakshainia* and *Craspedochoeta*. With species like *M. sikisima* and *M. griseifrons*, the genus is well-characterized by its unique anatomical features and size range, making it a distinct group within the fly family.\",10\n695,MELINIELLA SIKISIMA,\"The type species of the genus Meliniella, described by Suwa in 1974.

MATS.** (short for *Insecta Mats*) is an entomological journal recognized for its contributions to the study of insect taxonomy and systematics. The publication has served as a platform for describing and documenting new genera and species within the insect order Diptera (true flies). Notably, it is the journal where Japanese entomologist **Takumi Suwa** formally described the genus *Meliniella* in 1974, marking a significant addition to the classification of flies within the family Stratiomyidae (soldier flies). Additionally, *Insecta Mats* has featured detailed taxonomic work on the genus *Pegohylemyia*, a group of aquatic or semi-aquatic flies in the family Hylemyiidae, further establishing its role in advancing knowledge of lesser-known dipteran taxa. The journal’s focus on specialized entomological research highlights its importance in the scientific community for publishing rigorous, peer-reviewed studies on insect morphology, ecology, and evolutionary relationships. By consolidating descriptions of both *Meliniella* and *Pegohylemyia*, *Insecta Mats* underscores its commitment to documenting biodiversity and supporting taxonomic revisions in entomology. Its historical contributions, particularly Suwa’s 1974 work, remain foundational for subsequent research on these genera. The journal’s abbreviated form, **INS. MATS.**, is commonly used in citations and references to streamline academic discourse while maintaining clarity about its identity as a dedicated entomological publication. Through its publications, *Insecta Mats* has contributed to the broader understanding of insect classification, providing critical insights into the phylogeny and distribution of species within the Diptera order.\",2\n469,LANDIA HENNIG,\"Landia Hennig is a person associated with the genus Meliniella, described in 1973\",1\n470,MELINIELLA SUWA,Meliniella Suwa is a person who described the genus Meliniella in 1974,1\n706,SHAKSHAINIA SUWA,,1\n707,CRASPEDECHOETA MACQ,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n392,MELINIELLA,SUWA,Suwa is the taxonomist who described the genus Meliniella,45\n698,MELINIELLA SIKISIMA,SUWA,SUWA described MELINIELLA SIKISIMA in 1974,37\n689,INS.
