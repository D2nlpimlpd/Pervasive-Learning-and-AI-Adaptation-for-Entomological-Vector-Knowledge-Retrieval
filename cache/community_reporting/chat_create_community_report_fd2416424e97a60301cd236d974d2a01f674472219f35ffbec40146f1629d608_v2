He was cited in 1951 for his foundational work on fly taxonomy, which provided critical classifications for the field. In 1954, he expanded his research by contributing to the classification of *Metopia* subgenera, a study that also included a bristle pattern comparison referenced in Figure A49. This work on *Metopia* subgenera further solidified his expertise in dipteran systematics. Additionally, Van Emden’s research has been referenced for describing the morphological features of three major fly superfamilies: Sarcophagoidea, Tachinoidea, and Oestroidea, as detailed in figures A37 through A39. These descriptions highlight his meticulous approach to analyzing structural characteristics, which are essential for distinguishing between closely related taxa. His work across these areas demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of both general fly taxonomy and specialized subgenera classifications, as well as the importance of morphological markers in entomological studies. Van Emden’s publications and illustrations remain key references for researchers examining the evolutionary relationships and diagnostic traits of these insect groups.\",5\n303,TACHINOIDEA,\"\n\nTACHINOIDEA is a superfamily of flies within the order Muscomorpha, characterized by the presence of a distinct postscutellum, a morphological feature that aids in their taxonomic classification. The larvae of Tachinoidea are parasitic, a defining trait of the group, and they are primarily associated with arthropod hosts, particularly insects. This superfamily is referenced in figures A37-A39 and A44, which illustrate key anatomical and ecological aspects of its members. The description draws from the works of van Emden (1954) and Shima et Chao (1988), who have contributed to the understanding of Tachinoidea’s morphology and life history. As part of the larger infraorder Muscomorpha, Tachinoidea represents a specialized lineage of flies adapted to parasitic lifestyles, with their adult forms often exhibiting traits that support their larval parasitism, such as specific oviposition behaviors or host-seeking adaptations. The combination of the postscutellum and parasitic development underscores the evolutionary distinctiveness of this group within the Diptera order. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the superfamily’s classification, parasitic larval stage, and morphological features.\",2\n326,OESTROIDEA,\"Oestroidea is a superfamily of flies with a developed postscutellum and parasitic larvae in hooved mammals, referenced in figures A37-A39 and A44 (仿van Emden, 1954; 仿Grunin, 1957)\",1\n1851,VERH.
