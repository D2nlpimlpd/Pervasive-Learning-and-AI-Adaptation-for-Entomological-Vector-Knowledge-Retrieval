It is composed of two main islands, Savai’i and Upolu, along with several smaller islands. The country is known for its tropical climate, volcanic landscapes, and rich cultural heritage rooted in Polynesian traditions. SAMOA is recognized as a sovereign state with a distinct political and social structure, governed by a constitutional parliamentary democracy.

All descriptions concur that the species is present in SAMOA, emphasizing its role as a habitat for this particular fly. The summary resolves the geographical discrepancy by aligning with widely accepted classifications of SAMOA as a Polynesian island nation in the South Pacific, rather than the Malay Archipelago.
