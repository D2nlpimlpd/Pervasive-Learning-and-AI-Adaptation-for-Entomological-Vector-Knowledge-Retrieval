He described numerous species across multiple genera and families, often serving as the original author for key taxa. In 1775, Fabricius first described the type species *Stomoxys siberita* and the Golden Tortoise Long-snouted Tachinid Fly (*金龟长喙寄蝇*). By 1781, he contributed to the establishment of the genus *Polietes* by designating *Musca lardaria* as its type species, while also describing *Musca corvina*.  \n\nIn 1794, Fabricius was particularly active, authoring descriptions for several species, including *Cuphocera varia*, *Musca merdaria* (later suppressed and reclassified under *Scathophaga*), *Musca ruficornis* (now *Parasarcophaga ruficornis*), *Peteina erinaceus*, *Ravinia striata*, *Sarcophila alba*, and *Musca cinerea*. This year also marked his work on the type species *Musca rudis* for the genus *Ravinia* and the genus *Scathophaga*, which incorporated the reclassified *Musca merdaria*. His 1805 contributions included *Siphona cristata*, *Hydrotaea dentipes*, and *Stomorhina lunata*, as well as *Helina quadrum*, the latter published in *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica*.  \n\nFabricius’s legacy extends to subspecies classification, such as *Myospila meditabunda meditabunda* (1871), and his work is frequently cited in synonymy, including *Neomyia indica*. Notably, some of his original descriptions were later revised, reflecting the evolving understanding of taxonomic relationships. For example, *Musca merdaria* was moved to *Scathophaga*, and *Musca ruficornis* became *Parasarcophaga ruficornis*. His 1868 description of *Sarcophila alba* further demonstrates his long-standing impact on entomological nomenclature.  \n\nFabricius’s work remains foundational in dipterology, with his species often serving as reference points in modern classifications. His descriptions spanned diverse ecological niches, from scavenging flies like *Musca lardaria* to parasitic tachinids such as *Musca rudis*. The inclusion of Chinese names, such as *四点阳蝇*, highlights the global reach of his taxonomic efforts. Despite some reclassifications and suppressions, his role as a pioneering taxonomist is undeniable, with his 1794 and 1805 works being particularly influential. Fabricius’s meticulous documentation and early adoption of systematic classification principles solidified his reputation as a key figure in the field.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",23\n5381,SIPHONA CRISTATA,,11\n2637,MYOSPIRA MEDITABUNDA MEDITABUNDA,\"A subspecies of Myospila meditabunda described by Fabricius, distributed in China (Taiwan, Guangdong) and parts of Southeast Asia.\",5\n3116,四点阳蝇,\"四点阳蝇 is a species of fly described by Fabricius, with a distribution in China and Europe\",2\n2204,MUSCA CORVINA FABRICIUS,\"A species of fly described by Fabricius in 1781, part of the Musca genus with specific morphological traits\",1\n3964,\"MUSCA RUDIS FABRICIUS, 1794\",,1\n4214,STOMORHINA DISCOLOR,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4097,FABRICIUS,NEOMYIA INDICA,Fabricius is referenced in the synonymy of the Indian greenbottle fly,38\n10319,FABRICIUS,SIPHONA CRISTATA,Fabricius described the species Siphona cristata in 1805,34\n4643,MYOSPIRA MEDITABUNDA MEDITABUNDA,FABRICIUS,Fabricius described this subspecies,28\n5572,四点阳蝇,FABRICIUS,Fabricius is the author who described the species 四点阳蝇,25\n3702,MUSCA CORVINA FABRICIUS,FABRICIUS,Fabricius described the species Musca corvina in 1781,24\n7448,FABRICIUS,\"MUSCA RUDIS FABRICIUS, 1794\",Fabricius is the author of the species Musca rudis,24\n7933,FABRICIUS,STOMORHINA DISCOLOR,Fabricius (1794) originally described the species Stomorhina discolor,24\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
