It hosts a wide array of flies, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Frontina laeta*, *Helina calceataeformis* (specifically in Zhaowuda League, Chifeng), *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Muscina stabulans*, *Muscina angustifrons*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Sarcophaga variegata*, *Zenillia dolosa*, and *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *albiceps*. The region is also home to *Tachina albidopilosa* and *Tachina nupta*, as well as *Peteina erinaceus* and the Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly (*Lucilia illustris*). \n\nInner Mongolia’s fly fauna includes representatives of the genera *Adia*, *Oestromyia*, *Strobilomyia* (with species like *Strobilomyia melaniola* and *Strobilomyia laricicola* in Ganhe and Guxuan), *Fannia* (*Fannia subscalaris* and *Fannia scalaris*), *Meigenia* (*Meigenia grandigena* in Dongwuqi), and *Hydrophoria* (e.g., *Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*). Specific species documented in the region include *Calliphora axata* (Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner, Hohhot), *Calliphora genarum* (southeastern Naoxintai), *Calliphora nigribarbis*, *Chionomyia vetula* (Hohhot), *Cynomya mortuorum*, *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, *Delia bisetosa*, *Delia sphaerobasis* (Ejina Banner, Lanzhou Medical College), *Haematobia titillans*, *Jingning* and *Tumertei* as locations for multiple species, and *Miltogrammoides zimini* alongside *Miltogramma bimaculatum* and *Miltogramma tibitum*. \n\nThe region is notable for its association with the *Phaonia* genus, including *Phaonia jagedaqiensis*, *Phaonia malaisei*, *Phaonia changbaishanensis*, and *Phaonia beizhenesis* (found in Guyuan). It also supports *Muscina assimilis* (Yitulihé, Tuluihé, Genhé), *Muscina sorbens*, *Muscina tempestiva*, and *Muscina atrifimbriaeformis*. Other documented species include *1238黑条蝇* (Black-striped Fly), *细角细麻蝇* (Slender-horned Small Fly), *1254钝叶污蝇* (Blunt-leaf Filth Fly), *1256黑须污蝇* (Black-bearded Filth Fly), *731 BINGLU FLY*, *Azelia fengi*, *Blaesoxipha litoralis* and *Blaesoxipha unicolor* (Keshiketeng Banner), *Brontaea* species, *Cuphocera varia*, *Dasyphora trichosterna*, *Dasyphora asiatica*, *Dasyphora albofasciata*, *Exorista larvarum*, *Gonia bimaculata*, *Kramerea schuetzei*, *Mydaea setifemur* and *Mydaea sinensis*, *Paraprosalpia recta*, *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae*, *Phormia regina* (Hohhot), *Protocalliphora lii*, *Senotainia deserta*, *Servaisia rossica*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, *Subhylemyia lineola*, and *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus*. \n\nInner Mongolia is the type locality for *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* (Alashan, Wuchuan Banner) and *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (Hohhot, Beijing). It is also linked to the Brush Spring Fly (*Anthomyia illocata*), *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (Plough Subfamily Fly), *1281毛股折麻蝇* (Hairy-thighed Folded Fly), and *1341细角细麻蝇* (Slender-horned Small Fly). The region’s ecological significance is further highlighted by studies on fly-host relationships and historical relocations of sericulturists during outbreaks of *柞蚕饰腹寄蝇* (Silkworm Decorated Abdomen Fly). \n\nKey locations within Inner Mongolia for fly distribution include Hohhot (Dagao Mountain, Naoxintai), Hulunbeier League, Alashan Banner, Abaga Banner, Shandianba, and the western Gobi Desert. The region’s biodiversity is underscored by the presence of multiple *Senotainia* species, *Sphixapata* subgenus, and genera like *Zaira*, *Protomiltogramma*, and *Prosena*. Notably, *KENT’S SARCOPHAGA* and *SHUANG YANGYING* are also recorded there. \n\nThis summary consolidates Inner Mongolia’s role as a critical hub for fly species in China, emphasizing its ecological and taxonomic diversity. All contradictions in the original data (e.g., references to \"\"province\"\" instead of \"\"autonomous region\"\") have been resolved to reflect its official status. The region’s inclusion of both common and rare species, along with specific localities, provides a comprehensive overview of its entomological importance.

It serves as a distribution site for several species within the genus *Helina*, including *Helina parcepilosa*, *Helina calceataeformis*, and *Helina obscuratoides*. Additionally, the species *Halina moedlingensis* is noted as being distributed in Poland, though this may represent a typographical variation of *Helina* (a genus in the family Muscidae) and requires further clarification. The country also hosts *Coenosia octopunctata* and *Coenosia flavicornis*, both members of the *Coenosia* genus, as well as *Haematobia titillans* (the horn fly) and *Musca larvipara* (a species of housefly). *Pollenia pectinata*, a blow fly, is similarly reported in Poland. The genus *Sinonipponia*, though less commonly referenced, is also documented as occurring in the region. Furthermore, the genus *Helicophagella* is described as being distributed in Poland, though the term \"\"foreign country\"\" in this context may be an error, as all other descriptions explicitly reference Poland as the location. Finally, the data highlights that Poland is a country where at least one species exhibits international distribution, though the specific species is not named. These findings underscore Poland’s ecological significance as a habitat for both native and internationally distributed insect taxa, contributing to broader biodiversity studies in Europe. The summary consolidates all provided information, resolving potential typographical inconsistencies (e.g., \"\"Halina\"\" likely intended as *Helina*) and emphasizing the country’s role in the geographic range of these species.
