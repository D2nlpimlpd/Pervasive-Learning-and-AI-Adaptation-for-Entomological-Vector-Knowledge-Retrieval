The province serves as a key habitat for multiple genera and species, including *Aplomyia*, *Bothria*, and *Zenillia*, as well as *Dichaetomyia bibax*, a blowfly species with multiple localities in the area. Notably, Liaoning is home to the endemic *Lucilia shenyangensis* and hosts species such as 长叶绿蝇 (*Lucilia longifolia*) and 太原绿蝇 (*Lucilia taiyuanensis*), both green blowflies. The genus *Protocalliphora*, represented by *P. azurea*, *P. chrysorrhoea*, and *P. maruyamensis*, is also documented here, alongside *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) kobayashii* and *Parasarcophaga (Jantia) crassipalpis*, with the latter having its type locality in Benxi. Additionally, *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) dux* is part of the province’s fauna.  \n\nLiaoning supports a range of other notable species, including *Servaisia* species, *Rypellia sinensis* (with its type locality at Daheishan), *Atherigona yiwulushan*, *Exorista rossica*, *Helina fica*, and *Phallocheira minor*. The province is also a documented location for *Phaonia maculobambusa* and *Phaonia brunneipalpis*, as well as *Sinohylemya craspedodonta* and *Phorbia fascicularis*. Among the tachinid flies, 1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇 (*Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) fasciata*) and 1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇 (*Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) abdominalis*) are found here, along with *三齿泉种蝇* (*Parasyrphus tridentis*). The blue-green fly 蓝翠蝇 (*Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis*) is distributed in localities such as Fushun, Beizhen, and Jin County, while the silver-fronted flesh fly 银额阳蝇 (*Sarcophaga argentifrons*) and the fine-bristled flesh fly group (细鬃棘蝇群) are also present.  \n\nThe region is further characterized by the presence of *Blaesoxipha* species, *巨尾阿丽蝇* (giant-tailed *A丽蝇*), and *叉丽蝇* (forked *丽蝇*). It is a distribution site for the Chrysomya genus (斑麻蝇属), including the long-bristled flesh fly 长白山点池蝇 (*Chrysomya yiwulushan*), and the red-legged patterned fly 绯胫纹蝇 (*Exorista rubitibia*). Specific localities like Daheishan and Benxi are highlighted as type localities for certain species, underscoring Liaoning’s role in entomological research.  \n\nIn total, Liaoning Province exhibits a rich and varied insect biodiversity, with documented occurrences of over 20 distinct species and genera, including both native and potentially introduced taxa. Its ecological significance is further reinforced by the presence of multiple species described or studied within its borders, making it a critical area for understanding dipteran distribution in China. The province’s role as a hub for such species highlights its importance in regional and global entomological studies.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",42\n4852,抚顺,中国辽宁省的地点，斑麻蝇属的分布地之一。,1\n4853,铁岭,中国辽宁省的地点，斑麻蝇属的分布地之一。,1\n4854,黑山,中国辽宁省的地点，斑麻蝇属的分布地之一。,1\n4855,营口,中国辽宁省的地点，斑麻蝇属的分布地之一。,1\n4754,蜢折麻蝇亚属,\"Grasshopper Servaisia subgenus, a subgenus of Servaisia with distinct features in male and female anatomy\",1\n4756,虎齿折麻蝇SERVAISIA MIXTA,\"A species in the Servaisia genus described by Rohdendorf in 1928, characterized by a hooked anal caudal lobe and specific wing venation patterns\",5\n4758,\"PUBL.
