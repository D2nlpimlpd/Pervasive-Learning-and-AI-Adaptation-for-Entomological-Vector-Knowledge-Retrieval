(499 words)\",180\n1444,XINYUAN,\"\n\nXINYUAN is a county located in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China, recognized as a significant geographical and ecological site in entomological studies. It is associated with the distribution and habitat of several notable insect species, including *Mesembrina intermedia*, *Pollenia sytshevskajae*, *Blaesoxipha gladiatrix*, *Onesiomima pamirica*, and *Heteronychia heptapotamica*. Additionally, Xinyuan serves as the **type locality** for *Pegomya crinilamella*, meaning it is the specific location where this species was first identified and described. The region’s biodiversity is further highlighted by its role as a sublocation in Xinjiang where *Heteronychia heptapotamica* is documented. While the descriptions emphasize Xinyuan’s connection to these species, they collectively underscore its importance as a hub for studying dipteran (true fly) and other insect populations in the broader Xinjiang area. The repeated references to Xinjiang as the overarching region align with the data, and no contradictions exist in the entity’s identification as a county or its ecological associations. This synthesis integrates all provided information into a cohesive overview of Xinyuan’s entomological significance.\",4\n963,CHANGJI,\"\n\nChangji is a city located in Xinjiang province, China, and serves as a geographical reference point for the distribution and association of specific species. The city is noted for being a habitat of *Delia floricola*, a species documented as present in the region. Additionally, Changji is linked to *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, another organism associated with the area. Both entities highlight the ecological or biological significance of Changji in the context of Xinjiang's biodiversity, though the descriptions focus on distinct species. The city’s role as a location in Xinjiang is consistent across the provided data, with no direct contradictions in the information. This summary consolidates the key details from the descriptions, emphasizing Changji’s connection to these two species while maintaining clarity and coherence.\",2\n753,KANAS LAKE,\"\n\nKanas Lake is a scenic and ecologically significant body of water located in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. It is recognized as a habitat for the species *Delia penicillosa*, a fly belonging to the family Anthomyiidae, which is also known in Chinese as 黑尾缘花蝇 (translating to \"\"Black-tailed Margin Fly\"\"). The lake's unique environment in Xinjiang supports the distribution of this species, highlighting its role in regional biodiversity. As a high-altitude lake in the Tianshan Mountains, Kanas Lake is part of a protected area renowned for its pristine natural landscapes and diverse ecosystems, which likely contribute to the presence of specialized fauna such as *Delia penicillosa*. The mention of both the scientific and Chinese names in the descriptions confirms that these refer to the same species, resolving any potential ambiguity.
