It is recognized as the **type locality** for *Meliniella sikisima*, a species first described and documented from this specific location, underscoring its importance in scientific classification. Additionally, the farm is noted as a **distribution site** for *Acrostilpna montana*, another species found in the region. These associations highlight Xinbin Gangshan Forest Farm’s role in biodiversity research and conservation, particularly for species native to or dependent on the local forest ecosystems. The farm’s environment likely supports the habitats required for both species, contributing to their presence and study in the area. While the descriptions emphasize distinct taxonomic roles for the two species, they collectively affirm the farm’s ecological relevance in Liaoning. Its designation as a type locality for *Meliniella sikisima* and as a distribution point for *Acrostilpna montana* positions it as a key reference for entomological and botanical studies in the region. The farm’s natural setting, possibly characterized by temperate forests or specific microhabitats, may provide critical conditions for these species’ survival and proliferation. This dual significance—serving as both a foundational site for species identification and a habitat for existing populations—underscores the importance of preserving and studying Xinbin Gangshan Forest Farm to advance understanding of local biodiversity. The information from both descriptions aligns to present a cohesive picture of the farm’s scientific value, with no contradictions to resolve.
