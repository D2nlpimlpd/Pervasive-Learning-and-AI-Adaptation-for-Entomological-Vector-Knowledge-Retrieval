It has conducted extensive surveys for **Hydrophoria species**, including a specific focus on **Hydrophoria melaena**, contributing to the study of these flies in the region. Simultaneously, the station serves as a critical repository for **type specimens** of the **Phaonia** genus, a group of flies significant to taxonomic and ecological research.  \n\nThe station preserves **holotype specimens** of several Phaonia species, such as **Phaonia angustiprosternum**, **Phaonia benxiensis**, **Phaonia yaluensis**, **Phaonia changbaishanensis**, and **Phaonia mimoaureola**, as well as the **type specimen of Phaonia ganshuensis**. A holotype is the single physical example designated as the official representative of a species, while type specimens collectively refer to the reference samples used to describe and classify new species. The station’s collection includes both roles, underscoring its importance in maintaining taxonomic standards for Phaonia.  \n\nNotably, the station is associated with researchers **MA, FANG, and CUI**, who have described Phaonia species preserved there. These species, including **Phaonia angustiprosternum** and **Phaonia benxiensis**, are linked to the station’s institutional responsibility for their type specimens. The diversity of preserved species reflects the station’s involvement in documenting regional biodiversity, particularly in areas like the Yalu River (Phaonia yaluensis) and Changbai Mountain (Phaonia changbaishanensis).  \n\nThe entity’s activities highlight its dual contributions to public health and scientific research. While its primary mandate likely involves health and epidemic prevention, its role in entomology extends to supporting studies on fly species, which may have implications for disease transmission, ecological monitoring, or environmental health. The preservation of these specimens ensures a reference for future taxonomic work and validates the region’s entomological records.  \n\nIn summary, the **Liaoning Provincial Health and Epidemic Prevention Station** is both a field research organization conducting surveys on Hydrophoria species and a custodian of type and holotype specimens for multiple Phaonia species, including those described by MA, FANG, and CUI.
