The data provided presents two conflicting accounts regarding its type locality. The first description states that the type locality is in **Liaoning (Benxi Nandian)** and **Shanxi (Yuanqu)**, while the second specifies **Gongga Mountain, Sichuan**, and notes the description was published in **1992**. These discrepancies suggest potential confusion in the original records or possible revisions to the species' taxonomic history.  \n\nTo resolve the contradiction, the 1992 publication by Fang and Fan is likely the authoritative source, as it includes a specific year and a distinct geographic location (Gongga Mountain, Sichuan). The mention of Liaoning and Shanxi in the first description may reflect either additional collection sites for the species or an error in associating those regions with the type locality. Given the lack of further context, the most coherent summary is that **Phanioa lucidula** was formally described by Fang and Fan in 1992, with its type locality established at **Gongga Mountain, Sichuan Province**. However, the species may also be documented in **Liaoning (Benxi Nandian)** and **Shanxi (Yuanqu)**, as these regions are listed in the first description, though their relevance to the type locality remains unclear.  \n\nThe species is part of the genus *Phanioa*, which belongs to the family of flies. Its classification and distribution are tied to the work of Fang and Fan, who have contributed to entomological research in China. The conflicting localities highlight the importance of cross-referencing taxonomic records to ensure accuracy, particularly when multiple sources or revisions exist. Further verification of the original 1992 publication or subsequent studies would clarify whether the type locality is exclusively in Sichuan or if the species has a broader geographic range encompassing Liaoning and Shanxi.  \n\nIn summary, **Phanioa lucidula** is a fly species described by Fang and Fan, with the most precise historical record pointing to **Gongga Mountain, Sichuan** as its type locality. Additional references to **Liaoning (Benxi Nandian)** and **Shanxi (Yuanqu)** may indicate later observations or misattributions, underscoring the need for taxonomic review to reconcile these differences. The species remains a subject of interest for entomologists studying regional biodiversity and historical biogeography in China.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",8\n3435,PHANOIA STENOPARAFACIA,\"A species of fly described by Fang and Fan, with type locality in Sichuan (Gongga Mountain)\",4\n3442,YUANQU,\"\n\nYUANQU is a city located in the Shanxi Province of China. It is recognized as a geographical site associated with two distinct species of the genus *Phaonia*: *Phaonia lucidula* and *Phaonia longifurca*. The presence of *Phaonia lucidula* in Yuanqu highlights its role as a habitat for this species, while *Phaonia longifurca* is also specifically linked to the city, indicating that both species may coexist in the region or have been documented there in separate studies. As a location in Shanxi, Yuanqu is situated within a broader ecological and administrative context, contributing to the biodiversity and entomological significance of the province. The descriptions provided collectively establish Yuanqu as a notable site for these *Phaonia* species, though the exact ecological relationships or distribution patterns between the two species in the area remain unspecified. The city’s association with these species underscores its relevance in regional biological research and conservation efforts.\",2\n3440,GONGGA MOUNTAIN,\"\n\nGONGGA MOUNTAIN, located in Sichuan province, China, is a significant geographical site recognized as the type locality for two species within the genus *Phaonia*: *Phaonia lucidula* and *Phaonia stenoparafacia*. As a type locality, it serves as the reference point for the original description and classification of these species, which are likely flies belonging to the family Muscidae or a related group, given the genus *Phaonia* is commonly associated with such taxa. The mountain’s ecological and geographical characteristics, including its elevation and biodiversity, may contribute to the presence of these species, though specific details about their habitats or behaviors are not provided in the descriptions. Both species are tied to Sichuan province, highlighting the region’s role in entomological research and its importance as a biodiversity hotspot. The mention of GONGGA MOUNTAIN as the type locality for these two *Phaonia* species underscores its value in taxonomic studies, where it provides a foundational context for understanding their distribution and evolutionary history. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as both consistently identify the mountain as the type locality for distinct *Phaonia* species within the same province.
