The journal has served as a platform for entomologists to document new species and their initial taxonomic placements. Among the species associated with this publication are *Pegoplata virginea*, which was first described in 1826 under the genus *Anthomyia*; *Botanophila varicolor*, referenced in the journal; *Pegohylemyia fugax*, described within its pages; *Pseudonupedia intersecta*, detailed in SYST.BESCHR. with its original classification also under *Anthomyia*; and *Hylemya partita*, another species formally described in the same publication. These entries highlight the journal’s role in early 19th-century entomology, particularly in the systematic study of flies, where species were often reclassified over time as taxonomic understanding evolved. For instance, *Pegoplata virginea* and *Pseudonupedia intersecta* were initially placed in *Anthomyia*, a genus that has since been revised, with these species moved to their current genera. The journal’s contributions to dipteran taxonomy are notable for establishing foundational records, even as subsequent research has refined their classifications. SYST.BESCHR. remains a key historical source for understanding the nomenclatural history and phylogenetic relationships of these species. Its descriptions provide critical baseline data for modern taxonomists to trace the evolution of scientific naming conventions and ecological insights into these fly species. The publication’s focus on systematic biology underscores its importance in the broader context of biodiversity documentation during its active period. While specific dates for all species are not provided, the 1826 reference for *Pegoplata virginea* situates SYST.BESCHR. as a 19th-century resource, aligning with the era’s emphasis on formalizing biological classifications. The inclusion of multiple species across different genera (e.g., *Pegohylemyia*, *Pseudonupedia*, *Hylemya*) suggests the journal covered a range of dipteran families, contributing to the taxonomic framework of the time. Overall, SYST.BESCHR. exemplifies the iterative nature of scientific classification, where initial groupings are later adjusted based on new evidence, and its records remain valuable for both historical and contemporary entomological research.\",6\n1728,厩腐蝇,\"A species of fly, Muscina(s.str.) stabulans (Fallen, 1823), widely distributed in China and globally.

Additionally, Tahe is home to *Delia penicillaris*, another species documented within its geographical boundaries, further underscoring the area's biodiversity. Beyond these, the county is also significant in entomological research as the location where the holotype of *Spilogona costalis* was collected. A holotype serves as the single physical example used to formally describe and name a species, indicating that Tahe has contributed to the scientific classification of this particular fly species. While the descriptions emphasize different biological associations, they collectively affirm Tahe's status as a key ecological and taxonomic site in Heilongjiang province, with a focus on its role in the distribution and study of these specific organisms.

This species is distinguished by its unique morphological features, which align with the broader taxonomic classification of the Lispe genus within the family Syrphidae (hoverflies). As a member of this genus, LISPE TENTACULATA shares characteristics typical of Lispe species, such as a robust body structure and specific wing patterns, while also exhibiting traits that set it apart for identification. The description by DeGeer established its scientific recognition, contributing to the study of dipteran biodiversity. Its name, derived from Latin, may reflect notable physical attributes, though further details on its ecology, behavior, or geographic distribution are not provided in the given data. The species remains a subject of interest in entomological research for its role in understanding evolutionary adaptations within the Syrphidae family.\",12\n382,XINJIANG,\"\n\nXinjiang, officially the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is a geographically and ecologically diverse region in northwestern China, renowned for its rich biodiversity of fly species and other arthropods. It serves as a critical domestic distribution area for numerous insect genera and species, including both common and specialized taxa. The region hosts a wide array of flies, such as the genera *Calliphora* (e.g., *Calliphora tianshanica* in Manshan at 2400m altitude), *Sarcophaga* (e.g., *Sarcophaga variegata*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, *Sarcophaga aegyptica*), *Delia* (e.g., *Delia sphaerobasis*, *Delia radicum*, *Delia hirtitibia*), *Pegohylemyia* (e.g., *Pegohylemyia alatavensis*, *Pegohylemyia fugax*, *Pegohylemyia betarum*), and *Tachina* (e.g., *Tachina albidopilosa*, *Tachina nupta*). Specific species documented in Xinjiang include *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Drymeia xinjiangensis*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Parasarcophaga pleskei*, *Parasarcophaga emdeni*, *Elodia* species, *Hydrophoria* species (e.g., *Hydrophoria melaena*), *Miltogramma bimaculatum*, *Leucophora cinerea*, *Leucophora sociata*, and *Hydrotaea armipes*. Notable localities within Xinjiang include Urumqi, Altay, Akesu, Kanas Lake, Yili River basin, and high-altitude sites like Bayi Akesu (2400m) and Manas. \n\nThe region is also home to rare or regionally significant species, such as *Eumetopiella (Intermedia) luridimacula* (type locality at Bayi Akesu), *Pierretia (s.str.) villeneuvei* and *Pierretia (s.str.) recurvata*, and *PIERRETTIA CLATHRATA*. Unique species like *1280钩阳折麻蝇* (Hook Yang Zhe Ma Fly) and *1281毛股折麻蝇* (Mao Gu Zhe Ma Fly) are documented in Habahe Baihaba, while *华丽聚蜂麻蝇* (Beautiful Cluster Bee Fly) is found in Bayi and Aksu. Other notable distributions include *Adia* genus, *Thecocarceilia* genus, *Chirosia orthostylata*, *Blondelia nigripes*, *Exorista fasciata*, *Exorista larvarum*, and *Robineauella (D.) anchoriformis*. \n\nXinjiang’s ecological diversity supports multiple species of medical or agricultural importance, such as *Haematobia titillans* and *Haematobia irritans* (horse flies), *Muscina assimilis* (distributed in Urumqi, Altay, and other areas), and *Musca domestica* (housefly). The region is also a key habitat for *Parasarcophaga aegyptica* and *Parasarcophaga emdeni*, as well as *Pegomya* species like *Pegomya cunicularia* and *Pegomya esuriens*. Additionally, *Nupedia aestiva*, *Nupedia patellans*, and *Nupedia infirma* are reported in Xinjiang, alongside *Wohlfahrtia stackelbergi* and *Wohlfahrtia* species in Suiding, Wusu, and Qume. \n\nXinjiang’s role in entomological studies is further highlighted by its association with the Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing, underscoring its significance in domestic research. The region’s varied ecosystems, from the Tianshan Mountains to the Yili River basin, contribute to the presence of species like *Aleximyia*, *Servaisia rossica*, *Voria ruralis*, and *Pygophora longicornis*. Specific localities such as Hamu, East Tianshan, and Bole are noted for *Caricea vernalis* and *Heteronychia* species. \n\nIn summary, Xinjiang is a vital hub for the distribution of diverse fly species and related arthropods, with its unique geography and climate fostering a wide range of taxa. Key areas like Urumqi, Altay, and Kanas Lake, along with high-altitude and riverine habitats, support both common and regionally endemic species, making it a focal point for ecological and parasitological research in China.\",180\n4876,HELICOPHAGELLA MELANURA,\"A species of fly described by Meigen in 1826, found in regions such as Xinjiang, Central Asia, and the Soviet Union.

Additionally, Xinyuan serves as the **type locality** for *Pegomya crinilamella*, meaning it is the specific location where this species was first identified and described. The region’s biodiversity is further highlighted by its role as a sublocation in Xinjiang where *Heteronychia heptapotamica* is documented. While the descriptions emphasize Xinyuan’s connection to these species, they collectively underscore its importance as a hub for studying dipteran (true fly) and other insect populations in the broader Xinjiang area. The repeated references to Xinjiang as the overarching region align with the data, and no contradictions exist in the entity’s identification as a county or its ecological associations.
