Distributed in China's Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Beijing, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Fujian, Taiwan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hainan, as well as the Soviet Union, Korea, Japan, and the USA. Body length 9.0 mm.>\",12\n988,朝鲜,\"\n\n**Summary of \"\"朝鲜\"\" (North Korea):**  \nNorth Korea (朝鲜) is a country recognized as a significant distribution location for a diverse range of insect species, including both native and internationally documented taxa. Among the species associated with its territory are **Lucilia shenyangensis**, a blow fly species, and **Tricycleopsis paradoxa**, a parasitic fly. The **Protocalliphora azurea** is specifically noted to inhabit the Neoyan Mountain region within North Korea. Additionally, the country hosts **Parasarcophaga (Jantia) crassipalpis** and **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) dux**, two species of sarcophagid flies, as well as **Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa**, which is described as having a foreign distribution in North Korea.  \n\nThe **大洋翠蝇 Neomyia (Orthellia) laevifrons** is another species documented in North Korea, with specific records from locations such as Juyi and Fuzhan. Chinese-named species like **赴战客夜蝇** (likely a local designation for a nocturnal fly) and **巨尾阿丽蝇** (a large-tailed丽蝇, or *Chrysomya* species) are also part of the country’s entomological profile, alongside **叉丽蝇** (a *Chrysomya* species with a forked tail). Notably, **Delia floralis**, a species of flower fly, is described as having North Korea as a \"\"foreign distribution location,\"\" suggesting its presence there may be influenced by external factors or limited to specific regions.  \n\nThe term **Ph,aureola Shin. et Kano** (likely referring to *Phaenicia aureola*, a blow fly species) is explicitly listed as being distributed in North Korea, though the context of its classification or habitat remains unspecified. The country’s role in the global distribution of these species is further emphasized by descriptions labeling it as a site where \"\"species are found internationally,\"\" indicating potential ecological or migratory connections beyond its borders.  \n\nWhile some descriptions use the term \"\"Korea\"\" generically, the focus on \"\"朝鲜\"\" clarifies that these references pertain specifically to North Korea. The presence of multiple genera and species, including *Lucilia*, *Parasarcophaga*, *Neomyia*, and *Chrysomya*, highlights the country’s biodiversity in the Diptera order (flies). Specific geographic mentions, such as Neoyan Mountain and Juyi/Fuzhan, underscore localized habitats within North Korea that support these species.  \n\nIn summary, North Korea (朝鲜) serves as a key region for the distribution of various insect species, including both commonly recognized and regionally specific taxa. Its ecosystems, particularly in mountainous and coastal areas, contribute to the presence of these species, though further research may be needed to resolve ambiguities in some classifications or distribution patterns. The country’s entomological significance is reinforced by its inclusion in international species records, reflecting its role in broader ecological networks.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",10\n3290,\"PH,AUREOLA SHIN.
