It is associated with two notable species: *Syngamoptera amurensis* and *Fannia prisca*. *Syngamoptera amurensis*, a species of fly, is specifically linked to the Amur River region, which may include Vladivostok’s surrounding ecosystems due to its proximity to the Russian Far East’s diverse habitats. Similarly, *Fannia prisca*, another fly species, is documented as being distributed in the city, reflecting its role as a biodiversity hotspot or research site for entomologists. The city’s ecological significance, likely tied to its coastal and temperate climate, supports the presence of these species, which are part of the broader fauna of the region. While the descriptions emphasize Vladivostok’s connection to these species, they do not clarify whether the city is a primary habitat, a research location, or a point of historical record for their distribution. The mention of the Soviet Union in the descriptions highlights the city’s historical context, though its current status as part of Russia is also relevant. Overall, Vladivostok is recognized as a geographical and ecological reference point for both *Syngamoptera amurensis* and *Fannia prisca*, underscoring its importance in scientific studies related to these organisms.
