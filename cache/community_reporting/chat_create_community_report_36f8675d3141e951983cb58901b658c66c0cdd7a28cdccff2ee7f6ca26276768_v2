He is recognized as the original describer of *Dichaetomyia nubiana* (formerly referred to as *NUBIANA DICHAETOMYIA*), which he classified in 1885. Additionally, Bigot established the genus *Strongyloneura* and described the species *Strongyloneura prasina* within it. In 1874, he authored the species *I. tripartita*, though the full genus name is not explicitly provided in the data. Earlier, in 1877, he described *Hypopygiopsis infumata*, further demonstrating his expertise in entomology and taxonomy. His work spans multiple taxonomic groups, including flies (Diptera) and potentially other arthropods, as evidenced by the diverse species he documented. Bigot’s legacy lies in his meticulous descriptions and classifications, which remain foundational in the study of these organisms. His contributions highlight his role in advancing 19th-century biological taxonomy through the formalization of species and genera.\",5\n4358,STRONGYLONEURA PRASINA,,11\n4353,MOKEDUO,Location in Tibet where Strongyloneura prasina is distributed,1\n4354,NEOYAN MOUNTAIN,Location in Korea where Strongyloneura prasina is distributed,1\n4355,JIRI MOUNTAIN,Location in Korea where Strongyloneura prasina is distributed,1\n4357,STRONGYLONEURA,,2\n3003,NUBIANA DICHAETOMYIA,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n8253,BIGOT,STRONGYLONEURA PRASINA,Bigot is the author of the species Strongyloneura prasina,16\n8266,MOKEDUO,STRONGYLONEURA PRASINA,Mokeduo is a specific location in Tibet for Strongyloneura prasina,12\n8268,NEOYAN MOUNTAIN,STRONGYLONEURA PRASINA,Neoyan Mountain in Korea is a distribution location for Strongyloneura prasina,12\n8269,JIRI MOUNTAIN,STRONGYLONEURA PRASINA,Jiri Mountain in Korea is a distribution location for Strongyloneura prasina,12\n8252,BIGOT,STRONGYLONEURA,Bigot is the author of the genus Strongyloneura,7\n5392,BIGOT,NUBIANA DICHAETOMYIA,BIGOT classified the NUBIANA DICHAETOMYIA species,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
