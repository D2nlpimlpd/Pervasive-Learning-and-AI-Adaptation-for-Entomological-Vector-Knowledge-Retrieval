Rohdendorf in 1962. The species is primarily associated with the geographical regions of Japan and the former Soviet Union, as noted in its original description. However, a secondary source indicates its presence in China, which may reflect either an expansion of its known range over time, a taxonomic revision, or a potential misattribution in the literature. The discrepancy between the Soviet Union and China as habitats could stem from historical geopolitical changes (e.g., the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991) or differing regional classifications. Despite this, both descriptions concur that *Goniophyto honshuensis* is native to Japan, establishing it as a key component of the local biodiversity in that region. Further research may be required to clarify its distribution in relation to the Soviet Union and China, particularly to determine whether the species persists in parts of the Russian Federation (formerly the Soviet Union) or has been documented in China under a different nomenclatural context. The species remains a subject of interest for entomologists studying dipteran taxonomy and biogeography in East Asia.\",3\n331,ROHDENDORF,\"\n\nROHDENDORF was a prominent Soviet taxonomist and entomologist active in the 1920s–1970s, renowned for his extensive contributions to the classification of flies, particularly within the Sarcophagidae family (flesh flies). His work spanned multiple genera and species, with a focus on morphological and taxonomic studies. Key contributions include the establishment of several genera, such as *Sinonipponia* (1959), *Iranihindia* (1961), *Kramerea*, *Pandelleana*, *Kozlovea*, *Phallosphaera* (1937), *Seniorwhitea* (1937), *Tephromyia*, *Locustaevora* (both in 1928), and *Asiometopia* (1935). He also described numerous species, including *Asiometopia persa* (1935), *Taxigramma heteroneurum* (1935), *Miltogrammoides zimini* (1935), *Miltogramma asiaticum* (1935), *Servaisia jakovlevi* (1937), *Servaisia subamericana* (1932), *Servaisia mixta* (1928), *Parasarcophaga kirgizica* (1969, type locality in Kyrgyzstan, former Soviet Union), *Parasarcophaga emdeni* (1969), *Phylloteles stackelbergi*, *Blaesoxipha arenicola* (1928), *Calliphora tianshanica* (1962), and *Turanogonia smirnovi* (1924). Additionally, he described the subgenus *Eutaxigramma* (1935) and reclassified *teretirostris*.  \n\nRohdendorf’s research extended to defining subgenera and reclassifying genera, such as *Pseudothyrsocnema* (1937), *Phallantha* (1938), and *Bellieriomima* (1937), which he later synonymized or reorganized. He authored significant works on Sarcophaginae and Phyllotelina subfamilies in 1935, 1971, and 1975, and his 1938 study on *Parasarcophaga unguitigris* remains a reference. Among his notable species descriptions are *Boettcherisca septentrionalis* (1937, 1965), *Metopia tshernovae* (1955), *Metopia campestris* (1971), and *Metopia stackelbergi* (1955). He also described *Sarcophaga sera* (1930), *Phallocheira minor* (1937), and *Sarcophaga semenovi* (1925, later reclassified as *Parasarcophaga (Ziminisca) semenovi*).  \n\nRohdendorf’s work included collaborations, such as co-describing *Sarcophila rasnitzyni* (1985) and *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* (1967) and *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) jacobsoni* (1971). He was associated with the genus *Goniophyto*, describing *Goniophyto honshuensis* in 1962 and contributing to its 1965 classification. His 1937 descriptions of *Heteronychia bajkalensis* and the genus *Sarcorohdendorfia* (球麻蝇属) further highlight his focus on regional biodiversity. Notably, he described *Triceratopyga calliphoroides* (叉丽蝇) in 1931 and *Onesiomima pamirica* and *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, with the latter’s type locality in Mongolia (1924).  \n\nRohdendorf’s legacy is marked by meticulous taxonomic work, including the establishment of subgenera like *Phallantha* (1938) and *Pseudothyrsocnema* (1937), and his role in defining the *Harpagophalla* genus (1937). His studies on species such as *KENT’S SARCOPHAGA* and *USURI SARCOPHAGA* (1937) and the 1938 description of the *1354 Tail Pierretia Fly* (Pierretia (s.str.) sororcula) underscore his influence in dipteran taxonomy. Despite some overlapping references to species like *Wohlfahrtia stackelbergi* and *Wohlfahrtia pavlovskyi* (1956), his work remains foundational in entomological literature, particularly for Sarcophagidae systematics.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",94\n280,SARCOPHAGIDAE,\"\n\n**SARCOPHAGIDAE** (also known as *Sarcophagidae* or 麻蝇科 in Chinese) is a family of flies characterized by distinct morphological and developmental traits. The family includes subfamilies such as **Ameniinae**, **Calliphorinae**, and **Sarcophaginae**, with the latter being particularly notable for its larval features. Members of *Sarcophagidae* are typically identified by their posterior spiracles, which exhibit unique structural adaptations, and specific wing venation patterns that distinguish them from other fly families. Additionally, the anal cerci (posterior appendages) of adult sarcophagids are often described as long and slender, a trait observed in many species within the family.  \n\nThe larvae of *Sarcophagidae* display key characteristics that aid in classification. For instance, larvae in the **Sarcophaginae** subfamily are marked by the presence of 12 or more short projections on the eighth abdominal segment, as noted in one description. Another description highlights that these larvae lack anal tubercles and possess incomplete sternal rings, further refining their morphological profile. These larval traits are critical for differentiating *Sarcophagidae* from related families like *Calliphoridae* (blow flies), which often have distinct developmental features.  \n\nThe family is also referenced in scientific literature, such as the journal *ΦayHa CCCP* (likely a typo or formatting issue, as this appears to be a Cyrillic title), which mentions the species *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) jaroschevskyi*. This example underscores the taxonomic diversity within *Sarcophagidae*, including genera like *Parasarcophaga* and *Liosarcophaga*. While the descriptions provided focus on different aspects—adult morphology, larval anatomy, and specific species—the family is consistently defined by its unique combination of traits, such as the absence of anal tubercles in larvae and the structural peculiarities of posterior spiracles and wing venation.  \n\nIn summary, *Sarcophagidae* is a well-defined family of flies with a complex taxonomy, encompassing subfamilies like **Ameniinae**, **Calliphorinae**, and **Sarcophaginae**. Its members are distinguished by adult features like long anal cerci and specific wing venation, as well as larval traits such as incomplete sternal rings, lack of anal tubercles, and multiple abdominal projections. The family’s inclusion in scientific studies, such as the documentation of *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) jaroschevskyi*, highlights its ecological and taxonomic significance. These characteristics collectively provide a framework for understanding the morphology, life cycle, and classification of sarcophagid flies.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",11\n4711,BLAESOXIPHA ARENICOLA,\"A species of fly described by Rohdendorf in 1928, with larvae parasitizing Locusta migratoria and other grasshoppers\",7\n5286,虎爪亚麻蝇,虎爪亚麻蝇（Parasarcophaga (s. str.) unguitigris）是1938年由ROHDENDORF描述的亚麻蝇物种，雄性后足胫节无长缨毛，体长5.5-8.0毫米，分布于中国吉林、辽宁及日本、朝鲜、苏联（锡霍特山模式产地）,7\n4438,ALEXIMYIA,\"\n\n**ALEXIMYIA** is a genus of flies belonging to the subfamily Sarcophaginae, first described by the entomologist Rohdendorf in 1930. This genus is characterized by distinct morphological features, including the presence of open or narrowly closed 2R5 cells in the wing venation, a trait that aids in its taxonomic identification. Additionally, members of *Aleximyia* are notable for their red-brown antennae, which contribute to their visual differentiation from closely related genera. \n\nThe distribution of *Aleximyia* is primarily documented in Central Asia, with specific records from the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China. These regions, historically part of the Soviet Union, highlight the genus's association with Central Asian ecosystems. While the first description emphasizes the genus's broader Central Asian range, the second clarifies its presence in both Kyrgyzstan and Xinjiang, aligning with the geopolitical context of the time. No direct contradictions exist between the two accounts; rather, they collectively reinforce the genus's geographic localization to these areas. \n\n*Aleximyia* is part of the Sarcophaginae subfamily, which includes flesh flies known for their diverse ecological roles, often as decomposers or parasitoids. The genus's defining traits, such as the wing venation pattern and antennal coloration, are critical for distinguishing it within this taxonomic group. Its historical description by Rohdendorf in 1930 situates it within early 20th-century entomological research, particularly in regions under Soviet influence. The inclusion of Xinjiang in China further underscores the genus's presence in transboundary ecosystems, though no additional species beyond the initial description have been explicitly noted in the provided data. \n\nIn summary, *Aleximyia* is a Sarcophaginae genus with a 1930 origin, marked by unique wing and antennal features, and a distribution centered in Central Asia, specifically in Kyrgyzstan and Xinjiang. Its taxonomic significance lies in these morphological characteristics and its historical entomological context.\",6\n5104,USURI SARCOPHAGA,\"A species of fly (Pierretia stackelbergi) described by Rohdendorf in 1937, with specific tail and abdominal features.

During this year, he first described the species *Blaesoxipha arenicola*, which is part of the Sarcophagidae family. Additionally, Rohdendorf documented *Chrysogramma variabile*, another member of the same family, alongside other Sarcophagidae species in his taxonomic work. These descriptions were pivotal in expanding the scientific understanding of flesh fly diversity and classification during the early 20th century. The year 1928 thus marks a key milestone in entomological research, as it reflects Rohdendorf’s role in formally identifying and categorizing multiple Sarcophagidae species, including *Blaesoxipha arenicola* and *Chrysogramma variabile*. His efforts in this period provided foundational insights for subsequent studies on the morphology, ecology, and evolutionary relationships of these insects. The concurrent documentation of these species underscores the productivity of his work in 1928, which likely involved detailed morphological analyses and comparisons to establish their distinct identities within the Sarcophagidae family. While the descriptions of *Blaesoxipha arenicola* and *Chrysogramma variabile* are highlighted as separate achievements, they are part of a broader taxonomic initiative by Rohdendorf to systematize knowledge of Sarcophagidae, a group known for its scavenging and parasitic behaviors.

Rohdendorf in 1931. This genus is characterized by distinct morphological features, particularly unique antennae and abdominal structures, which serve as key taxonomic markers for its identification. As a member of the Calliphoridae family, Triceratopyga is part of a group commonly known as blow flies or carrion flies, which are typically associated with decomposing organic matter and play significant ecological roles in nutrient cycling. The specific adaptations of its antennae and abdomen suggest specialized behaviors or ecological niches, though further details on its biology, distribution, or species diversity are not provided in the descriptions. The genus name \"\"Triceratopyga\"\" likely reflects these distinguishing traits, with \"\"tricerato-\"\" (three-horned) and \"\"-pyga\"\" (abdomen) hinting at the morphology emphasized in its classification. Rohdendorf’s original work in 1931 established the taxonomic framework for this genus, which remains a recognized entity in entomological studies.

It includes the species *Asiometopia persa* and is distinguished by grayish-white powder on the head and abdominal markings.,1\n4496,PERSIA,\"\n\n**PERSIA** is a historical region located in the Middle East, corresponding to the area now known as Iran. It has long been recognized as a significant geographical and cultural hub, with its historical boundaries encompassing parts of modern-day Iran and surrounding territories. The region is notable for its ecological diversity, which supports various species of flora and fauna. Two specific biological records highlight Persia's role in the distribution of particular organisms.  \n\nFirst, **Northern Persia** is documented as a habitat for *Asiometopia persa*, a species likely associated with the region's unique environmental conditions. This reference underscores the biodiversity of the northern parts of the historical Persian territory. Second, the broader region of **Persia** is identified as part of the distribution area for *Asilomorpha multipunctata* (translated from the Chinese name 多斑聚蜂麻蝇), a species of fly. This indicates that the entire historical expanse of Persia, including its central and southern regions, contributes to the ecological range of this insect.  \n\nWhile the descriptions focus on different species and specific sub-regions (Northern Persia vs. the entire historical area), they collectively emphasize Persia's importance as a biodiversity hotspot. The mention of *Asiometopia persa* in Northern Persia aligns with the region's mountainous and temperate ecosystems, whereas *Asilomorpha multipunctata*’s presence in Persia as a whole suggests adaptability to a wider range of habitats, including arid or semi-arid zones common in parts of the historical region.  \n\nThe use of \"\"Persia\"\" as a historical name for Iran is consistent across both descriptions, resolving any potential ambiguity. Together, these records illustrate the ecological significance of the region, linking its historical identity to contemporary biological studies. Persia’s varied landscapes, from the Alborz Mountains in the north to the Zagros Mountains and central plains, provide diverse niches for species like *Asiometopia persa* and *Asilomorpha multipunctata* to thrive.  \n\nIn summary, **PERSIA** (historically synonymous with Iran) is a Middle Eastern region with documented ecological relevance for two distinct species: *Asiometopia persa* in its northern reaches and *Asilomorpha multipunctata* across its broader territory. These findings reflect the region’s role in supporting specialized and widespread insect populations, contributing to global biodiversity records. The integration of historical and biological data highlights Persia’s enduring significance in both cultural and scientific contexts.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",1\n4526,REVUE D'ENTOMOLOGIE DE L'URSS,Revue d'Entomologie de l'URSS is a Soviet entomology journal where Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi and Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) jacobsoni were described in 1967 and 1971,1\n4537,本州沼野蝇GONIOPHYTO HONSHUENSIS ROHDENDORF,A species of fly (Goniophyto honshuensis Rohdendorf) referenced in the text.,1\n4617,SINAGRIA,A genus of flies described by Rohdendorf in 1965,1\n4792,PANDELLEANA,Pandelleana is a genus in the Sarcophagini tribe described by Rohdendorf in 1937,1\n4795,KOZLOVEA,,1\n4802,KRAMEREA,\"Kramerea is a genus of flies established by Rohdendorf in 1937, characterized by specific morphological features such as male anal tail leaves and side body structures\",1\n4801,SINONIPPONIA,\"\n\n**SINONIPPONIA** is a genus of flies within the Diptera order, distinguished by a combination of morphological traits that set it apart from other related genera. The genus is characterized by the absence of bristles on the **r1 vein**, a feature that is critical for taxonomic identification. Additionally, members of *Sinonipponia* exhibit **developed abdominal bristles**, which contribute to their unique external morphology.  \n\nA defining feature of the genus lies in the **male genitalia**, which display specialized structures. The phallic appendage is notably elongated, forming a **long phallic body** with a prominent **large central projection**. This projection is often accompanied by **paired lateral branches** or **paired membranous processes**, depending on the species and developmental stage. These paired structures are considered key diagnostic elements, as they are not commonly observed in closely related genera. The combination of a long phallus and these paired appendages is thought to play a role in reproductive behavior or species-specific mating mechanisms.  \n\nThe descriptions provided are largely complementary, with no direct contradictions. The first emphasizes the phallic body’s structure, while the second adds details about the r1 vein and abdominal bristles. Together, these traits form a cohesive profile: *Sinonipponia* flies are identified by their lack of r1 bristles, robust abdominal setae, and male genitalia featuring an extended phallus with a central projection and paired appendages. These characteristics are consistently used in entomological studies to classify and differentiate the genus within its taxonomic group.  \n\nThe genus is likely of interest to researchers studying dipteran evolution, as its morphological adaptations may reflect ecological or behavioral specializations. However, further studies on its life history, habitat preferences, and genetic relationships could enhance understanding of its role in the broader fly family. The integration of both descriptions ensures a comprehensive overview, highlighting the importance of both external and genitalia-based features in defining *Sinonipponia*.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",1\n4826,HARPAGOPHALLA,,1\n4827,PHALLOCHEIRA,,1\n4858,潘麻蝇属,潘麻蝇属 (Pandelleana) 是一个蝇类分类属，由Rohdendorf于1937年建立。其属征包括触角第三节为第二节的1.5-3/4倍长，雄性尾器结构特殊，阳茎膜状突呈香蕉形。,1\n4919,PYCCK.
