He authored multiple studies published in *Zoological Research* in 1980, with a primary focus on the biology and taxonomy of fly larvae. One notable work centered on *Hypopygiopsis infumata*, a species of fly, where he likely explored its developmental stages, ecological role, or taxonomic classification, as indicated by the specific study title. His research during this period also encompassed broader investigations into animal species, reflecting a commitment to advancing understanding of zoological diversity and life cycles. The 1980 publications in *Zoological Research* highlight his expertise in documenting and analyzing insect morphology and behavior, particularly in larval forms, which are critical for ecological and evolutionary studies. While the descriptions provided do not specify the exact findings of his work, they collectively establish GAN YUNXING as a 1980s scholar whose publications in this journal addressed both specialized and general topics within zoology, with a particular emphasis on fly larvae. His studies would have contributed to the scientific community’s knowledge of insect taxonomy, developmental biology, or ecological interactions during that era. The consistency across the descriptions—linking him to 1980, *Zoological Research*, and research on fly larvae and animal species—supports a unified narrative of his academic focus. No contradictions exist in the provided data, allowing for a coherent summary of his work as a 1980s researcher in zoology, specifically within the context of fly larvae and related species. His publications remain part of the historical record in entomological and zoological research, underscoring his role in documenting biodiversity during a pivotal time for taxonomic studies.\",2\n6180,ZOLOGICAL RESEARCH,\"\n\n**ZOLOGICAL RESEARCH** is a Chinese academic journal that has served as a platform for entomological studies, particularly those focusing on fly larvae and insect taxonomy. The journal has published collaborative research by Gao Jingming and Gan Yunxing on fly larvae, contributing to the understanding of their developmental biology, ecological significance, and potential applications in forensic science or environmental studies. Additionally, Gan Yunxing individually authored a 1980 study on *Hypopygiopsis infumata*, a species of fly, which further highlights the journal’s role in documenting detailed taxonomic and morphological analyses of insect species. These publications underscore **ZOLOGICAL RESEARCH** as a key outlet for scientific advancements in zoology, with a specific emphasis on entomological research in China. The journal’s focus on both general and species-specific studies reflects its commitment to fostering comprehensive insights into insect life cycles, biodiversity, and related ecological interactions. By featuring works from researchers like Gao Jingming and Gan Yunxing, **ZOLOGICAL RESEARCH** has established itself as a credible and specialized resource for zoological and entomological scholarship. Its contributions to the field include not only empirical findings but also foundational knowledge that supports broader scientific and practical applications, such as forensic entomology or conservation efforts. The combination of collaborative and individual research, along with the journal’s regional and thematic focus, positions it as a valuable repository for studies on insect biology and taxonomy, particularly in the context of Chinese ecosystems. The 1980 study on *Hypopygiopsis infumata* by Gan Yunxing exemplifies the journal’s long-standing engagement with taxonomic work, while the studies on fly larvae by both researchers demonstrate its relevance to contemporary zoological inquiries. Overall, **ZOLOGICAL RESEARCH** plays a pivotal role in advancing the study of zoological sciences, with a particular emphasis on entomology, through the dissemination of rigorous, peer-reviewed research.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11965,HEBEI,PUBLICATION BY GAN YUNXING IN 1980,The 1980 publication includes data on Hebei's larvae,101\n11956,GAN YUNXING,ZOLOGICAL RESEARCH,\"\n\n**GAN YUNXING** is a researcher associated with **ZOLOGICAL RESEARCH**, a journal focused on zoological studies. Gan Yunxing has contributed to the journal by authoring studies on **Calliphorinae species**, a subfamily of blow flies, which are significant in forensic entomology and ecological research. Additionally, Gan Yunxing published a study in **ZOLOGICAL RESEARCH** in the year **1980**, indicating a long-standing engagement with the journal and its academic community. These contributions highlight Gan Yunxing’s expertise in entomological research and their role in advancing knowledge related to insect taxonomy, biology, or ecological roles, as Calliphorinae species are often studied for their applications in decomposition processes and biodiversity analysis. The journal **ZOLOGICAL RESEARCH**, in which these works were published, serves as a platform for disseminating zoological findings, particularly in regions where such studies are underrepresented. While the first description specifies the focus on Calliphorinae, the second emphasizes the temporal aspect of a 1980 publication, suggesting that Gan Yunxing’s work spans both specialized taxonomic research and broader zoological topics. Together, these details underscore Gan Yunxing’s academic impact and the journal’s role in publishing diverse zoological studies. The apparent contradiction in the second description—“published 1980 studies”—is resolved by interpreting it as a single study published in 1980, aligning with the typical structure of journal publications and avoiding an implausible claim of 1980 individual studies.
