It is found in Henan, China.\",3\n2079,ZHENGZHOU,\"\n\n**ZHENGZHOU** is a city located in Henan province, China. It is recognized as part of the distribution range of *Calliphora axata*, a species of blow fly commonly associated with forensic entomology and ecological studies. As a major urban center in central China, Zhengzhou serves as the provincial capital of Henan and is strategically positioned along the Yellow River, playing a significant role in the region's transportation, economy, and cultural landscape. The city is a key hub for railway and highway networks, including the Zhengzhou East Railway Station, one of the largest high-speed rail stations in the world. Zhengzhou's historical and modern significance is underscored by its status as a core city in the Central Plains Economic Zone and its designation as a National Historical and Cultural City due to its rich heritage, including ancient walled structures and archaeological sites linked to early Chinese civilization. The inclusion of Zhengzhou in the distribution of *Calliphora axata* highlights its ecological relevance, as the species is often studied for its role in decomposition processes and its utility in estimating postmortem intervals in forensic investigations. This detail aligns with broader scientific interest in the biodiversity of the region, which supports both urban and natural ecosystems. The city's administrative and geographical prominence in Henan province further contextualizes its importance as a focal point for research and development in various fields, including entomology, environmental science, and urban planning. By integrating its role as a metropolitan center with its ecological contributions, Zhengzhou emerges as a multifaceted entity that bridges historical, cultural, and scientific domains within China.\",4\n576,GE,\"\n\n**GE** is a researcher associated with multiple taxonomic descriptions and scientific contributions, primarily in the field of entomology, with a focus on fly species. GE is cited as an author or co-author for several species and subspecies, including **Nupedia henanensis** (described in 1982, often in collaboration with Fan), **Pegomya tenuiramula**, **Paradelia nototrigona** (referred to as \"\"Ge et Fan, 1982\"\"), **Emmesomyia socia suwai**, and the subspecies **Miltogramma ibericum brachygonitum** (noted in the *Zoological Journal*). Additionally, GE co-described **Lasiomma graciliapicum** in 1982, alongside **亚绒粪泉蝇** (a Chinese-named species, likely a synonym or alternative designation). GE is also linked to the description of **Egle rectapica** and **Phaonia mimoaureola**, though the specific roles in these collaborations are not detailed.  \n\nBeyond species descriptions, GE is referenced in scientific texts for earlier works: a 1956 publication and a 1961 reference to Henan, China. These citations suggest a long-standing involvement in entomological research, with a regional focus on Henan. Furthermore, GE is associated with a 1960 collection record in **Zhengzhou, Henan**, indicating fieldwork or research activity in the area. The recurring collaboration with Fan, particularly in 1982, highlights a partnership in documenting biodiversity, as seen in the joint descriptions of *Nupedia henanensis* and *Paradelia nototrigona*.  \n\nThe data collectively portray GE as a contributor to the taxonomy of flies, with a career spanning at least three decades (1950s–1980s). Their work includes both standalone authorship and collaborative efforts, often centered on species from China, particularly Henan Province. The mention of the Chinese name **亚绒粪泉蝇** underscores the regional specificity of some of their research. While the exact nature of GE’s expertise or institutional affiliations is not provided, their repeated citations and co-authorships suggest a significant role in advancing knowledge of dipteran taxonomy during the mid-to-late 20th century.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",13\n1270,NUPEDIA HENANENSIS,\"A species of fly with a gray-black body, yellow legs, and a body length of 3.5–4 mm.
