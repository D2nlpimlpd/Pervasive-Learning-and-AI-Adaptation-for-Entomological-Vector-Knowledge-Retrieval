It is recognized as part of the domestic range for *Dichaetomyia bibax*, a species of fly, and is also home to the distribution of *Lucilia hainanensis*, another fly species associated with the region. Additionally, Guizhou is noted as a habitat for *Protocalliphora azurea*, a species of parasitic fly, further highlighting its role in supporting diverse arthropod populations. The province is also the domestic distribution area for *Eucaulothrix curvifemur* (曲股欧麻蝇), a species of blowfly, which contributes to its ecological importance in entomological studies. These species, all within the order Diptera, underscore Guizhou’s biodiversity and its relevance as a location for research on fly fauna. The province’s unique environmental conditions, including its subtropical climate and varied topography, likely support the presence of these species, which may play roles in decomposition, parasitism, or other ecological processes. While the descriptions provided focus on specific insect distributions, they collectively emphasize Guizhou’s significance in the geographic range of multiple fly species, both in terms of local and broader regional biodiversity. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as all consistently identify Guizhou as a Chinese province and a shared habitat for these species. This synthesis integrates the information to present a unified overview of Guizhou’s ecological contributions to the distribution of *Dichaetomyia bibax*, *Lucilia hainanensis*, *Protocalliphora azurea*, and *Eucaulothrix curvifemur*. The province’s role in harboring these species reflects its importance in the study of dipteran ecology and distribution patterns within China. Further research into the interactions and habitats of these species in Guizhou could provide deeper insights into their life cycles, ecological functions, and conservation needs. Overall, Guizhou stands out as a key location for understanding the diversity and distribution of fly species in East Asia.
