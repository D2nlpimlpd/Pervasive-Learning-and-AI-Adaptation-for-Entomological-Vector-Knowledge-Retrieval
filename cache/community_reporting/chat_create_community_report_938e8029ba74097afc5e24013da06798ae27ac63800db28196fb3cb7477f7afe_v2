BESCHR.,\"\n\n**SYST. BESCHR.** is a publication associated with the organization *Systematic Description*, which has served as a source for taxonomic descriptions of various insect species. The journal, abbreviated as *Syst. Beschr.*, has documented multiple genera and species, including *Nupedia aestiva* and *Nupedia infirma*, *Lispe monochaita*, *Hebecnema fumosa* and *Hebecnema umbratica*, *Hydrotaea palaestrica* (specifically in volume 5, page 135), and *Delia platura* and *Delia antiqua*, the latter two of which were described by the entomologist **Johann Wilhelm Meigen** in 1826. Additionally, the publication has provided taxonomic details for the genus *Haematobia*. While some descriptions attribute the work to *Systematic Description* as an organization, the term \"\"Syst. Beschr.\"\" is consistently used to denote the publication itself, likely derived from the German *Systematische Beschreibung* (Systematic Description). The journal appears to have been a platform for formal taxonomic classifications, with contributions from multiple authors over time, though specific dates for most entries beyond Meigen’s 1826 work are not provided. The inclusion of species from diverse genera (*Nupedia*, *Lispe*, *Hebecnema*, *Hydrotaea*, *Delia*, and *Haematobia*) suggests a broad focus on dipteran taxonomy. The contradiction between the entity being described as both a publication and an organization is resolved by interpreting *SYST. BESCHR.* as the title of the journal produced by the *Systematic Description* organization. This publication has played a role in entomological research by formalizing the classification of these species, with notable entries such as Meigen’s 1826 descriptions of *Delia platura* and *Delia antiqua*. The specific reference to *Hydrotaea palaestrica* in volume 5, page 135, highlights the journal’s structured format for documenting species. Overall, *SYST. BESCHR.* is a historical taxonomic resource that has contributed to the scientific understanding of insect biodiversity, particularly within the Diptera order. Its legacy includes the formal naming and categorization of species, with some entries tied to well-known entomologists like Meigen. The publication’s dual identity as both a journal and the output of an organization underscores its role in systematic biology, though further details about its editorial history or scope remain unspecified in the provided data.\",9\n1277,夏原泉蝇,\"A species of fly (Nupedia aestiva) described by Meigen in 1826, characterized by a central depression on the mesonotum, a preabdominal bristle on the mid-tibia, and a wide median abdominal spot in males.

Additionally, Shantou is part of the distribution range of *ZONGQUAN YANGYING*, though the specific taxonomic or ecological relationship of this entity remains unclear from the provided data. The city holds particular importance in entomological studies as the **mode of origin** for *Fucellia chinensis*, a species of fly, suggesting it is a primary or central location for the species' presence in China. Furthermore, Shantou is the **type locality** for *Fucellia apicalis*, meaning the species was first described and named based on specimens collected there. The city is also associated with *Hebecnema fumosa*, a species of fly, as a specific location within Guangdong where it is documented to occur. These references collectively highlight Shantou's role as a biodiversity hotspot for various fly species, with its coastal and subtropical environment likely contributing to the ecological niches supporting such distributions.
