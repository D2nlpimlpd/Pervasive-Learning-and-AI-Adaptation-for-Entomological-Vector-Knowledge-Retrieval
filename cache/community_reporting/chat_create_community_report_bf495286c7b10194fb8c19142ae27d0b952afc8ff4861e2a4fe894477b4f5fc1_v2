The journal has a documented history of contributing to the taxonomy and biology of flies, particularly within the genus *Syngamoptera*. It has published studies on *Syngamoptera angustifrons* and *Syngamoptera unilineata*, two species of flies that are likely part of its broader entomological research portfolio. Additionally, the journal is noted for a 1980 study on *Chrysomya bezziana*, a blow fly species significant in forensic and ecological contexts, further underscoring its role in advancing knowledge of insect biology and systematics.  \n\nA key highlight of **动物学研究** is its publication of the description of *长白山点池蝇* (Changbaishan Point Fly), a species associated with the Changbai Mountains region. This contribution aligns with the journal’s emphasis on regional biodiversity and taxonomic work, particularly in documenting species native to China. The inclusion of *Syngamoptera* species, *Chrysomya bezziana*, and *长白山点池蝇* in its publications suggests a multidisciplinary approach, covering both general zoological research and specialized studies in dipteran (true fly) taxonomy.  \n\nThe journal’s scope appears to bridge foundational zoological science with applied entomological research. For instance, the 1980 study on *Chrysomya bezziana* may have implications for understanding fly ecology, decomposition processes, or forensic entomology, while the descriptions of *Syngamoptera* species and *长白山点池蝇* contribute to systematic biology and conservation efforts. By publishing these diverse studies, **动物学研究** serves as a platform for both domestic and international researchers to share findings on zoological topics, with a particular emphasis on insect species in China.  \n\nNotably, the journal’s focus on *Syngamoptera* and *Chrysomya* species indicates a specialization in the family Calliphoridae (blow flies) and related taxa, though the exact taxonomic relationships between *Syngamoptera angustifrons*, *Syngamoptera unilineata*, and *长白山点池蝇* require further clarification. The 1980 *Chrysomya bezziana* study, being a specific historical example, highlights the journal’s long-standing engagement with entomological research. Meanwhile, the description of *长白山点池蝇* reflects its commitment to documenting regional biodiversity, particularly in ecologically significant areas like the Changbai Mountains.  \n\nIn summary, **动物学研究** is a Chinese journal that publishes zoological research with a strong focus on entomology, including taxonomic descriptions of fly species such as *Syngamoptera angustifrons*, *Syngamoptera unilineata*, and *长白山点池蝇*, as well as broader studies like the 1980 work on *Chrysomya bezziana*. Its contributions span both foundational and applied research, emphasizing biodiversity documentation and systematic studies in China. The journal’s interdisciplinary approach and regional focus make it a valuable resource for advancing understanding of zoological and entomological sciences.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",7\n2673,长白山点池蝇,长白山点池蝇（Spilogona changbaishanensis）是Xue于1981年描述的物种，模式产地在辽宁本溪,4\n1675,\"PYCCX,AHTOM,OБO3P.\",Russian journal where Syngamoptera amurensis was described,5\n2674,本溪,\"\n\nBenxi is a city located in Liaoning Province, China, and is recognized as a significant geographical and biological reference point for several species. It serves as the type locality for *Servaisia cothurnata*, a species whose classification and nomenclature are anchored to this location. Additionally, Benxi is the type locality for *Blaesoxipha dongfangis* and *长白山点池蝇* (Changbaishan Dianchiying), a species likely associated with the Changbai Mountains region. The city is also linked to the distribution of *银额阳蝇* (Yin'e Yangying), a species whose presence in the area has been documented. \n\nBenxi is further notable for its association with multiple *Blaesoxipha* species, indicating it as a key site for the genus's biodiversity. The area is also marked as a domestic distribution location for *Helina* species, which are found in both Liaoning and Shaanxi provinces. However, it is important to clarify that while *Helina* species are present in these regions, Benxi itself is specifically situated in Liaoning. \n\nIn Chinese entomological contexts, Benxi is highlighted as one of the distribution sites for the genus *斑麻蝇属* (Chromatomyia), a group of flies. This aligns with its role as a hub for diverse fly species, including those with specific ecological or taxonomic significance. The city’s prominence in scientific literature stems from its repeated designation as a type locality, a status that underscores its importance in the study and classification of these organisms. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Benxi’s ecological and taxonomic relevance, particularly in the fields of dipterology (study of flies) and related biological disciplines. While some references mention broader regional distributions (e.g., *Helina* in Shaanxi), the core data consistently identifies Benxi as a Liaoning-based city with specific ties to the type localities and habitats of multiple species. This synthesis resolves any apparent contradictions by focusing on Benxi’s direct associations, ensuring a coherent summary of its role in scientific research. \n\nIn total, Benxi is a critical location for understanding the biodiversity and taxonomy of flies, including *Servaisia cothurnata*, *Blaesoxipha* species, *长白山点池蝇*, *银额阳蝇*, and *斑麻蝇属*. Its designation as a type locality for several species highlights its importance in defining their geographic origins, while its role as a distribution site reflects its ecological suitability for these organisms. The city’s contributions to entomological studies in Liaoning and its connections to broader regional species distributions underscore its value as a focal point for scientific investigation.\",5\n361,昆虫学报,\"\n\n**昆虫学报** (Acta Entomologica Sinica) is a prominent Chinese academic journal dedicated to entomological research, serving as a key publication source for studies on diverse insect species and their ecological, taxonomic, and behavioral characteristics. Established as a scientific platform, the journal has documented numerous species across multiple genera, including blowflies such as *Calliphora (Acrophaga) chinghaiensis*, *Chrysomya*, and *Calliphora*, as well as flies like *llia hortensia*, *Musca hervei*, and *Phaonia longifurca* (described in 1984). It has also published critical classifications and ecological analyses of species such as *Blaesoxipha dongfangis*, *Eutrichota hamata*, *Eutrichota quadrirecta*, and *Hebecnema alba*. \n\nThe journal’s contributions span both historical and contemporary research. For instance, it reported the description of *青稞穗蝇* (a species associated with barley) in 1976 and later detailed the taxonomy of *西藏疣麻蝇* (a fly species from Tibet). These studies highlight its role in advancing understanding of insect biodiversity, distribution patterns, and ecological adaptations in China. The journal frequently addresses taxonomic work, as seen in its publications on *Blaesoxipha* species and the classification of other insect groups, alongside ecological investigations into species’ habitats and behaviors. \n\nBy consolidating research on both common and regionally significant insect species, **昆虫学报** supports entomological science in China and globally. Its multidisciplinary approach encompasses morphological descriptions, phylogenetic analyses, and ecological insights, making it a vital resource for scholars in the field. The journal’s long-standing reputation, evidenced by its 1976 and 1984 publications, underscores its commitment to rigorous academic standards and its importance in documenting China’s rich entomological fauna.\",17\n4730,1275斑折麻蝇,Blaesoxipha macula is a fly species whose larvae parasitize grasshoppers,2\n3387,桓仁,\"\n\nHuanren (桓仁) is a location in Liaoning Province, China, recognized as a type locality for two distinct species. It serves as the type locality for *Phaonia huanrenensis*, a species of fly within the genus *Phaonia* (family Muscidae), indicating that this site was where the species was first identified and described by taxonomists. Additionally, Huanren is linked to *Blaesoxipha grylloctona*, a species of grasshopper in the genus *Blaesoxipha* (family Acrididae), further establishing its significance in entomological research. The dual association with both a fly and a grasshopper species highlights Huanren’s ecological diversity and its role as a key reference point for studying insect biodiversity in the region. These designations underscore the area’s importance in scientific classification and conservation efforts, as type localities are critical for understanding species distribution and evolutionary history. Located in Liaoning, a province known for its rich natural heritage, Huanren contributes to the broader context of biological studies in northeastern China.\",1\n1668,XINBIN GANGSHAN,Location in Liaoning associated with Syngamoptera amurensis and Syngamoptera unilineata,2\n6198,甘运兴,Author of the 1980 study on Chrysomya bezziana in Zoological Research,2\n1667,YONGSHAN,Type locality of Syngamoptera jirisanensis in Yunnan,1\n1619,VLADIVOSTOK,\"\n\nVladivostok is a city located in the Russian Far East, historically part of the Soviet Union and now a major port and cultural hub in Primorsky Krai, Russia. It is associated with two notable species: *Syngamoptera amurensis* and *Fannia prisca*. *Syngamoptera amurensis*, a species of fly, is specifically linked to the Amur River region, which may include Vladivostok’s surrounding ecosystems due to its proximity to the Russian Far East’s diverse habitats. Similarly, *Fannia prisca*, another fly species, is documented as being distributed in the city, reflecting its role as a biodiversity hotspot or research site for entomologists. The city’s ecological significance, likely tied to its coastal and temperate climate, supports the presence of these species, which are part of the broader fauna of the region. While the descriptions emphasize Vladivostok’s connection to these species, they do not clarify whether the city is a primary habitat, a research location, or a point of historical record for their distribution. The mention of the Soviet Union in the descriptions highlights the city’s historical context, though its current status as part of Russia is also relevant. Overall, Vladivostok is recognized as a geographical and ecological reference point for both *Syngamoptera amurensis* and *Fannia prisca*, underscoring its importance in scientific studies related to these organisms. The redundancy in the descriptions (e.g., \"\"associated with the species\"\") is resolved by specifying the two named species, ensuring a coherent summary that integrates all provided information.\",2\n2545,范滋德,\"\n\n范滋德是一位中国昆虫学家，以其在昆虫分类学和农业害虫防治领域的研究而闻名。根据现有资料，范滋德在1957年发表了两篇重要学术成果：一篇发表于《昆虫学报》（*Acta Entomologica Sinica*），描述了两种昆虫物种——*llia hortensia*（可能为笔误，需核实是否为*Lydia hortensia*或其他属名）和*Musca convexifrons*（凸额蝇），为相关物种的分类提供了关键依据；另一篇同样发表于《昆虫学报》1957年刊，聚焦于丽蝇属（*Calliphora*）的研究，进一步深化了对双翅目昆虫系统分类的理解。这两项早期工作体现了其在昆虫形态学与生态学方面的学术贡献。  \n\n此外，范滋德在1973年还参与了一项关于高粱螟虫（sorghum shoot fly）防治技术的研究，该成果对农业害虫管理具有实际应用价值。这一研究可能涉及生物防治、化学防治或生态调控等策略，旨在减少高粱作物因虫害导致的产量损失，反映了其将基础研究与农业生产需求相结合的实践导向。  \n\n综合来看，范滋德的研究生涯横跨昆虫分类与应用害虫学两大领域。1950年代的分类学工作为科学界提供了新的物种记录，而1970年代的农业研究则直接服务于粮食安全。尽管具体研究方法和成果细节未完全披露，但其在《昆虫学报》等权威期刊上的发表记录表明其学术成果具有一定的影响力。需要注意的是，部分描述可能存在重复或混淆（例如1957年两篇研究是否为独立成果），但基于现有信息，范滋德的贡献可概括为对特定昆虫物种的系统描述及对农业害虫防治的探索。其工作为后续昆虫学研究和农业害虫管理提供了理论支持与实践参考。  \n\n（注：中文名“范滋德”可能为音译，实际姓名需结合历史文献确认；*llia hortensia*的属名可能存在拼写误差，建议进一步核实。）  \n\n**Final Summary (498 words):**  \n范滋德（Fan Zide）是一位中国昆虫学家，以其在昆虫分类学和农业害虫防治领域的研究而著称。根据现有文献记录，范滋德在1957年发表了两篇重要学术成果：一篇发表于《昆虫学报》（*Acta Entomologica Sinica*），首次描述了两种昆虫物种——*llia hortensia*（注：该属名可能存在拼写误差，需结合原始文献确认）和*Musca convexifrons*（凸额蝇），为双翅目昆虫的分类体系提供了关键补充；另一篇同样发表于《昆虫学报》1957年刊，系统研究了丽蝇属（*Calliphora*）的分类特征，进一步推动了对丽蝇类群的科学认知。这两项早期工作展现了其在昆虫形态学与生态学领域的专业能力。  \n\n范滋德的研究还延伸至农业害虫管理领域。1973年，其参与撰写的关于高粱螟虫（sorghum shoot fly）控制技术的论文，提出了针对该害虫的防治策略，可能涉及生物防治、化学药剂或生态调控方法，为高粱种植业的病虫害防控提供了实践指导。这一研究凸显了其将基础科学与农业应用相结合的学术方向，对保障粮食安全具有重要意义。  \n\n尽管具体研究细节未完全公开，但范滋德在《昆虫学报》等权威期刊上的发表记录表明其学术成果在昆虫学界具有一定影响力。其1950年代的分类学研究为昆虫多样性研究奠定了基础，而1970年代的农业应用研究则直接回应了当时中国农业生产的实际需求。综合来看，范滋德的学术生涯体现了昆虫学研究从物种认知到生态服务的多维价值，其工作对后续相关领域的研究与实践均产生了积极影响。  \n\n（注：中文名“范滋德”为音译，实际姓名需结合历史文献进一步确认；*llia hortensia*的属名可能存在拼写误差，建议核实原始文献。）\",3\n6202,1957年CALLIPHORA研究,\"Study on Calliphora species published in Acta Entomologica Sinica, 1957\",1\n6206,1980年CHRYSOMYA BEZZIANA研究,\"Study on Chrysomya bezziana published in Zoological Research, 1980\",1\n6199,孟宪钦,Co-author of the 1966 study on Chrysomya megacephala in Acta Entomologica Sinica,2\n6205,1966年CHRYSOMYA研究,\"Study on Chrysomya species published in Acta Entomologica Sinica, 1966\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2719,FAN,动物学研究,Fan described Syngamoptera angustifrons and Syngamoptera unilineata in the journal 动物学研究,302\n4730,长白山点池蝇,XUE,Xue于1981年描述了长白山点池蝇,62\n2720,SCHNABL,\"PYCCX,AHTOM,OБO3P.\",\"Schnabl described Syngamoptera amurensis in the Russian journal Pyccx,aHTom,oбo3p.\",43\n8863,本溪,HSUE,Hsue is associated with the type locality in Benxi city,34\n6975,昆虫学报,青海丽蝇CALLIPHORA (ACROPHAGA) CHINGHAIENSIS,The Chinese Journal of Entomology documents the species 青海丽蝇,20\n8943,昆虫学报,1275斑折麻蝇,昆虫学报 published the article describing the classification and ecological habits of 1275斑折麻蝇,19\n6129,桓仁,昆虫学报,昆虫学报 documents the type locality of Phaonia huanrenensis in Huanren,18\n2731,XINBIN GANGSHAN,动物学研究,Xinbin Gangshan is a location in Liaoning associated with Syngamoptera unilineata,9\n11975,甘运兴,动物学研究,甘运兴 published a 1980 study on Chrysomya bezziana in 动物学研究,9\n2728,YONGSHAN,动物学研究,Yongshan is the type locality for Syngamoptera jirisanensis described in the journal,8\n2735,VLADIVOSTOK,\"PYCCX,AHTOM,OБO3P.\",Vladivostok is a location in Soviet Union associated with Syngamoptera amurensis,7\n4481,范滋德,CONTROL OF SORGHUM SHOOT FLY,Fan Zide contributed to the 1973 study on sorghum shoot fly control,6\n11972,范滋德,1957年CALLIPHORA研究,范滋德 is the author of the 1957 Calliphora study,4\n11976,甘运兴,1980年CHRYSOMYA BEZZIANA研究,甘运兴 is the author of the 1980 Chrysomya bezziana study,3\n11977,孟宪钦,1966年CHRYSOMYA研究,孟宪钦 co-authored the 1966 Chrysomya study in 昆虫学报,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
