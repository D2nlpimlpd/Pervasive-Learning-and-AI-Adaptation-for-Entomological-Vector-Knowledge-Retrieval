He is best known for his contributions to the study of fly species, particularly in the mid-20th century. In 1957, Fan Zide authored multiple significant works, including a study on fly species published in the *Acta Entomologica Sinica* and a separate article in the *Journal of Entomology*. His 1957 research also specifically focused on the species *Calliphora vomitoria*, a blowfly commonly associated with forensic and ecological studies. Additionally, he conducted a 1959 report on *Fannia* species in Shanghai, further expanding his expertise in regional fly taxonomy and ecology.  \n\nBeyond his early research, Fan Zide played a pivotal role in advancing entomological knowledge in China through editorial and leadership positions. He served as the editor-in-chief of the second edition of the authoritative monograph *\"\"Key to the Common Flies of China,\"\"* published in 1992. This work, for which he was the primary author, became a foundational resource for identifying and classifying fly species in the region. His affiliation with the East China Institute of Entomology and his role as head of the Shanghai Institute of Entomology underscored his leadership in the field. These institutions, both based in Shanghai, were central to his research and editorial endeavors, reflecting his deep connection to the city’s scientific community.  \n\nFan Zide’s career highlights his dual focus on empirical research and knowledge dissemination. His 1957 studies in *Acta Entomologica Sinica* and the *Journal of Entomology* established him as a key figure in fly taxonomy, while his 1959 report on *Fannia* species demonstrated his commitment to regional entomological analysis. The 1992 edition of the *\"\"Key to the Common Flies of China\"\"* solidified his legacy as a leading authority, combining his research with collaborative efforts to standardize classification methods. His work at the East China Institute of Entomology and Shanghai Institute of Entomology further positioned him as a central figure in Chinese entomology, bridging academic research and practical applications.  \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in identifying Fan Zide as a prolific author, editor, and institutional leader in entomology. While some details overlap (e.g., the 1957 studies in different journals), they collectively emphasize his expertise in fly species and his role in advancing entomological science in China. His contributions spanned both foundational research and the curation of critical taxonomic resources, ensuring his influence endured across generations of scientists. Fan Zide’s career remains a cornerstone in the study of Chinese flies, with his publications and editorial work continuing to reference his meticulous approach to classification and regional biodiversity.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",11\n1,SCIENCE PRESS,\"Science Press is the publisher of the second edition of the \"\"Key to the Common Flies of China\"\"\",2\n75,ZHONG JIANPING,Spouse of Fan Zide who provided extensive support for the book's revision and completion,1\n110,CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES EAST CHINA INSTITUTE OF ENTOMOLOGY,\"The East China Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, where the book was completed and where Fan Zide is affiliated\",1\n6148,1957 ENTOMOLOGY JOURNAL ARTICLE,Article published in the Entomology Journal in 1957,1\n6153,1957 STUDY IN ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,Research on fly species by Fan Zide published in Acta Entomologica Sinica,1\n6196,PUBLICATION BY FAN ZIDE IN 1957,Fan Zide's 1957 publication in *Acta Entomologica Sinica* on *Calliphora vomitoria*,1\n76,ZHANG MENG YU,\"\n\n**ZHANG MENG YU** is an individual associated with two distinct academic contributions. First, they are recognized as an author who conducted research on blowfly species in the 1990s, with their work published in Chinese journals. This research likely pertains to entomology, potentially focusing on taxonomy, ecology, or forensic applications of blowflies, given the species' relevance in scientific and medical contexts. The specific details of the 1990 study, such as the species examined or methodologies employed, remain unspecified, but it marks an early scholarly contribution to the field in China.  \n\nSecond, ZHANG MENG YU is identified as an individual affiliated with Hebei Medical College, a higher education institution in China. Their role there involved assisting in the completion of a book, though the subject of the book is not explicitly stated. Given the college’s focus on medical education and research, the book may relate to medical science, public health, or a specialized field within the institution’s academic scope. This collaboration suggests involvement in academic writing, editing, or research support, aligning with their possible expertise in a medical or biological discipline.  \n\nThe apparent contradiction between these two roles—blowfly research and medical college book assistance—can be reconciled by considering the interdisciplinary nature of entomology and its applications in medicine. Blowfly species are often studied for their roles in forensic entomology (e.g., estimating time of death) and disease transmission, areas that intersect with medical research. It is plausible that ZHANG MENG YU’s work on blowflies was part of a broader scientific or medical project, and their later involvement with Hebei Medical College could have been in a related capacity, such as contributing to a textbook on forensic science, parasitology, or public health. Alternatively, the two descriptions may refer to separate individuals with the same name, though the data provided does not clarify this.  \n\nIn summary, ZHANG MENG YU is linked to both a 1990 entomological study on blowflies in Chinese journals and a collaborative effort at Hebei Medical College to complete a book. These contributions highlight their potential engagement with biological sciences and medical academia, though the exact relationship between the two roles remains contextually inferred. The entity’s work underscores the intersection of entomology and medical research, particularly in regions like China where such studies may have practical or educational significance.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",2\n84,PUBLICATION OF SECOND EDITION,The 1992 release of the revised monograph on Chinese calyptrate flies,6\n77,WU WENJIE,Person who contributed illustrations for the muscoid subfamily,1\n78,TAO ZHENG LIANG,Individual who assisted with manuscript copying work,1\n85,PUBLICATION OF FIRST EDITION,The 1965 initial release of the monograph on synanthropic flies,1\n3,SECOND EDITION,\"The second edition of the \"\"Key to the Common Flies of China\"\" was published in 1992, expanding on the 1965 first edition\",3\n4,FIRST EDITION,,1\n6220,CHINESE JOURNAL OF VECTOR BIOLOGY AND CONTROL,Journal where Zhang Meng Yu and Wu Xin Sheng published their 1990 research,2\n6219,WU XIN SHENG,Co-author with Zhang Meng Yu on 1990 blowfly study,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11883,JINZHOU CITY HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,1959 REPORT IN SHANGHAI,The station conducted the 1959 report in Shanghai,15\n11884,JINZHOU CITY HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,1957 STUDY,The station conducted the 1957 study on Graphomya,14\n0,FAN ZIDE,SCIENCE PRESS,Fan Zide edited the second edition of the fly key published by Science Press,13\n67,FAN ZIDE,ZHONG JIANPING,Fan Zide's spouse provided critical support for the book's completion,12\n72,FAN ZIDE,CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES EAST CHINA INSTITUTE OF ENTOMOLOGY,Fan Zide is the editor-in-chief affiliated with the East China Institute of Entomology,12\n11898,FAN ZIDE,1957 ENTOMOLOGY JOURNAL ARTICLE,Fan Zide authored the 1957 journal article,12\n11911,FAN ZIDE,1957 STUDY IN ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA SINICA,Fan Zide authored the 1957 study on fly species in Acta Entomologica Sinica,12\n11971,FAN ZIDE,PUBLICATION BY FAN ZIDE IN 1957,Fan Zide authored the 1957 publication,12\n68,ZHANG MENG YU,PUBLICATION OF SECOND EDITION,Provided assistance during the book's finalization,8\n69,WU WENJIE,PUBLICATION OF SECOND EDITION,Contributed illustrations for the muscoid subfamily,7\n70,TAO ZHENG LIANG,PUBLICATION OF SECOND EDITION,Assisted with manuscript copying work,7\n71,PUBLICATION OF SECOND EDITION,PUBLICATION OF FIRST EDITION,Second edition is a revised version of the first edition,7\n1,SCIENCE PRESS,SECOND EDITION,Science Press published the second edition of the fly key,5\n3,SECOND EDITION,FIRST EDITION,The second edition is a revised and expanded version of the 1965 first edition,4\n12009,ZHANG MENG YU,CHINESE JOURNAL OF VECTOR BIOLOGY AND CONTROL,ZHANG MENG YU co-authored a 1990 blowfly study in this journal,4\n12010,WU XIN SHENG,CHINESE JOURNAL OF VECTOR BIOLOGY AND CONTROL,WU XIN SHENG co-authored a 1990 blowfly study in this journal,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
