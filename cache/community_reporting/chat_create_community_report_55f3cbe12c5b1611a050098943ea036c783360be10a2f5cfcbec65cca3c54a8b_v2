It was first described by the entomologist Hennig in 1968, with its type locality identified in the Harbin area of Heilongjiang, China. The species is characterized by a body length of 4–5 mm, as noted in taxonomic literature. Its distribution spans multiple regions in China, including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Beijing, Hunan, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shanghai, as well as North America internationally. \n\nThe larvae of *Lasiomma pectinicrus* are known to breed in organic substrates such as pig dung, human dung, and animal hair, which provides insight into their ecological niche and life cycle. This information is critical for understanding their role in decomposition processes and potential interactions with livestock or human environments. \n\nTaxonomically, the species is documented in the publication *\"\"In Lindner: Anthomyiidae, Flieg. palaearkt.

This distinction ensures accurate nomenclature and avoids confusion in subsequent research. \n\nIn summary, *Lasiomma pectinicrus* is a small, dung-breeding fly species with a broad geographic range across China and North America. Its taxonomic history includes a clarification of nomenclatural errors related to *Hylemyia subciliata*, and its morphology and ecology are detailed in Hennig’s 1968 work, with an illustration in the referenced publication.
