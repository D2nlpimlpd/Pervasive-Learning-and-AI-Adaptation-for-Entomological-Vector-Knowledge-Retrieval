First described by the French entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863, the genus is characterized by a distinctive flat occiput (the posterior part of the head) adorned with black bristles, a key morphological trait used for identification. BESSA species are primarily native to China, where they are most commonly encountered, but their distribution extends to other regions, including Europe, Siberia, and Japan. This geographic range suggests a degree of adaptability to diverse temperate and boreal climates. As members of the Exoristini tribe, BESSA flies likely exhibit ecological roles typical of tachinids, such as regulating populations of insect hosts through parasitism. The combination of their unique anatomical features and broad distribution highlights their significance in both taxonomic studies and ecological contexts. The genus remains a subject of interest for entomologists due to its morphological distinctiveness and the potential for further research into its life history, host interactions, and biogeographic patterns.

This genus is distinguished by specific morphological traits, particularly in its wing venation and bristle patterns, which are key characteristics used to classify and identify its members. As part of the Tachinidae family, Austrophorocera species are parasitoid flies, typically playing a role in regulating populations of their host insects. The placement of the genus within the Exoristini tribe further situates it among a group of tachinids known for their ecological and taxonomic diversity. The original description by Townsend established the foundational taxonomy, while subsequent studies have emphasized the diagnostic features of wing structure and bristle arrangement as critical for differentiating Austrophorocera from related genera. These traits contribute to the broader understanding of tachinid fly evolution and systematics, highlighting the genus’s significance in entomological research. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the taxonomic classification, the describer, and the defining morphological attributes.
