ENT.,\"\n\n**ENCYCL. ENT.** is a journal that has served as a publication platform for multiple species within the genus *Isomyia*. Specifically, it is noted as the journal where *Isomyia latimarginata* and *Isomyia pichoni* were first described. Additionally, the journal documented the description of *Isomyia oestracea* by the entomologist Seguy in 1934. These entries collectively highlight the journal's role in advancing taxonomic knowledge of the *Isomyia* genus, a group of flies within the family Tachinidae. The descriptions of these species in **ENCYCL. ENT.** contribute to the broader scientific understanding of their morphology, ecology, and classification. While the first two species (*I. latimarginata* and *I. pichoni*) are mentioned without specific authors or years, the inclusion of Seguy's 1934 work on *I. oestracea* underscores the journal's historical significance in entomological research. The absence of conflicting details in the provided data allows for a unified summary, emphasizing the journal's contributions to documenting *Isomyia* species across different studies. **ENCYCL.

This information underscores the significance of Dang He in entomological studies, particularly in the context of the species' original documentation. The entity name \"\"DANG HE\"\" is likely a misspelling or variant of a known location, but based on the data, it is definitively linked to Laos as the type locality for *Isomyia isomyia*.
