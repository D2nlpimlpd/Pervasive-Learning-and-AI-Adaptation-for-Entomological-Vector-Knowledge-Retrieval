It is characterized by a short or absent pharyngeal appendage and prominent posterior projections, distinguishing it morphologically. The larvae of this species are known to breed in animal carcasses, a key ecological trait. \n\nThe taxonomic history of *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* involves multiple contributions. The genus *Hemipyrellia* was first described by Wiedemann in 1830 and later revised by Aubertin in 1931. However, the species *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* itself was formally described by Ishijima in 1967 in the *Japan Journal of Sanitary Zoology* and subsequently by Gan Yunxing in 1980 in *Zoological Research*. These descriptions likely reflect regional rediscoveries or taxonomic clarifications, as the species name appears to have been established in the mid-20th century despite the genus being older. \n\nThe apparent contradiction in the descriptions—Wiedemann and Aubertin’s earlier work versus Ishijima and Gan’s later accounts—is resolved by recognizing that Wiedemann (1830) and Aubertin (1931) described the broader *Hemipyrellia* genus, while Ishijima (1967) and Gan (1980) specifically documented *Hemipyrellia ligurriens*. This clarifies that the species was not originally named by Wiedemann or Aubertin but rather by the latter two authors within the existing genus framework. \n\nIn summary, *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* is a Calliphorinae fly species with distinct anatomical features and a necrophagous larval stage. Its taxonomic lineage traces back to Wiedemann’s 1830 genus description, with the species itself being formally recognized in 1967 and 1980 by Ishijima and Gan, respectively. The species’ ecological role in decomposition and its morphological traits align it with other members of the subfamily, though its specific adaptations (e.g., pharyngeal appendage reduction) highlight unique evolutionary characteristics.\",4\n6189,ANIMAL CARCASSES,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n6816,HEMIPYRELLIA LIGURRIENS,AUBERTIN,Aubertin described Hemipyrellia ligurriens and documented its distribution,11\n11957,HEMIPYRELLIA LIGURRIENS,ANIMAL CARCASSES,Hemipyrellia ligurriens larvae breed in animal carcasses,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
