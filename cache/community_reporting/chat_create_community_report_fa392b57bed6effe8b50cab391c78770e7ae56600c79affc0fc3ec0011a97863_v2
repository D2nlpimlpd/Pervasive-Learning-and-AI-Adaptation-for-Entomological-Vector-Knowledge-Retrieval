For example, **Myxexoristops blondeli** and **Eumetopiella (lntermedia) luridimacula** are documented in **Baohua Mountain**, while **Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia** occurs in **Wofosi** and **Yanqing**. The **Brush Spring Fly** and **Calliphora axata** are distributed in Beijing, and **Protocalliphora azurea** larvae have been found in **sparrow nests**. Additionally, **1256黑须污蝇** (a Chinese species name) and **圆斑莠蝇** (another Chinese species name) are noted as part of its fauna.  \n\nBeijing is further associated with the **genera** *Kramerea* (*Kramerea schuetzei*), *Bessa*, *Hyleorus elatus*, and *Bellardia* (*Bellardia benshiensis*, *Bellardia menechma*). The **Blue-Black栉寄蝇** (*Pales pavida*) and **Charcoal-Black栉寄蝇** (*Pales carbonata*) are specifically mentioned as distributed in the city.

The city’s ecological diversity supports both native and potentially invasive species, such as **Musca bezzii** and **Musca conducens**, while its status as a type locality underscores its importance in entomological taxonomy.

Specific examples include the **1431家蚕追寄蝇** (a tachinid fly species, likely *Exorista sorbillans*), **Meigenia grandigena** (a parasitoid fly species), and **Stomorhina lunata** (a species of tachinid fly). These species are part of Madagascar’s unique ecological assemblage, which has evolved in relative isolation due to the island’s geographic separation from mainland Africa. The data also references a general statement that \"\"the species is distributed\"\" in Madagascar, though no further details are provided for this unspecified entity. Collectively, the descriptions underscore Madagascar’s role as a critical area for the study and conservation of fly species, particularly those with specialized ecological functions such as parasitism. The island’s distinct ecosystems, ranging from rainforests to arid regions, likely contribute to the diversity and distribution of these organisms. While the term \"\"foreign region\"\" in the first description may reflect a perspective from outside Madagascar, the summaries consistently align with its identity as a sovereign country and a biologically rich location. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all references to Madagascar as a distribution site for these species are harmonized within the context of its geographic and ecological uniqueness.
