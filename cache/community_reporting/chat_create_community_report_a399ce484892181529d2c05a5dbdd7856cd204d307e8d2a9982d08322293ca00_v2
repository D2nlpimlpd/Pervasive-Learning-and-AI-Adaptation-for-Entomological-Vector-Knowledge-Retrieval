The Qilian Mountains, a significant geographical feature, are associated with the species *Delia nigribasis*, which is linked to this area in ecological or taxonomic contexts. Additionally, the Qilian region serves as the type locality for two other species: *Paraprosalpia magnilamella* and *Paregle densibarbata*. A type locality refers to the specific geographic location where a species is first discovered and described, making Qilian a critical site for entomological research.  \n\nThe Qilian County, administratively part of Qinghai Province, is situated within or adjacent to the Qilian Mountains, reflecting the region’s naming consistency with its natural landmarks. While the descriptions do not explicitly clarify the exact relationship between the county and the mountain range, it is reasonable to infer that the county is geographically embedded in the broader Qilian Mountains area, which spans multiple regions in Qinghai and Gansu provinces. This alignment of names suggests a shared cultural, ecological, or administrative identity tied to the mountain range.  \n\nThe presence of multiple species with Qilian as their type locality or associated habitat highlights the area’s biodiversity and its importance in scientific classification. *Paraprosalpia magnilamella* and *Paregle densibarbata* are likely endemic or uniquely documented in this region, underscoring Qilian’s ecological distinctiveness. Meanwhile, *Delia nigribasis* may have a broader distribution but is specifically noted in connection to the Qilian Mountains, possibly due to its habitat preferences or historical taxonomic studies.  \n\nIn summary, QILIAN represents both a natural mountain range and a county in Qinghai Province, with the former being a key ecological and taxonomic reference point for several species. The region’s dual identity as a geographical feature and administrative division emphasizes its role in both local governance and scientific research. The association of *Delia nigribasis* with the Qilian Mountains and the designation of Qilian as the type locality for *Paraprosalpia magnilamella* and *Paregle densibarbata* collectively illustrate the area’s significance in entomology and its contribution to understanding regional biodiversity. By integrating these perspectives, Qilian emerges as a vital nexus of natural and administrative importance in western China.  \n\n(Word count: 249)\",4\n1186,BOTANOPHILA TRIDIGITATA,,5\n1183,CANGQIAN,\"Location in Qinghai, China, serving as the type locality for Monochrotogaster rufifrons\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1563,PAREGLE DENSIBARBATA,FAN,Fan described the species Paregle densibarbata in 1982,302\n2056,PARAPROSALPIA MAGNILAMELLA,FAN,Fan described Paraprosalpia magnilamella in 1983,298\n1667,MONOCHROTOGASTER RUFIFRONS,CHEN,CHEN is the co-author of the species Monochrotogaster rufifrons,57\n1650,ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH JOURNAL,MONOCHROTOGASTER ATRICORNIS,The species Monochrotogaster atricornis was published in the Entomological Research Journal,16\n1326,DELIA NIGRIBASIS,QILIAN,\"Delia nigribasis is found in Qilian, Qinghai\",9\n1669,BOTANOPHILA TRIDIGITATA,QILIAN,The species Botanophila tridigitata originates from Qilian in Qinghai,9\n1661,CANGQIAN,MONOCHROTOGASTER RUFIFRONS,The species Monochrotogaster rufifrons originates from Cangqian in Qinghai,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
