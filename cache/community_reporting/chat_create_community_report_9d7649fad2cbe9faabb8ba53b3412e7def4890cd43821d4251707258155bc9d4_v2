It serves as the type locality for **Meliniella bisinuata**, **Hydrotaea mimopilipes**, **Delia conversata**, **Polietes nigrolimbata**, and **Leucophora tavastica**, indicating that these species were first described based on specimens collected there. Additionally, Finland is the type locality for **角缘花蝇** (*Delia canescens*), a species native to the region. The country hosts a range of distributed species, including **Helina bohemani**, **Helina ciliata**, and **Helina longicornis** (all within the genus *Helina*), as well as **Coenosia octopunctata** and **Coenosia flavicornis** (genus *Coenosia*). **Lasiomma curtigena** and **Eglconcomitans** are also documented as distributed in Finland, with the former being specifically noted as having its type locality in the country. \n\nFinland is part of the international distribution range for **Periscepsia carbonaria**, a species found beyond its native regions, and it is a key location for **Periscepsia** as a genus. The country supports **Ph. pallidisquama** (likely *Phaonia pallidisquama* or a related species) and **Paraprosalpia sepiella**, both of which are recorded in its fauna. **Delia cuneata** and **Delia floricola** are further examples of species associated with Finland, contributing to its biodiversity in the Delia genus. **Phaonia nigripennis** is described as distributed abroad, but the context implies Finland is one of its habitats. \n\nThe descriptions collectively highlight Finland’s ecological significance as a hub for diverse fly species, particularly in the genera *Helina*, *Coenosia*, *Delia*, *Phaonia*, and *Periscepsia*. Its status as a type locality for multiple species underscores its importance in taxonomic research. While some entries specify Finland as a type locality, others emphasize its role as a distribution site, with no contradictions in the data. The country’s position in Northern Europe and its varied habitats likely support this rich entomological diversity.

Their work spanned multiple genera, including *Meliniella*, *Leucophora*, *Pegomyza*, *Phaonia*, *Phorbia*, *Chirosia*, and *Delia*, with descriptions published in scientific journals such as *Ann. Ent. Fenn.* (Annales Entomologici Fennici).  \n\nTIENSUU first described *Meliniella bisinuata* in 1939, a species within the genus *Meliniella*. The same year, they also documented *Leucophora tavastica*, contributing to the taxonomy of the *Leucophora* genus. In 1938, TIENSUU authored the species *Pegomyza consanguinea* and *角缘花蝇* (likely the Chinese name for *Pegomyza consanguinea*), both published in *Ann. Ent. Fenn.*, indicating their focus on *Pegomyza* species during this period. Their 1935 work included the description of *Phorbia securis*, while *Chirosia similata* was added to the scientific record in 1939.  \n\nIn 1946, TIENSUU expanded their research by describing *Phaonia fugax* and *Delia cuneata* (also cited as *Delia cuneata* Tiensuu, 1946). Additionally, they were associated with the description of *Delia conversata*, though the exact year is unspecified in the data. TIENSUU’s expertise in *Delia* species is further highlighted by their 1946 work on *Delia cuneata*.  \n\nBeyond species descriptions, TIENSUU was cited in ecological studies related to *Pegohylemyia* species in Finland, suggesting their involvement in broader entomological research, including ecological contexts. Their publications and taxonomic work reflect a focus on the biodiversity and systematics of flies, particularly in the Nordic region.  \n\nTIENSUU’s legacy includes foundational contributions to the understanding of dipteran taxonomy, with species descriptions spanning over a decade and multiple genera. Their work in *Ann. Ent. Fenn.* and other journals remains a critical reference for entomologists studying these taxa.

Additionally, *Coenosia octopunctata*, a species of fruit fly, is found in Norway, contributing to its ecological biodiversity. The moth *Paraprosalpia sepiella* is also reported to be distributed in the region, further highlighting Norway’s role as a habitat for varied invertebrates. Another species, *Polietes nigrolimbata*, a type of hoverfly, is similarly noted as distributed in Norway. Beyond its natural habitats, Norway is associated with the publication *Dipt.

This publication underscores Norway’s significance in entomological research, particularly for documenting and studying the distribution of flies in the region. Collectively, these records illustrate Norway’s ecological importance as a location where multiple insect species, including both flies and moths, thrive, supported by its diverse environments and active scientific contributions to taxonomy and biodiversity studies.
