Described in 1824\",12\n1609,GLAUCESCENS FANNIA,\"Fannia glaucescens is a species of fly described by Zetterstedt in 1845, found in Heilongjiang (Daxing'anling), Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia (Baotou, Baoyuan), and Shanxi (Huairen, Yungang, Shuoxian) in China, and in Mongolia, Sweden, and North America abroad\",14\n1196,DAXING'ANLING,\"\n\n**DAXING'ANLING** is a mountain range and ecological region located in northern China, spanning the provinces of **Inner Mongolia** and **Heilongjiang**. It is recognized as a significant geographical and biodiversity hotspot, with its distribution and ecological characteristics tied to multiple species of flies. The region is associated with the **Mydaea setifemur**, a species documented in the mountain range of Inner Mongolia. Additionally, **Phaonia hybrida** and **Phaonia alpicola** are part of the fly fauna in the Heilongjiang region of Daxing'anling, while **Phaonia malaisei** is specifically noted in Inner Mongolia. The area also supports **Helina longicornis** and other related species, highlighting its role as a habitat for diverse dipteran populations. \n\nEcologically, Daxing'anling is notable for its cold climate and unique microhabitats, such as ice blocks, where the **Brush Spring Fly** (likely a common name for a species in the Phaonia or Mydaea genera) is collected. This suggests the region’s high-altitude or subarctic environments provide specialized niches for these insects. The mountain range’s transitional location between Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang contributes to its ecological significance, as it bridges temperate and boreal ecosystems. \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize its status as a mountain range in Inner Mongolia, others focus on its regional extent in Heilongjiang, reflecting its geographical continuity across both provinces. The presence of multiple Phaonia species (e.g., *hybrida*, *alpicola*, *malaisei*) and other taxa underscores Daxing'anling’s importance in entomological studies, particularly for understanding high-latitude or high-altitude adaptations. The region’s association with these species, along with its icy terrain, positions it as a key area for research into cold-climate insect ecology and distribution patterns. \n\nIn summary, **Daxing'anling** is a transprovincial mountain range in northern China, encompassing parts of Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang, and serves as a critical habitat for several fly species, including *Mydaea setifemur*, *Phaonia hybrida*, *Helina longicornis*, *Phaonia alpicola*, and *Phaonia malaisei*. Its ecological features, such as ice block environments, further support the presence of the Brush Spring Fly, making it a focal point for studying insect biodiversity in cold regions.
