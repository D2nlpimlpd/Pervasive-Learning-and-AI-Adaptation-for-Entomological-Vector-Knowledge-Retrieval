It lacks spines on the hind tibia, a trait that differentiates it from related species. The second antennal segment exhibits a yellow tip, while the fly’s bristle distribution includes small bristles adjacent to the first and second pairs of bristles, as well as dense bristles near the middle of the fifth abdominal plate. These physical traits were first described by Fan in 1964, establishing the species’ taxonomic foundation.  \n\nThe species is reported to have a domestic distribution in China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Hunan (Mangshan), and Fujian. However, the provided data contains a contradiction regarding its type locality, which is stated as Sweden. This discrepancy likely reflects an error, as the species’ scientific name and described distribution align with Chinese entomological records. The type locality for *Pegomya phyllostachys* is more plausibly within its native range in China, given the absence of supporting evidence for a Swedish origin. This inconsistency should be clarified in future taxonomic revisions.  \n\nIn summary, *Pegomya phyllostachys* is a 7.5 mm fly with unique bristle and antennal features, native to southeastern China. Its description by Fan in 1964 remains the primary reference, though the reported type locality in Sweden requires verification to resolve the conflict with its documented geographic range.\",9\n1367,JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,\"\n\nThe *Journal of Entomological Research* (昆虫学研究集刊) is a publication source for descriptions of insect species, including those from the genera *Paraprosalpia* and *Pegomya*.
