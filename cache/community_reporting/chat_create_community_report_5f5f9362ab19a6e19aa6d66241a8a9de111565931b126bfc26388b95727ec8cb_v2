It documents a range of taxa, including **Leucophora hangzhouensis**, a species referenced within its pages, as well as **Delia jilinensis** and **Delia gansuensis**, which are explicitly noted as being recorded in the work. These species, belonging to the genera *Leucophora* and *Delia*, are part of the broader insect fauna cataloged in the publication, which focuses on species with relevance to agriculture, ecology, and pest management. The inclusion of *Leucophora hangzhouensis* and the two *Delia* species underscores the publication’s role in compiling data on both native and potentially invasive insects that impact China’s economic and environmental systems. By providing detailed descriptions and classifications, the **Chinese Economic Insect Fauna** supports research, policy-making, and conservation efforts related to insect biodiversity and its economic implications. The work is likely used by entomologists, agricultural scientists, and policymakers to identify and manage insect populations critical to China’s ecosystems and industries. No contradictions exist in the provided descriptions, as all references align to highlight the publication’s scope and the specific species it includes.\",4\n1083,LEUCOPHORA HANGZHOUENSIS,\"Leucophora hangzhouensis is a species of fly described by Fan in 1988, found in Zhejiang (Hangzhou, type locality). It has 26 (21) bristles and a narrow interfrontal space on the frons.

It is recognized as a domestic distribution region for *Enneastigma shanghaiensis*, a species native to the area, and is also part of the distribution range for *Calliphora axata*, a blowfly species commonly found in the region. Additionally, Hangzhou is the type locality for *Leucophora hangzhouensis*, meaning the species was first identified and described based on specimens collected there. These associations highlight Hangzhou’s role in biodiversity studies, particularly for entomological research. The city’s inclusion in the distribution of both *Enneastigma shanghaiensis* and *Calliphora axata* underscores its ecological relevance as a habitat for these organisms, while its status as the type locality for *Leucophora hangzhouensis* emphasizes its importance in taxonomic classification. All descriptions consistently identify Hangzhou as situated in Zhejiang province, China, with no contradictions in its geographical context. The information collectively positions Hangzhou as a key location for understanding the natural history and distribution patterns of these species.\",4\n2525,CHONG'AN,\"\n\nChong'an is a location in Fujian Province, China, recognized for its ecological significance and biodiversity. It is associated with multiple species of insects, particularly flies, and serves as a key site for entomological research. The area is linked to **Atherigona reversura**, a species documented in the region, and also supports the distribution of **Atherigona triglomerata**, another fly species within the same genus. Additionally, Chong'an is the **type locality** for **Polleniopsis fukienensis**, meaning this species was first discovered and described from this specific location, underscoring its importance in taxonomic studies. The region further contributes to the habitat range of **Isomyia electa**, a member of the Syrphidae family (hoverflies), which is part of the broader distribution network for this species. These associations highlight Chong'an's role as a critical area for understanding the distribution, ecology, and taxonomy of diverse insect populations in subtropical China. The presence of multiple species, including both Atherigona and Isomyia, reflects the region's varied ecosystems and its value as a reference point for scientific investigations into local arthropod communities. While the descriptions focus on different species, they collectively emphasize Chong'an's status as a biologically rich and scientifically notable locality in Fujian.\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1356,JILIN,CHINESE ECONOMIC INSECT FAUNA,This publication documents species found in Jilin,129\n1442,LEUCOPHORA HANGZHOUENSIS,ZHEJIANG,Leucophora hangzhouensis is distributed in Zhejiang,112\n8159,杭州等彩蝇,SEGUY,Seguy described the species Isomyia pichoni,25\n8164,杭州等彩蝇,TAISHUN,Isomyia pichoni is distributed in Taishun,10\n8165,杭州等彩蝇,YANDANGSHAN,Isomyia pichoni is distributed in Yandangshan,10\n1443,LEUCOPHORA HANGZHOUENSIS,HANGZHOU,Hangzhou in Zhejiang is the type locality for Leucophora hangzhouensis,9\n7285,CHONG'AN,POLLENIOPSIS FUKIENENSIS,Chong'an is the type locality for Polleniopsis fukienensis,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
