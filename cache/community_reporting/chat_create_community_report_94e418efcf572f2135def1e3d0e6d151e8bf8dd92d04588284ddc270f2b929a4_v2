His work spans multiple decades, with notable publications beginning in 1966. In that year, he co-authored the description of *Protocalliphora maruyamensis* and, alongside Kano, described *Stomoxys uruma*. By 1968, Shinonaga was actively involved in documenting the distribution of flies in Micronesia, collaborating with Kano on a study of *Melinda* species and contributing to a broader 1968 report on fly species characteristics. He also co-authored the 1968 documentation of *Neomyia indica* in Thailand and was cited for specimen collection in Japan.  \n\nIn 1969, Shinonaga expanded his research to include the study of *Iranihindia*, a genus of flies. The following year, 1970, marked his description of *Neomyia ruficornis*, further solidifying his expertise in the *Neomyia* genus. In 1973, he co-authored a fly species report and conducted a detailed study of the *Neomyia* genus, demonstrating his ongoing focus on this group. His 1979 work was particularly prolific: he proposed the synonymy of *Pierretia melania* for *Dinemomyia nigribasicosta*, co-established the genus *Kanomyia*, and described the genus *Hosarcophaga*. Additionally, he co-described *Huckettomyia watanabei* and *Megophyra simpliceps*, and was associated with the species *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Paradichosia tsukamotoi*.  \n\nShinonaga’s taxonomic contributions include the description of several species, such as *Phaonia bambusa*, *Phaonia fuscitibia*, *Phaonia ryukyuensis*, and *Ophyra okazakii*, as well as the genus *Xanthotryxus* in 1968. He also provided the type locality for *Brontaea ezensis*, a critical detail for its classification. His collaborative efforts, particularly with Kano, were instrumental in advancing the understanding of fly biodiversity in regions like Japan, Micronesia, and Taiwan, as evidenced by his co-authorship on the 1966 *Protocalliphora maruyamensis* and 1968 *Melinda* species studies.  \n\nShinonaga’s work reflects a multidisciplinary approach, addressing both regional distribution patterns and morphological characteristics of dipteran taxa. His research on *Tricholioproctia flavinervis* synonymy and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* in Taiwan highlights his role in clarifying taxonomic relationships and geographic ranges. Through these efforts, Shinonaga has left a lasting impact on the field of entomology, particularly in the systematic study of flies in East Asia and the Pacific. His publications remain foundational references for understanding the diversity and classification of these insects.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",25\n3978,XANTHOTRYXUS,\"\n\nXANTHOTRYXUS is a genus of flies that is distinct from the genus *Pollenia*, as noted in the provided text. It is characterized by species such as *X. mongol*, which exhibit a large body size, typically measuring 9–13 mm in length. Members of this genus are further distinguished by the presence of golden thoracic hairs, a notable feature that contributes to their taxonomic identification. Additionally, they possess specific morphological traits in their wings and legs, though the exact nature of these features is not detailed in the descriptions. The geographic distribution of *XANTHOTRYXUS* spans East Asia, with records from China, Japan, and South Korea. These regions likely represent the primary habitats for the genus, though further research may clarify whether their range extends beyond these areas. The combination of size, coloration, and structural characteristics positions *XANTHOTRYXUS* as a unique group within the fly family, separate from *Pollenia*.
