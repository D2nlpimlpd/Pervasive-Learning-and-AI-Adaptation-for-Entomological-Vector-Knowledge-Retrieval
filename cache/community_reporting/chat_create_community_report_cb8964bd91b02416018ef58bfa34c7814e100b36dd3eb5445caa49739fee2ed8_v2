His work primarily focused on the description of new species and genera within the Diptera order, particularly in the families Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae. HO described the genus *Hoa* in 1937, marking a significant taxonomic contribution. In 1934, he authored the species descriptions of *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*, *Sarcophaga flexuosa*, *Sarcophaga erecta*, and the Chinese *Musca autumnalis* (1393义乌亚麻蝇), the latter of which was also referenced in a 1938 illustration. The same year, he contributed to the illustration or description of *Musca domestica* (housefly) and *Stomoxys sitiens* (stable fly), though specific details about these works remain unclear.  \n\nIn 1936, HO described *Parasarcophaga hui* and the Chinese *Calliphora sinensis* (1399胡氏亚麻蝇), a species he is also credited with documenting in another source. Additionally, he is noted for describing the Red-headed Calliphora (*Calliphora vicina*), though the exact year for this work is unspecified. A 1938 study by HO on *Sarcorohdendorfia seniorwhitei* further highlights his expertise in sarcophagid flies.  \n\nHO’s research spanned both morphological and ecological studies, with a focus on species native to China. His 1934 work on *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata* and the 1932 description of *Parasarcophaga brevicornis* demonstrate his early engagement with parasarcophagid flies. The conflicting years for *Calliphora sinensis* (1934 vs. 1936) may reflect differing sources or a typographical error, but the 1936 reference is more explicitly tied to his authorship.  \n\nOverall, HO’s legacy includes foundational taxonomic work on multiple fly species, with a particular emphasis on the 1930s. His descriptions of *Hoa*, *Parasarcophaga hui*, *Sarcophaga flexuosa*, and *Sarcophaga erecta* remain key references in entomology, alongside his contributions to the understanding of *Musca autumnalis* and *Calliphora* species. The Chinese names 义乌亚麻蝇 and 胡氏亚麻蝇, associated with his 1934 and 1936 studies respectively, underscore his role in documenting regional biodiversity. HO’s work, though often cited in older literature, continues to provide critical baseline data for modern taxonomic and ecological research.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",17\n5291,义乌亚麻蝇,义乌亚麻蝇（Parasarcophaga (Curranea) iwuensis）是1934年由HO描述的亚麻蝇物种，雄性尾器特征包括阳茎膜状突末端圆，体长未明确，分布于中国江苏、浙江（模式产地）等省份及泰国,10\n5306,1399胡氏亚麻蝇,\"A species of fly described by Ho in 1936, with unique features like a 2x wider median frontal area and specialized genital structures.
