Their work spans several decades, with notable publications in journals such as *Acta Zoologica Sinica*, the *Journal of the Liaoning Zoological Society*, and *昆虫分类学报* (Journal of Insect Classification). XUE has described numerous species and subspecies, often collaborating with colleagues like Wang.  \n\nIn the genus *Mydaea*, XUE described the subspecies *Mydaea setifemur kongdinga* and the species *Mydaea tinctoscutaris*. For *Limnophora*, they authored descriptions of *Limnophora nigra*, *Limnophora nigrilineata*, *Limnophora purgata*, and *Limnophora fallax septentrionalis* (1984). Within *Helina*, XUE is credited with describing *Helina fica*, *Helina rariciliata*, *Helina subpubiseta* (1986), *Helina laticerca*, *Helina longiquadrata*, *Helina calathocerca*, *Helina graciliapica*, *Helina nudifemorata latiscissa* (as a subspecies), and co-authoring *Helina nigriannosa*. Additional *Helina* species attributed to XUE include *Helina biconiformis* and *Helina sublaxifrons*.  \n\nXUE’s most extensive work involves the genus *Phaonia*, where they described or co-described over 20 species. These include *Phaonia antennicrassa*, *Phaonia mimobitrigona*, *Phaonia septentrionalis*, *Phaonia aureipollinosa*, *Phaonia cothurnoloba*, *Phaonia guangdongensis*, *Phaonia brunneiabdomina*, *Phaonia dismagnicornis*, *Phaonia flavivivida*, *Phaonia pallatoides*, *Phaonia dawushanensis*, *Phaonia subvivida*, *Phaonia huanrenensis* (1984), *Phaonia qingheensis*, *Phaonia vagata*, *Phaonia jinbeiensis*, *Phaonia longifurca* (1984), *Phaonia shaanxiensis*, *Phaonia chuanierrans*, *Phaonia subnigrisquama*, and *Phaonia beizhenesis*. They also co-described the subspecies *Phaonia ezensis latifronta* (1984) and *Brontaea ezensis latifronta* (with Wang). XUE’s *Phaonia* descriptions frequently appear in *Acta Zoologica Sinica* and the *Journal of the Liaoning Zoological Society*.  \n\nIn the *Brontaea* genus, XUE described *Brontaea yunnanensis*, *Brontaea sichuanensis*, and co-authored *Brontaea genurufoidea* with Wang. They also described *Drymeia grapsopoda* in *昆虫分类学报* (1989) and *长白山点池蝇* (Changbaishan Dianchi Fly), a species linked to the Changbai Mountain region. Additionally, XUE co-described *亚棕翅阳蝇* (a species name in Chinese) in 1986.  \n\nBeyond taxonomy, XUE conducted a 1982 population fluctuation survey of *Bellardia nartshukae* in Liaoning, demonstrating their engagement in ecological studies. Their career highlights include pioneering work in the 1980s, with key publications in 1984 and 1989, and a focus on regional biodiversity in China, particularly in Liaoning, Guangdong, and Yunnan. XUE’s contributions are foundational to understanding the taxonomy of these fly genera, with many species and subspecies bearing their name as primary or co-author.

It is native to Liaoning, China, a region noted for its diverse fly fauna. \n\nKey morphological features of *Limnophora nigra* include a black abdominal spot, which is a distinguishing trait, and a body length of approximately 4 mm. The description emphasizes specific abdominal and anal plate structures, which are critical for taxonomic identification within the genus. These features align with the broader characteristics of *Limnophora* species, which are typically small flies with distinct color patterns and anatomical traits. \n\nThe species’ name, *nigra*, is derived from the Latin word for \"\"black,\"\" reflecting its dark coloration. While the first description highlights its overall black appearance and geographic origin, the second provides more precise taxonomic details, including the publication reference and measurements. Together, these accounts confirm *Limnophora nigra* as a well-defined species with a documented presence in Liaoning, China, and a morphology that includes a 4 mm body size, black abdominal markings, and unique anal plate features. \n\nNo contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they complement each other by combining taxonomic, morphological, and geographic data.
