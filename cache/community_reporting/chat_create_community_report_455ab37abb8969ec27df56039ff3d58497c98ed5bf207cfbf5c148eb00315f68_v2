It serves as the **type locality** for *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, meaning the species was first described and documented based on specimens collected there. Additionally, Moganshan is a **distribution area** for *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, indicating the species continues to inhabit or be observed in the region. The mountain is also associated with two other fly species, *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Isomyia furcicula*, which are part of its ecological or geographic context. These associations highlight Moganshan’s role as a biodiversity hotspot for specific insect taxa, particularly within the Diptera order. While the descriptions do not clarify whether *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Isomyia furcicula* are also type localities or merely present in the area, the confirmed status of *Pyrellia cyanicolor* as a type locality underscores the region’s importance in taxonomic research. Overall, Moganshan’s entomological significance lies in its connection to these species, contributing to scientific understanding of their habitats and distributions.
