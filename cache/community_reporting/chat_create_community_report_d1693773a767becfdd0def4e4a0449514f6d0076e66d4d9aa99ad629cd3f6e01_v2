It serves as a critical habitat for a diverse array of species, including the fly *Fannia scalaris*, which is distributed within this region. Additionally, the Afrotropical region is part of the international range of *Brontaea tonitrui*, a species found across multiple global locations. While the descriptions highlight the region’s role in the distribution of these two organisms, they align in emphasizing its significance as a biogeographic zone supporting unique biodiversity. The Afrotropical region’s ecosystems, ranging from tropical rainforests to savannas and deserts, contribute to the presence and adaptation of such species, underscoring its importance in ecological and taxonomic studies. The apparent contradiction in the second description—referring to *Brontaea tonitrui* as \"\"found internationally\"\"—is resolved by interpreting the Afrotropical region as one of several global habitats for the species, rather than its sole location.
