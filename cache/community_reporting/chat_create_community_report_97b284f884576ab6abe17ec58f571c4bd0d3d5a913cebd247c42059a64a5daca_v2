It serves as a domestic region within China where multiple genera and species of flies have been documented, including *Aplomyia*, *Bothria*, and *Zenillia*. Additionally, species such as *Lucilia shenyangensis*, *Sarcophila rasnitzyni*, *Exorista rossica*, *Protocalliphora azurea*, and *Rypellia* are known to inhabit the area. Specific species like 巨尾阿丽蝇 (likely *Chinecora* sp.) and 叉丽蝇 (possibly *Lucilia* sp.) are also part of Beijing’s ecological profile, as are 绯胫纹蝇 (a species with vestigial tibia characteristics) and 查禾短须寄蝇 (a parasitic fly species).  \n\nThe city has been identified as a site of parasitism events involving these flies, indicating its role in complex ecological interactions. Notably, 1461, 1462, 1463, and 1464 are species codes or identifiers associated with fly populations in Beijing, though their exact taxonomic classifications remain unspecified in the data. These findings highlight Beijing’s biodiversity and its importance in entomological research, particularly for understanding fly distribution patterns and parasitic behaviors in urban and surrounding environments.  \n\nAs a major metropolitan area, Beijing’s climate, geography, and human activity likely contribute to the presence and proliferation of these species. The coexistence of both native and potentially invasive fly genera underscores the city’s dynamic ecosystem. Researchers have cataloged this diversity to better comprehend ecological dynamics, public health implications, and conservation strategies in the region.  \n\nIn summary, Beijing, China, is a key hub for the distribution of numerous fly species, including both well-documented genera and specific Chinese-named species. Its status as the capital city, combined with documented parasitism events and a wide array of species, positions it as a critical area for studying fly ecology and related biological processes. The integration of English and Chinese nomenclature in the data reflects the collaborative nature of entomological research in the region.\",17\n5645,梁恩义,梁恩义 is a researcher who documented the parasitism of Calpe capucina Esper by 1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇 in Beijing.>,1\n2026,湖南,\"\n\nHunan is a province in China known for its diverse ecological habitats and the presence of several insect species. It serves as a domestic location for the parasitic flies *1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇* (likely *Paralucilia grisea* or a similar species) and *1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇* (possibly *Paralucilia abdominalis* or a related species), which are part of the family Tachinidae. The province is also a distribution area for *黑瓣莫蝇* (a Chinese name potentially corresponding to *Moricia nigripes* or a species in the genus *Moricia*), and it hosts the parasitic fly *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Isomyia oestracea*, both belonging to the genus *Isomyia*. Additionally, Hunan is associated with the species *松毛虫缅麻蝇* (likely *Paralucilia sp.* or a related parasitoid fly), which is linked to the pine caterpillar (*Dendrolimus* spp.), a common pest in forested regions. The province is home to *Helina sexmaculata*, a species in the genus *Helina* (family Sarcophagidae), and the moth *Prodenia litura* (commonly known as the armyworm or corn earworm, family Noctuidae). Notably, Hunan is also connected to the term \"\"Xinhui,\"\" though this may refer to a specific locality, research context, or misattribution, as Xinhui is a city in Guangdong Province. The data collectively highlight Hunan’s role as a significant region for entomological biodiversity, particularly for parasitic flies and lepidopteran species, which may have ecological or agricultural relevance due to their interactions with pests like the pine caterpillar. All species mentioned are native to China, with Hunan’s varied ecosystems supporting their habitats. The summary integrates both Chinese and English nomenclature where applicable, ensuring clarity while maintaining the original entity names for context.\",6\n2168,广西,\"\n\nGuangxi, a province in southern China, is a significant region for the distribution of various insect species. It is home to the species *Dichaetomyia bibax*, as well as 松毛虫缅麻蝇 (likely a Chinese name for a sarcophagid fly species). The province also hosts *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa*, with a specific record of its presence in Guilin, a city in Guangxi. Additionally, Guangxi serves as a domestic location for two closely related species, 1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇 and 1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇, both of which are parasitic flies. The region is further noted for the distribution of 峨眉亚麻蝇 (a species of tachinid fly) and 绯颜翠蝇 (*Neomyia (Orthellia) rufifacies*), the latter of which has Dongxing in Guangxi as its type locality. \n\nGuangxi’s biodiversity includes the presence of *Musca chui* and *Musca vitripennis*, two species of houseflies, and 曲股欧麻蝇 (a species of muscid fly). These records highlight Guangxi’s ecological importance as a habitat for both common and specialized fly species, including parasitic and predatory forms. The province’s varied environments, such as the Guilin area and Dongxing, contribute to the localized distribution of certain species. While the descriptions focus on entomological data, they collectively underscore Guangxi’s role in the broader context of China’s insect fauna, particularly for Diptera (true flies) and their ecological niches.
