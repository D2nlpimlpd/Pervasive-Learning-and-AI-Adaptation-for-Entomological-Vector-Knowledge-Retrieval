It is the site where the holotype of *Mydaea latielecta* was collected, a species of interest in scientific studies. Additionally, Zhanjiang is associated with the collection of *Mydaea breviscutellata*, another species documented in the region. The city also serves as a specific location for *Hebecnema fumosa*, a species native to Guangdong, further underscoring its role in biodiversity research. Zhanjiang is part of the distribution range for *Zongquan Yangying*, a species whose presence in the area contributes to regional ecological data. Notably, the city was the focus of a 1988 study conducted by Xiao Chuanji, which likely advanced understanding of its local fauna or environmental characteristics. These associations highlight Zhanjiang’s importance as a hub for scientific exploration, particularly in the study of insect species and their habitats.
