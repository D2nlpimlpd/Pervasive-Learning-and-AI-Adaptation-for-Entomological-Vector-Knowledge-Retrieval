It is the home of **Phaonia mimobasiseta** and **Phaonia fuscitibia**, two species within the genus *Phaonia* (family Muscidae), which are distributed across its territory. These species contribute to the province’s entomological diversity and may play roles in local ecosystems, such as decomposition or pollination, though specific ecological functions are not detailed in the provided data.  \n\nAdditionally, JILIN PROVINCE holds a unique distinction as the **northernmost known location for the Xenotachina genus** in China. The Xenotachina genus, also part of the family Muscidae, is typically associated with more temperate or subtropical regions, making its presence in Jilin noteworthy for biogeographical studies. This highlights the province’s position as a transitional or marginal habitat for certain fly species, potentially influenced by its cold-temperate climate and seasonal variations.  \n\nThe combination of these two points underscores Jilin’s role as a region of interest for researchers studying the distribution patterns of dipteran insects. The coexistence of *Phaonia* species and the northernmost occurrence of *Xenotachina* suggest that the province’s environmental conditions, such as its forests, wetlands, or agricultural areas, may support a range of ecological niches for these flies. However, the data does not clarify whether these species interact or if their habitats overlap within the province.  \n\nNo contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they reference distinct genera (*Phaonia* and *Xenotachina*) and their respective distributions. Together, they emphasize Jilin Province’s contribution to the broader understanding of insect biodiversity in northern China, particularly in documenting the geographic limits of certain genera. Further studies could explore the ecological factors enabling these distributions and their implications for regional conservation efforts.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",3\n3474,PHANOIA MIMOBASISETA,,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n6314,HEILONGJIANG PROVINCE,PHANOIA FUSCITIBIA,Species is distributed in Heilongjiang Province,12\n2738,JILIN PROVINCE,ANN.
