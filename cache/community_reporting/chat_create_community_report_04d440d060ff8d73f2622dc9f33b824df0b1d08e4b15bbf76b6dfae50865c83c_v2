It is home to multiple species of the genus *Dichaetomyia*, as well as *松毛虫缅麻蝇* (Dichotomius sp.) and *盘突缅麻蝇* (Dichotomius sp.), which are documented within its ecological range. The province supports the presence of blowflies such as *Lucilia sinensis* and *Lucilia shenyangensis*, along with green bottle flies like *长叶绿蝇* (Lucilia longifolia) and *毛腹绿蝇* (Lucilia pilosa). Additionally, Sichuan hosts species of the genus *Isomyia*, including *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Isomyia oestracea*, as well as *Protocalliphora azurea*, a species of bot fly.  \n\nThe region is also notable for its role in the domestic distribution of other genera and species. For example, *Agria xiangchengensis*, *Helina nemorum*, and *宽角阳蝇* (Helina laticornis) are all recorded in Sichuan. The province serves as a key habitat for *Xenotachina* species and *Onesia* species, further highlighting its biodiversity. Specific type localities are associated with Sichuan, such as *长腹鬃粪蝇* (Sepsis longabdominalis), whose type locality is Jiulao Cave on Mount Emei, and *渡口白麻蝇* (Dialyta halterata), which is linked to the province as its type locality.  \n\nSichuan’s ecological diversity extends to parasitic and myiasis-related species. It is a documented distribution area for *1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇* (Chrysomya sinensis), *1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇* (Chrysomya abdominalis), and *1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇* (Chrysomya sumatrensis), as well as *牛皮蝇* (Hypoderma bovis), a species known for causing bovine myiasis. The province is also associated with the *酸棘蝇群* (Acridophaga species group) and the *盘叶泉种蝇* (Delia pannonicola) and *峨泽菊泉种蝇* (Delia oryzae), both of which are found in its agricultural or ecological zones.  \n\nFurther, Sichuan is a documented location for *Sinohylemya craspedodonta* and *Phorbia hypandrium*, and it supports the presence of *Pyrellia cyanicolor* and *Delia echinata*. The genus *Rypellia* is recorded in Huili, the type locality for *Rypellia huiliensis* (Ni), as well as other areas within the province. *峨眉亚麻蝇* (Rypellia emeiana) and *肥须亚麻蝇* (Rypellia crassicornis) are specifically noted as distributed in Sichuan.  \n\nIn summary, Sichuan Province is a critical hub for the domestic and regional distribution of a wide array of insect species, including blowflies, green bottle flies, parasitic flies, and others. Its role as a type locality for certain species, such as *长腹鬃粪蝇* and *渡口白麻蝇*, underscores its importance in entomological research. The province’s varied ecosystems, from mountainous regions like Mount Emei to agricultural landscapes, contribute to the presence of these species, making it a focal area for studying insect biodiversity in China.\",36\n4604,乡城野蝇,,2\n3852,红原蚓蝇,Onesia hongyuanensis is a species of earthworm fly described by Chen et Fan in 1991 with 1 post-ventral tibial bristle,1\n4851,渡口,中国四川省的地点，渡口白麻蝇的模式产地。,1\n4850,POДEHДOPΦ,PoдeHдopΦ 是提供斑麻蝇属生态习性及分类信息的学者（1937年、1959年）。,2\n978,菠茎地种蝇,\"菠茎地种蝇Delia echinata (Seguy, 1923) is a species of fly described in Ann, Soc, Ent.France, 91: 360(Chortophila).

It serves as a non-native habitat for *Delia lineariventris* and *Delia echinata*, both of which are part of the genus *Delia*, which is generally distributed in North America. Similarly, 冕形泉种蝇 (likely *Delia coronata* or a related species) is also noted to have North America as a foreign distribution region. The genus *Delia* itself is described as being present in North America, though the term \"\"foreign distribution\"\" for specific species suggests these may have been introduced or are not native to the region.  \n\nAdditionally, North America is the native range for *Eutrichota labradorensis*, a species with Labrador as its type locality, indicating its specific association with the region. The data also highlights that the 斑麻蝇属 (genus *Delia*), which includes species like *Delia lineariventris* and *Delia echinata*, exhibits parasitic ecological habits, particularly targeting grasshoppers. This aligns with the broader context of *Delia* species being distributed in North America, either as native or introduced populations.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize North America’s role as both a native and foreign distribution zone for different organisms. While *Eutrichota labradorensis* is indigenous to the region, the genus *Delia* and its species are described as having foreign or non-native distributions there, likely due to historical or ecological factors. The parasitic behavior of *Delia* species, such as preying on grasshoppers, further contextualizes their ecological impact in North America. The term \"\"foreign distribution location/region\"\" appears to resolve contradictions by distinguishing between native and introduced species within the same genus. Overall, North America is portrayed as a geographically and ecologically significant area for these taxa, with varying degrees of naturalization and biological interactions.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",9\n3850,巴塘蚓蝇,Onesia batangensis is a species of earthworm fly described by Chen et Fan in 1991 with brown armpits,7\n3849,松潘蚓蝇,Onesia songpanensis is a species of earthworm fly described by Chen et Fan in 1992 with 2+3 median bristles,6\n3848,阿坝蚓蝇,Onesia abaensis is a species of earthworm fly described by Chen et Fan in 1992 with black anterior bristles,4\n4857,股斑麻蝇,股斑麻蝇 (Sarcotachinella sinuata) 是斑麻蝇属的物种，形态特征包括中股前部有白色纤毛斑，体长4-9毫米。其生态习性包括在北美寄生赤腿蜢的若虫和成虫。,2\n979,\"ANN, SOC, ENT.FRANCE\",\"Ann, Soc, Ent.France is a journal where the species Delia echinata was described\",1\n980,墨脱,\"\n\n**墨脱 (Mudan)** is a county located in the southeastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region, China. It is renowned for its unique geographical and ecological significance, particularly as a habitat for specific fly species. The area is associated with **Isomyia pseudolucilia**, a species within the genus *Isomyia*, which is part of the blow fly family (Calliphoridae). This connection highlights 墨脱's role in biodiversity studies, as such species are often indicators of environmental conditions or forensic interest. Additionally, 墨脱 is home to **Delia echinata**, a member of the Delia genus in the fly family Anthomyiidae, which is typically linked to agricultural or ecological research due to its interactions with plants.  \n\nAs a remote and ecologically diverse region, 墨脱 is situated near the border with India and Nepal, within the Himalayan foothills. Its high-altitude terrain and subtropical climate create a distinct ecosystem that supports a range of flora and fauna, including these notable fly species. The presence of both *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Delia echinata* in 墨脱 underscores the area’s importance for entomological studies, offering insights into species distribution and adaptation in challenging environments.  \n\nThe county has also been historically significant for its inaccessibility, as it was once one of the last regions in China to be connected by a road, completed in 2013. This isolation may have contributed to the preservation of its unique ecological characteristics, including the habitats of these fly species. While the descriptions provided focus on entomological associations, 墨脱’s broader context as a culturally and geographically distinct part of Tibet further enriches its profile as a site of scientific and geographical interest.  \n\nIn summary, 墨脱 (Mudan) is a Tibetan county notable for its ecological niche, supporting both *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Delia echinata*, and for its strategic location in the Himalayas. Its combination of biodiversity and historical significance makes it a key area for research and conservation efforts.\",1\n981,汉源,\"Hanyuan is a city in Sichuan, China, where Delia echinata is found\",1\n982,雅安地区防疫站,Ya'an region's epidemic prevention station is a domestic distribution location for Delia echinata,1\n983,萨哈林岛,Sakhalin Island is a foreign distribution location for Delia echinata,1\n985,巴黎,Paris is the type locality for Delia echinata,1\n4848,TRANS.AMER.ENT.SOC.,Trans.Amer.ent.Soc. 是美国昆虫学会的学术期刊，发表了斑麻蝇属的原始描述文献（第19卷110页）。,1\n3860,巴塘,Batang in Sichuan is the type locality for Onesia batangensis,1\n3862,中甸,Zhongdian in Yunnan is a distribution site for Onesia batangensis,1\n3246,巨角棘蝇群,巨角棘蝇群的特征是体被淡色粉被；芒毳毛状；后背中鬃3；触角第三节稍长；与光泽棘蝇群和猬棘蝇群相似，不同的是翅前鬃粗壮，几乎与前背侧片鬃等长；平衡棒黄色。,4\n3251,古北区,\"\n\n古北区（Palaearctic Region）是全球生物地理学中划分的七大动物地理区之一，主要分布于北半球，涵盖欧洲、亚洲北部以及北美洲的部分地区。这一区域以温带和寒带气候为主，其生态系统多样性显著，包括广阔的森林、草原、苔原和高山环境，为众多特有物种提供了栖息地。古北区的物种分布特征与其地理位置和历史演化密切相关，例如冰川期的气候变化对区域内生物的迁移与分化产生了深远影响。该区域不仅包含丰富的陆生动物群，还与邻近的东洋区（Oriental Region）和非洲区（Afrotropical Region）在生态边界上存在过渡性联系。古北区的生物多样性研究对于理解全球物种演化模式及保护策略具有重要意义，其范围内的自然保护区和生态走廊建设常被纳入国际生物多样性保护框架。此外，古北区的名称源于古北界（Palaearctic Realm），这一术语在生物地理学中特指其独特的生态与物种组成。\",3\n3857,松潘,Songpan in Sichuan is a distribution site for Onesia songpanensis,1\n3858,红原,Hongyuan in Sichuan is a distribution site for Onesia hongyuanensis,1\n3856,若尔盖,Ruoergai in Sichuan is the type locality for Onesia abaensis and Onesia songpanensis,2\n3243,黄棘蝇群,黄棘蝇群的特征是体躯显然较黄；大多数有前中鬃。与游荡棘蝇的区别也在于显然呈黄色。其中Ph.rufiventris的幼虫取食腐蕈。,2\n3247,林棘蝇群,林棘蝇群的特征是足总是黑色的，小盾也总是黑的，口上片突出，前中鬃发达（Ph.kobica Schnabl 除外）；后背中鬃3；为北半球森林高山类群。,2\n1691,雅安周公山,\"Ya'an Zhougong Mountain in Sichuan Province, China, the type locality for 狭颊客夜蝇.\",1\n3244,光泽棘蝇群,光泽棘蝇群与猬棘蝇群很近似，主要特征是后气门稍大；后背侧片鬃长，前胸基腹片、下侧片和背侧片裸（Ph.wahlbergi Ringdahl 除外）。,2\n3248,酸棘蝇群,酸棘蝇群与栉胫棘蝇群很相似，但口上片突出；后背中鬃4；♂额狭。,3\n3262,栉胫棘蝇群,,1\n3252,喜马拉雅山系,横跨缅甸、印度和中国四川的喜马拉雅山脉区域。,1\n3861,乡城,\"\n\nXiangcheng (乡城) is a location in Sichuan Province, China, recognized for its ecological and taxonomic significance in botanical studies. It serves as the **type locality** for *Agria xiangchengensis*, a species named after the region, indicating that this plant was first identified and described based on specimens collected from Xiangcheng. Additionally, Xiangcheng is a **distribution site** for *Onesia batangensis*, a species native to the Batang area but also found in this locality, highlighting its role in the broader geographic range of the plant. \n\nThe presence of these two species in Xiangcheng underscores the region’s biodiversity and its importance as a hub for scientific research. *Agria xiangchengensis*, specifically, is tied to the area through its nomenclature, which reflects the locality’s contribution to its discovery and classification. Meanwhile, *Onesia batangensis* demonstrates that Xiangcheng is part of a larger ecological network, as the species extends beyond its namesake Batang region to thrive in Sichuan. Both references emphasize Xiangcheng’s value as a site for studying plant distribution and endemism in the Sichuan biodiversity hotspot. \n\nNo contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they pertain to distinct species with separate taxonomic contexts. The summary integrates all provided information to present Xiangcheng as a key location in Sichuan for both the origin of *Agria xiangchengensis* and the presence of *Onesia batangensis*. This synthesis ensures clarity about the entity’s role in botanical science while maintaining a concise and coherent narrative. \n\n(Word count: 150)\",2\n3245,猬棘蝇群,猬棘蝇群与光泽棘蝇群近缘，♂额很宽，具2个上眶鬃一如♀性，后背中鬃3；后胫具端位后腹鬃，芒几乎裸；翅前鬃退化。,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2745,狭颊客夜蝇XENOTACHINA ANGUSTIGENA,FAN,Fan described the species 狭颊客夜蝇 as a new species,298\n3152,横断山区昆虫,SICHUAN,横断山区昆虫 documents the distribution of Drymeia cinerascens in Sichuan,190\n9134,斑麻蝇属,TOWNSEND,Townsend 于1892年建立了斑麻蝇属,68\n1739,四川,盘叶泉种蝇,盘叶泉种蝇分布于四川,40\n8719,四川,乡城野蝇,The species *Agria xiangchengensis* is distributed in Sichuan,38\n7211,红原蚓蝇,四川,Onesia hongyuanensis is distributed in Sichuan,37\n9148,四川,渡口,渡口是四川省的地点,37\n9146,POДEHДOPΦ,苏联,PoдeHдopΦ 的研究涉及苏联地区的斑麻蝇属生态,36\n1208,菠茎地种蝇,SEGUIY,Seguy described the species Delia echinata,32\n6615,中国常见蝇类检索表（初版）,浙江,The publication lists Zhejiang as a distribution location for multiple fly species,23\n1195,北美,菠茎地种蝇,Delia echinata is distributed in North America,21\n7198,巴塘蚓蝇,CHEN ET FAN,Chen and Fan described Onesia batangensis in 1991,17\n7192,松潘蚓蝇,CHEN ET FAN,Chen and Fan described Onesia songpanensis in 1992,16\n7188,阿坝蚓蝇,CHEN ET FAN,Chen and Fan described Onesia abaensis in 1992,14\n9137,斑麻蝇属,股斑麻蝇,股斑麻蝇是斑麻蝇属的物种,14\n1209,菠茎地种蝇,\"ANN, SOC, ENT.FRANCE\",\"Ann, Soc, Ent.France published the description of Delia echinata\",13\n1211,菠茎地种蝇,墨脱,\"Delia echinata is found in Mudan, Tibet\",13\n1213,菠茎地种蝇,汉源,\"Delia echinata is found in Hanyuan, Sichuan\",13\n1214,菠茎地种蝇,雅安地区防疫站,Delia echinata is found in Ya'an region's epidemic prevention station,13\n1215,菠茎地种蝇,萨哈林岛,Delia echinata is distributed in Sakhalin Island,13\n1217,菠茎地种蝇,巴黎,Paris is the type locality for Delia echinata,13\n9135,斑麻蝇属,TRANS.AMER.ENT.SOC.,Trans.Amer.ent.Soc.发表了斑麻蝇属的原始描述,13\n7201,巴塘蚓蝇,巴塘,Batang is the type locality for Onesia batangensis,8\n7204,巴塘蚓蝇,中甸,Zhongdian is a distribution site for Onesia batangensis,8\n5870,巨角棘蝇群,古北区,巨角棘蝇群的物种分布于古北区,7\n7195,松潘蚓蝇,松潘,Songpan is a distribution site for Onesia songpanensis,7\n7196,松潘蚓蝇,红原,Hongyuan is a distribution site for Onesia songpanensis,7\n7191,阿坝蚓蝇,若尔盖,Ruoergai is the type locality for Onesia abaensis,6\n5868,黄棘蝇群,古北区,黄棘蝇群的多个物种分布于古北区,5\n5874,林棘蝇群,古北区,林棘蝇群的物种分布于古北区,5\n2747,狭颊客夜蝇XENOTACHINA ANGUSTIGENA,雅安周公山,\"The species is found in Ya'an Zhougong Mountain, Sichuan\",4\n5867,黄棘蝇群,光泽棘蝇群,黄棘蝇群与光泽棘蝇群在形态上近似，但体躯更黄且前中鬃更发达,4\n5876,酸棘蝇群,栉胫棘蝇群,酸棘蝇群与栉胫棘蝇群形态相似，但口上片突出且后背中鬃数量不同,4\n5877,酸棘蝇群,喜马拉雅山系,酸棘蝇群的物种分布于喜马拉雅山系的缅甸、印度和中国四川,4\n8720,乡城,乡城野蝇,The species *Agria xiangchengensis* originates from Xiangcheng (mode locality),4\n5869,光泽棘蝇群,猬棘蝇群,光泽棘蝇群与猬棘蝇群近缘，但♂额宽度和鬃毛特征存在差异,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
