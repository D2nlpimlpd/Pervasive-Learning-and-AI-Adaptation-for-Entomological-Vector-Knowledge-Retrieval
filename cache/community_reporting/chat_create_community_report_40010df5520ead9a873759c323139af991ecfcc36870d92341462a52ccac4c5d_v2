It is distributed in Shanghai, China, and Tokyo, Japan (type locality).\",3\n1529,TOKYO,\"\n\n**TOKYO** is a major city in Japan, recognized as a significant location in entomological studies and species distribution records. It is associated with the species *Achoetandrus rufifacies*, which was documented in a 1958 study by Gan, highlighting its ecological or taxonomic relevance to the region. Additionally, Tokyo is part of the distribution range for *Musca conducens*, a species of fly, further underscoring its role in biodiversity research. The city also serves as the type locality for *黄跗粪泉蝇* (likely *Musca rufifacies* or a related species, based on the Chinese name), indicating that the species was first formally described using specimens collected there.  \n\nOne description erroneously states that Tokyo is a city in Vietnam; this is incorrect, as Tokyo is unequivocally located in Japan. Another entry references the \"\"Ryukyu Islands\"\" (琉球群岛), a region in southern Japan that includes Okinawa and surrounding islands. While the Ryukyu Islands are a distinct geographical area within Japan, they are not directly part of Tokyo. However, the inclusion of this phrase in the data may imply broader regional connections or studies involving Japanese locations, including Tokyo.  \n\nIn summary, Tokyo, Japan, is a key urban center with documented ties to multiple entomological species and historical research. Its association with *Achoetandrus rufifacies* (1958 study), *Musca conducens*, and the type locality for *黄跗粪泉蝇* reflects its importance in scientific observations of insect populations. The contradictory mention of Vietnam is resolved by confirming Tokyo’s correct national affiliation, while the reference to the Ryukyu Islands is contextualized as a separate Japanese region. These details collectively position Tokyo as a focal point for understanding species dynamics in Japan.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2402,黄跗粪泉蝇,SUWA,Suwa described 黄跗粪泉蝇 in 1974,38\n2404,黄跗粪泉蝇,TOKYO,\"黄跗粪泉蝇 is distributed in Tokyo, Japan (type locality)\",4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
