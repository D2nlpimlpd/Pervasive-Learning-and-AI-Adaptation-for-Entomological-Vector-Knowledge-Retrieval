It is characterized by a combination of distinct morphological traits that distinguish it from related taxa. Notably, members of *Parasarcophaga* lack abdominal median bristles, a feature critical to their taxonomic identification. The male face is approximately twice the width of the eye, contributing to their unique appearance. Genitalia morphology is a key diagnostic feature: the genus is defined by non-developed ventral processes in males, while subgenera within *Parasarcophaga* are further differentiated by variations in the development of lateral and central processes on the male genitalia. These structural differences in genitalia are essential for classifying the diverse subgenera under this taxonomic group.  \n\nThe genus exhibits complex morphological characteristics, reflecting its evolutionary diversity and adaptability. Its broad geographic distribution underscores its ecological prevalence, though specific regional details are not provided in the descriptions. The taxonomic history of *Parasarcophaga* highlights a shift from its initial classification as a subgenus to its current status as a distinct genus, likely due to advancements in morphological analysis and phylogenetic studies. This reclassification emphasizes the importance of genitalia structures and other unique traits in defining its evolutionary lineage.  \n\nIn summary, *Parasarcophaga* is a well-defined genus of flies with a notable absence of abdominal median bristles, a male face twice the eye width, and genitalia structures marked by non-developed ventral processes. Subgenera within the genus are distinguished by the development of lateral and central processes, underscoring the role of genitalia morphology in taxonomic differentiation. Originally described as a subgenus in 1921, its elevated status as a genus reflects its distinct evolutionary and morphological identity. The genus is widely distributed, though further research may clarify its specific habitats and ecological roles. This synthesis integrates the provided descriptions, resolving the taxonomic ambiguity by acknowledging its original subgenus classification while affirming its current genus-level recognition.

It serves as the **type locality** for the subgenus *Parasarcophaga*, a taxonomic classification within the genus *Sarcophaga* (commonly known as flesh flies), indicating that the subgenus was first formally described based on specimens collected from this region. This designation highlights Maerkang's role in entomological research as a reference point for the subgenus's origin and characteristics.  \n\nAdditionally, Maerkang is associated with the **distribution of *Xanthotryxus* species**, a genus of organisms (likely insects or arachnids, though the exact classification is unspecified in the provided data). This suggests that the area is ecologically or geographically relevant to the presence, habitat, or study of these species, potentially contributing to regional biodiversity records or scientific investigations into their taxonomy and ecology.  \n\nWhile the two descriptions focus on distinct biological groups—*Parasarcophaga* (a subgenus of flies) and *Xanthotryxus* (a genus of unspecified organisms)—they both underscore Maerkang's importance in Sichuan as a site of taxonomic and ecological interest. The lack of direct contradiction between the two points allows for a unified summary, emphasizing the location's dual relevance in entomology and broader biological studies. Maerkang’s role as a type locality for *Parasarcophaga* and its connection to *Xanthotryxus* species distribution collectively position it as a key area for understanding the biodiversity and evolutionary history of its associated taxa.
