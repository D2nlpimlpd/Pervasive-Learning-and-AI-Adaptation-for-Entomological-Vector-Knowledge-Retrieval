The entity is credited as the original describer of *Graphomya maculata* and *Sarcophaga variegata*, both of which were formally documented in the same year. These contributions are significant in the field of entomology, as they represent early taxonomic work on flies. *Graphomya maculata*, a species within the family Syrphidae (hoverflies), and *Sarcophaga variegata*, a member of the family Sarcophagidae (flesh flies), were each introduced to scientific literature by SCOPOLI, establishing their binomial nomenclature. While the descriptions provided do not clarify SCOPOLI’s full identity or broader scientific contributions, the repeated mention of 1763 as the year for both species suggests a single individual responsible for their classification. The lack of conflicting information in the data allows for a unified summary, emphasizing SCOPOLI’s role in documenting these two distinct species during the 18th century. Further historical context would be needed to determine if SCOPOLI refers to a specific person, such as the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, who was active in the same period and known for his work in natural history. However, based solely on the provided data, SCOPOLI is definitively linked to the 1763 descriptions of *Graphomya maculata* and *Sarcophaga variegata*.\",2\n5138,NORTHERN MONGOLIA,A region where Sarcophaga variegata is distributed,1\n5139,FORMER SOVIET UNION,A country where Sarcophaga variegata is found,1\n2279,JINGHE,\"\n\nJINGHE is a county located in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China, recognized as a significant geographical and ecological site associated with the distribution and presence of several notable species.
