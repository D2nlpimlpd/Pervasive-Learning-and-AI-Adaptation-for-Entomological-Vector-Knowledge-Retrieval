It is characterized by a body length ranging between 6.0–7.5 mm, with some sources specifying a more precise range of 6.5–7.5 mm and others noting a typical length of 6 mm. The species exhibits distinct morphological features, including specific bristle patterns that aid in its identification. Geographically, Leucophora sericea is distributed across several regions: domestically in China, it has been recorded in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Hebei, and Qinghai. Internationally, its range extends to Japan and France, the latter of which is noted as the type locality—the original location where the species was first described. The combination of its bristle patterns and body size measurements provides key diagnostic traits for distinguishing it from related species within the genus *Leucophora*. Despite minor discrepancies in reported body lengths, the consensus places it within the 6–7.5 mm range, reflecting natural variation or potential differences in measurement methods. This species is part of the broader ecological and taxonomic context of flies, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitats.\",7\n1317,CALYTHEA NIGRICANS,\"\n\n**Calythea nigricans** is a species of fly belonging to the family Anthomyiidae, which includes root flies rather than flower flies. It was first described by the entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830, though an earlier source erroneously attributes its description to \"\"R.-D.\"\" in 1825. The species is characterized by a distinct morphological feature in males: a single row of lower orbital bristles, and adults typically measure 3.5 mm in body length. \n\nLarvae of *Calythea nigricans* are known to breed in the dung of domestic animals, specifically pigs and cows, as noted in the first description. This ecological trait aligns with the general habits of Anthomyiidae, which often utilize decaying organic matter for larval development. \n\nIn terms of distribution, *Calythea nigricans* is found in several regions. Domestically, it occurs in China, with records from the cities of Beijing, Sichuan, and Shanghai. Internationally, its range extends to Southwest Asia, Europe (including France), North Africa, and both North and South America. This broad geographic presence suggests the species is well-adapted to temperate and subtropical climates, though specific ecological preferences or host associations beyond dung-breeding remain unmentioned in the provided data. \n\nThe discrepancy in the description’s authorship and year (1825 vs. 1830) has been resolved by prioritizing the full name \"\"Robineau-Desvoidy\"\" and the later, more precise date of 1830, which is consistent with historical taxonomic records. The family classification as Anthomyiidae is retained, as the initial reference to \"\"flower fly\"\" appears to be an error, given that flower flies belong to the family Syrphidae. \n\nIn summary, *Calythea nigricans* is a small, bristle-marked root fly with a global distribution spanning multiple continents and a larval ecology tied to livestock dung. Its taxonomic history and morphological traits highlight its role within the Anthomyiidae family, while its widespread occurrence underscores its adaptability to diverse environments.\",6\n636,FRANCE,\"\n\nFrance, a European country, is associated with the distribution and type localities of numerous insect species. It serves as the type locality for *Metopia staegeri*, *Macronychia striginervis*, *Macronychia polyodon*, *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (a species likely related to flies, given the context), *Limnophora nigripes*, *Helina intermedia*, *Hydrotaea velutina*, *Leucophora cinerea*, *Leucophora sericea*, *Robineauella scoparia*, *Phaonia incana*, and *Egle parva*. These designations indicate that France is the geographical origin where these species were first formally described. Additionally, France is part of the distribution range for *1396犁头亚麻蝇*, *Helina lasiophthalma*, *Helina punctifemoralis*, *Egle anthomyioides*, *Calythea nigricans*, *Haematobia titillans*, *Musca larvipara*, *Parasarcophaga uliginosa*, and *Delia floricola*. The country is also linked to the genus *Helicophagella* as a site of its distribution. Notably, France is explicitly described as a \"\"foreign country\"\" in one entry, though this likely reflects a contextual distinction rather than a contradiction, as it is geographically part of Europe. The data collectively highlight France’s role as both a biodiversity hotspot and a critical reference point for taxonomic studies of these species, spanning multiple genera and families. Its significance as a type locality underscores its contribution to entomological science, while its inclusion in distribution records emphasizes its ecological relevance to these insects. The species listed range from flies (*Musca*, *Haematobia*) to other dipterans (*Helina*, *Leucophora*), reflecting France’s diverse habitats and their support for varied insect life. The repeated emphasis on type localities and distribution aligns with France’s prominence in scientific documentation, though the specific ecological interactions or habitats of these species within the country are not detailed in the provided data. Overall, France emerges as a key location in the study and classification of these insect species, with both historical and contemporary biological importance.\",18\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4878,LIMNOPHORA NIGRIPES,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described the species *Limnophora nigripes* in 1830,121\n1420,LEUCOPHORA SERICEA,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,\"\n\nLeucophora sericea is a species first described by the entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830.
