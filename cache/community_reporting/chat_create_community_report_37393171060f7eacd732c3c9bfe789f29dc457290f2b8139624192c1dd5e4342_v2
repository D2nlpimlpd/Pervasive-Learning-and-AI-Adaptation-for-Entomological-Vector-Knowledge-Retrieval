It serves as the type locality for two species of flies within the genus *Drymeia*: *Drymeia hirsutitibia* and *Drymeia stenoperistoma*. A type locality is the specific site where a species is first identified, described, and formally named, making Wolong Balang Mountain a critical reference point for these taxa. The mountain’s role in the classification of these species highlights its ecological and scientific importance, particularly in the study of biodiversity and evolutionary relationships among flies. While the descriptions provided do not specify additional details about the mountain’s physical characteristics, elevation, or broader ecological context, its designation as the type locality for both species underscores its relevance in taxonomic research. The presence of these two *Drymeia* species in the same region suggests that Wolong Balang Mountain may harbor a diverse or specialized ecosystem conducive to the development of unique arthropod fauna. Further studies or publications about the area could expand on its environmental features, but based on the available data, its primary significance lies in its association with the formal documentation of *Drymeia hirsutitibia* and *Drymeia stenoperistoma*. The mountain is likely part of the Wolong Nature Reserve, a well-known protected area in Sichuan renowned for its conservation efforts and rich biodiversity, though this connection is inferred and not explicitly stated in the provided descriptions. Overall, Wolong Balang Mountain is a key site in the taxonomic history of these two fly species, contributing to the understanding of their distribution and biological traits. Its role as a type locality ensures its recognition in scientific literature related to *Drymeia* taxonomy.
