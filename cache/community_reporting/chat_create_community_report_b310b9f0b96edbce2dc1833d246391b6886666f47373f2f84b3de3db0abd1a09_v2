The report specifically identified the larvae of *Protophormia terraenovae* (棕尾别麻蝇), a species of blow fly, as the causative agents of an intestinal infestation known as enteromyiasis. This condition, characterized by the presence of fly larvae in the gastrointestinal tract, was observed in sailors, likely due to exposure to unsanitary conditions or contaminated food sources during their voyages. Eysell’s work highlighted the medical and public health implications of such infestations, particularly in maritime populations where close quarters and limited hygiene could exacerbate the risk of parasitic infections. The 1915 case study remains a notable example in the historical understanding of myiasis, emphasizing the role of environmental factors and the importance of preventive measures in tropical or resource-limited settings. By linking the larvae to *Protophormia terraenovae*, Eysell contributed to the taxonomic identification of the species responsible for this rare but severe form of myiasis, advancing entomological and medical knowledge of the time. The report is cited as an early record of human infestation by this particular fly species, underscoring the intersection of parasitology, entomology, and occupational health in the early 20th century.\",3\n5158,CHINESE SAILORS,Group of sailors in China affected by larvae in 1913,1\n5159,1915 REPORT ON MYIASIS,Event where Eysell documented larvae causing myiasis in Chinese sailors,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9724,BOETTCHERISCA PEREGRINA,QINGDAO 1913 EVENT,棕尾别麻蝇幼虫导致 1913 年青岛水兵肠蛆症事件,32\n9728,EYSELL,QINGDAO 1913 EVENT,Eysell 报告了 1913 年青岛的肠蛆症事件,6\n9738,EYSELL,CHINESE SAILORS,Reported on larvae causing myiasis in Chinese sailors,4\n9739,EYSELL,1915 REPORT ON MYIASIS,Authored the 1915 myiasis report,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
