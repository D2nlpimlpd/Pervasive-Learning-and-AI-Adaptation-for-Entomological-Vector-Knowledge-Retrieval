As one of Japan’s four main islands, Shikoku is also a sub-region within the country, contributing to its dual classification as both a geographical landmass and a regional administrative division. The island is home to diverse fly species, including the **Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes**, a notable insect associated with its unique ecosystems. Additionally, **Tainanina species** are distributed across Shikoku, further highlighting its biodiversity. The region supports the **Pegoplata virginea**, a species linked to its environmental conditions, and the **Yellow-Legged Naked Variant Beauty Fly (Gymnadichosia pusilla)**, which is explicitly found there. Shikoku also hosts the **Strongyloneura senomera**, another species documented in its habitats. The **Paradichosia scutellata** is similarly reported to inhabit the region, underscoring Shikoku’s role in supporting rare or specialized fly populations. Furthermore, the **Fucellia apicalis** is specifically noted as being found in Shikoku, while the **Chiastocheta species** and **Megophyra species** are associated with its sub-regional ecosystems. These species collectively reflect Shikoku’s ecological importance as a habitat for both endemic and regionally distributed insects. The descriptions consistently identify Shikoku as an island and region in Japan, with no contradictions in its geographical classification.
