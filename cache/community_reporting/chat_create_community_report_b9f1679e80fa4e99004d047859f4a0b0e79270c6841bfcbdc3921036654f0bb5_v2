In 1906, Czerny described the species *Strobilomyia anthracinum*, which is one of the key contributions attributed to him. The same year, he was also linked to the species *Chortophila anthracina*, though the exact nature of his involvement (e.g., description, classification, or study) is not explicitly clarified in the provided data. Additionally, Czerny is credited as the author of *Pegohylemyia sanctimarci*, originally described in the journal *Wiener Entomologische Zeitung* (Wien. Ent. Zeitg.). This species, like the others, appears to be part of his work on insect taxonomy.  \n\nFurther, Czerny is noted as a scholar who described the species *Phaonia pullata* (referred to as \"\"Ph. pullata\"\" in the data) and other related taxa. The inclusion of \"\"等物种\"\" (\"\"and others\"\") in the Chinese description suggests his work extended beyond the explicitly named species, though specific details about these additional contributions are not provided. The consistency in the years and publications across the descriptions indicates that Czerny’s taxonomic work was active in the early 20th century, particularly in 1906, when he documented *Strobilomyia anthracinum* and *Chortophila anthracina*.  \n\nThe descriptions do not present direct contradictions but require synthesis to clarify the scope of Czerny’s contributions. For instance, while *Strobilomyia anthracinum* and *Chortophila anthracina* are both tied to 1906, the latter’s connection to Czerny is phrased as \"\"associated with,\"\" which could imply either a direct description or a secondary role in its study. However, the repeated mention of *Strobilomyia anthracinum* in two separate descriptions (1906 and a general association) supports the conclusion that this species was definitively described by Czerny. The Chinese description adds *Phaonia pullata* to his list of described species, though the year for this contribution is unspecified.  \n\nIn summary, Czerny is recognized for his work in describing and classifying several insect species, including *Strobilomyia anthracinum* (1906), *Chortophila anthracina* (1906), *Pegohylemyia sanctimarci* (in *Wiener Entomologische Zeitung*), and *Phaonia pullata*. His research, spanning the early 1900s, reflects a focus on entomological taxonomy, with notable publications in specialized journals. The lack of detailed dates for some species and the ambiguity in the role of *Chortophila anthracina* are resolved by emphasizing the confirmed descriptions and contextualizing the others as part of his broader scholarly activity.\",5\n619,STROBILOMYIA ANTHRACINUM,Strobilomyia anthracinum is a species of fly described by Czerny in 1906,1\n1220,WIEEN ENT ZEITG,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n554,CZERNY,STROBILOMYIA ANTHRACINUM,Czerny described the species Strobilomyia anthracinum in 1906,6\n1725,CZERNY,WIEEN ENT ZEITG,Czerny originally described Pegohylemyia sanctimarci in Wien.
