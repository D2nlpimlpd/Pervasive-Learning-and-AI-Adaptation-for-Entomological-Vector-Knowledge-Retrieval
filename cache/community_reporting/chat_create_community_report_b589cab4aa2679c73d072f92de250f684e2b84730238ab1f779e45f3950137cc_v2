In 1983, Feng documented the *Cephalopina titillator* species, a parasitic organism found in camels, and highlighted its prevalence in these areas. This work contributed to understanding the distribution and host relationships of the parasite, which is significant for veterinary science and public health in regions where camels are a key livestock species. Feng’s research on *C. titillator* is cited as part of broader investigations into parasitic infections in camels, emphasizing the ecological and agricultural importance of the species in arid and semi-arid zones of northwestern China. Additionally, Feng is referenced for other studies conducted in Ningxia and Gansu, further underscoring their role in advancing knowledge of regional parasitology. The combination of these contributions positions Feng Lanzhou as a notable figure in the study of camel-associated parasites and their impact on local ecosystems and animal husbandry practices.\",1\n335,MODEER,\"\n\n**MODEER** is a historical figure recognized for their contributions to taxonomy, particularly in the description of two distinct species. The first documented contribution attributes Modeer to the description of *Cephalopina titillator* in 1786, a species belonging to the family Cephalopinidae. This classification is part of the broader context of 18th-century taxonomic work, during which many invertebrate species were formally named and categorized. The second reference notes Modeer as a scientist cited in the description of *Cephenomyia trompe*, a member of the Tachinidae family (commonly known as tachinid flies), specifically in \"\"figure A44\"\" of an unspecified publication. While the exact year for the *Cephenomyia trompe* reference is not provided, the inclusion of a figure suggests it may be part of a visual or illustrative work, possibly a later study or a compendium of taxonomic illustrations.  \n\nThese two accounts highlight Modeer’s role in entomology and invertebrate taxonomy, though the species they described or referenced belong to different taxonomic groups. *Cephalopina titillator* is a parasitic fly species, while *Cephenomyia trompe* is also a tachinid fly, indicating Modeer’s potential focus on Diptera (flies) or related taxa. The discrepancy in the family name for *Cephenomyia trompe*—noted as \"\"狂蝇科\"\" in the original data—corresponds to the English term Tachinidae, resolving the contradiction by aligning the Chinese and English nomenclature.  \n\nModeer’s work in 1786 on *Cephalopina titillator* reflects the systematic approach to species classification during the Linnaean era, whereas the reference to *Cephenomyia trompe* in a figure underscores the integration of visual documentation in later taxonomic studies. Together, these contributions establish Modeer as a scientist with expertise in describing and illustrating dipteran species, though the specific scope of their research and the publications they authored remain unclear. The combination of these descriptions provides a cohesive overview of Modeer’s legacy in entomology, emphasizing their role in advancing the understanding of parasitic flies and related organisms.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11713,CEPHALOPINA TITILLATOR,OESTRUS,Cephalopina titillator is a species within the Oestrus genus,6\n11715,CEPHALOPINA TITILLATOR,FENG LANZHOU,Feng Lanzhou studied and documented the species in 1983,5\n12060,MODEER,CEPHALOPINA TITILLATOR,Modeer is the person who described the species Cephalopina titillator in 1786,5\n11716,OESTRUS,OESTRUS OVIS,Oestrus ovis is the type species of the Oestrus genus,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
