It is taxonomically classified within the tribes Protodexiini and Blaesoxiphini, as noted in the provided data. The genus is characterized by distinct morphological features, including angular frontal projections on the head, 2–3 postalar bristles on the thorax, and notable differences in male and female genital structures. Female specimens of *Blaesoxipha* are further distinguished by an ovate abdomen and square lateral anal lobes, as highlighted in the third description. \n\nOne of the species associated with this genus is *Agriella gobica*, though the accuracy of this classification requires verification, as *Agriella* is typically a separate genus within the same fly family. The primary ecological role of *Blaesoxipha* involves parasitism, with documented interactions targeting beetles of the family Tenebrionidae (darkling beetles) and grasshoppers of the family Acrididae. These parasitic behaviors suggest a specialized niche in controlling or interacting with these insect groups, potentially as part of a broader biological control mechanism in their ecosystems. \n\nThe morphological traits of *Blaesoxipha*—particularly the angular frontal projections and the specific genital structures—likely aid in distinguishing it from closely related genera within the Protodexiini tribe. The square lateral anal lobes in females further contribute to its taxonomic uniqueness. While the data does not clarify whether *Blaesoxipha* is a subgenus or a distinct genus within Protodexiini, its placement in both Protodexiini and Blaesoxiphini tribes implies a possible hierarchical or overlapping classification within the subfamily. This dual tribal affiliation may reflect ongoing taxonomic debates or revisions in the family Tachinidae, to which *Blaesoxipha* belongs. \n\nIn summary, *Blaesoxipha* is a historically established genus of parasitic flies with unique anatomical features, including angular head projections, specific bristle counts, and distinct genitalia. Its ecological significance lies in its parasitism of Tenebrionidae and Acrididae, though the inclusion of *Agriella gobica* as a species example may require further validation. The genus remains a subject of taxonomic interest due to its morphological specialization and placement within multiple tribes of the Protodexiinae subfamily. \n\n(Word count: 249)\",6\n4684,AGRIELLA GOBICA,\"A species of fly in the genus Blaesoxipha, characterized by 1-3 pre-alar bristles, closed or stalked 2R5 cells, S-shaped m-m crossvein, and specific morphological features of male and female genitalia.
