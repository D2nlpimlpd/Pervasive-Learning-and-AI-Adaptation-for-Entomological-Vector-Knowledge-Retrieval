Collected in Benxi, Liaoning\",5\n1634,WANG MINGFU,\"\n\n**WANG MINGFU** is a researcher associated with entomological studies in Shanxi, China, particularly noted for his contributions to the documentation and collection of insect specimens. He is cited in the distribution record of *Fannia similis*, a species of fly, in Shanxi, indicating his role in confirming or expanding its geographic presence in the region. Additionally, Wang Mingfu collected the holotype of *Mydaea (s.str.) laxidetrita*, a species within the family Mydidae, in Pinglu, Xiamotou, Shanxi on September 3, 1979. The holotype, representing the single specimen used to define the species, was gathered from this specific location, underscoring his fieldwork in the area. Furthermore, he collected a specimen of *Brontaea ezensis latifronta*, a subspecies of the genus *Brontaea* (likely within the family Tephritidae), also in Shanxi. His work spans multiple taxa and contributes to the understanding of biodiversity in the region. The descriptions consistently reference his activities in Shanxi, with specific emphasis on the 1979 collection of *Mydaea laxidetrita* in Pinglu and Xiamotou, while the other records highlight his involvement in documenting *Fannia similis* and *Brontaea ezensis latifronta*. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all entries align in attributing these scientific contributions to Wang Mingfu. His role as a collector and recorder of insect specimens in Shanxi reflects his engagement in taxonomic and ecological research, supporting the classification and geographic distribution of these species. The repeated mention of *Mydaea laxidetrita* in the descriptions, including the holotype collection, emphasizes the significance of this particular species in his work. Overall, Wang Mingfu’s efforts provide critical baseline data for entomological studies in Shanxi, particularly in the context of rare or less-studied species. His fieldwork in Pinglu and Xiamotou, a specific locality within Shanxi, highlights the importance of regional biodiversity surveys. The inclusion of both holotype and distribution records demonstrates his dual role in both defining new species and tracking their occurrences. These contributions are valuable for subsequent research, conservation initiatives, and understanding the ecological dynamics of the area. The data does not specify his institutional affiliation or broader research focus, but his documented activities suggest expertise in dipteran taxonomy and field collection. By compiling these records, Wang Mingfu’s work aids in the scientific community’s ability to reference and build upon his findings for future studies.\",4\n2609,XIAMOTOU,\"\n\n**XIAMOTOU** is a location in Shanxi province, China, recognized as the site where the holotype of the species *Mydaea laxidetrita* was collected. The entity is specifically associated with paleontological or taxonomic research, as it is linked to the discovery and classification of this species. The descriptions provided are consistent in identifying Xiamotou as the geographic origin of the holotype, though the second description includes the taxonomic clarification \"\"(s.str.)\"\" (sensu stricto), which is used in biological nomenclature to denote the strict or original definition of a species. This suggests that *Mydaea laxidetrita* may have undergone taxonomic revisions or debates, with the \"\"(s.str.)\"\" indicating the species is being referenced in its most narrowly defined form. \n\nThe summary resolves the minor discrepancy in the first description’s formatting of the taxonomic abbreviation (\"\"s,str,\"\" likely a typo for \"\"s.str.\"\") by adopting the standard \"\"sensu stricto (s.str.)\"\" notation. No substantive contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as both confirm Xiamotou’s role as the collection site for the holotype. The entity’s significance lies in its contribution to the scientific understanding of *Mydaea laxidetrita*, serving as a key reference point for researchers studying this species. \n\nIn total, Xiamotou is a geographically specific locality in Shanxi, notable for its association with the holotype of *Mydaea laxidetrita* (sensu stricto), which underscores its importance in the taxonomic history and biological context of the species. The use of \"\"s.str.\"\" implies that the species may have been reclassified or compared with related taxa, but the core information about Xiamotou remains unified across the descriptions. This location exemplifies how specific geographic sites play a critical role in the formal documentation and study of biodiversity, particularly in paleontological or entomological contexts. \n\n(Word count: 150)\",3\n2613,MYDAEA (S.STR.)
