It is home to the blowfly *Musca convexifrons*, which is found in locations such as Xi’an, Zhongnan Mountain, and Hanzhong. The province also supports the presence of *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Mydaea setifemur*, and *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri*, all of which are documented within its borders. Additionally, *Voria ruralis* and *Hemipyrellia liguriens* (specifically in Hanzhong) are reported to inhabit Shaanxi. The region serves as a domestic distribution site for *Musca bezzii* and *Musca larvipara*, as well as *Polleniopsis mongolica* and *Haematobia titillans*. \n\nShaanxi’s ecological diversity is further highlighted by the presence of *Amobia distorta*, which is distributed in the Qinling Mountains at elevations between 300 and 1,512 meters. The province hosts multiple *Phaonia* species, including *Phaonia angustiprosternum*, *Phaonia sinierrans*, *Phaonia shubeiensis*, and others, with *Phaonia vagata* having its type locality at Huanglong Mountain and *Phaonia vulpinus* also documented there. *Phaonia shaanxiensis* is specifically associated with Taibai Mountain, another notable site within the province. \n\nOther species recorded in Shaanxi include *Anthomyia illocata*, *Gymnadichosia pusilla*, and *Miltogramma iberium*. The region is also significant for the distribution of *Drymeia aculeata* and *Drymeia grapsopoda*. Beyond flies, Shaanxi is noted for the presence of *Kramerea schuetzei*, a species likely referring to a plant or insect, though its exact classification is unspecified in the data. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Shaanxi’s role as a key ecological hub in China for these species, with specific localities such as Hanzhong, Huanglong Mountain, and Taibai Mountain serving as important habitats. The province’s varied geography, including mountainous areas like the Qinling range, contributes to the biodiversity observed in its insect populations. While some entries use general terms like “the fly species” or “the species,” the specific names and locations provided align cohesively, underscoring Shaanxi’s significance in entomological studies and its contribution to the broader understanding of species distribution in China. The data does not present contradictions, allowing for a unified summary of the province’s ecological relevance.\",26\n3510,PHANONIA SHAANXISENSIS,,4\n3099,\"DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPP.

It holds ecological and taxonomic significance as a key site for entomological research. Specifically, Qianshan is recognized as the type locality for *Phaonia angustiprosternum*, a species in the fly family Muscidae, which means it is the geographic location where this species was first formally described and documented. Additionally, the mountain is associated with the distribution of *Megophyra* species, a genus within the hoverfly family Syrphidae, highlighting its role as a habitat or ecological reference point for these insects. \n\nThe connection to *Phaonia angustiprosternum* underscores Qianshan's importance in the study of dipteran taxonomy, as type localities are critical for defining and validating species classifications. Meanwhile, the presence of *Megophyra* species in the region suggests that Qianshan's environment supports biodiversity relevant to syrphid flies, which are often studied for their ecological roles as pollinators and indicators of ecosystem health. While the two descriptions focus on different insect groups, they collectively emphasize Qianshan's value as a site for scientific investigation into arthropod diversity and biogeography. \n\nGeographically, Qianshan is part of the broader landscape of Liaoning Province, an area known for its rich fossil deposits and diverse ecosystems. The mountain's specific location in Anshan may contribute to unique microhabitats that facilitate the presence of these species. However, the descriptions provided do not clarify whether the *Megophyra* species are endemic to Qianshan or merely part of a wider regional distribution. Further research would be needed to determine the extent of the mountain's influence on these taxa. \n\nIn summary, Qianshan in Anshan, Liaoning, China, serves as both a type locality for *Phaonia angustiprosternum* and a site linked to *Megophyra* species distribution, reflecting its dual role in entomological science as a reference point for taxonomic work and a habitat for ecologically significant insects. These associations highlight the mountain's contribution to understanding the biodiversity and evolutionary history of dipteran species in the region. \n\n(Word count: 200)\",1\n1904,DRYMEIA GRAPSOPODA,,2\n1905,CAO,,10\n3425,PHAOINIA DISMAGNICONDIS,\"Fly species described in 1989 by Xue and Cao with type locality in Taibai Mountain, Shaanxi\",5\n2598,TAIBAI MOUNTAIN,\"\n\n**TAIBAI MOUNTAIN** is a prominent geographical entity located in Shaanxi Province, China.
