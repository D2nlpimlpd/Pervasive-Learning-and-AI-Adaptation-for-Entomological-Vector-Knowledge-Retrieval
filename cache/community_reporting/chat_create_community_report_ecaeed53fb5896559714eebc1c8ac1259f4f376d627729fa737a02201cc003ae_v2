The country hosts a diverse array of flies, including *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, and *Musca seniorwhitei*, as well as *Dichaetomyia luteiventer*, *Dichaetomyia apicalis*, and *Dichaetomyia quadrata*. It is also the type locality for *Dichaetomyia keiseri* and *Ceylonomyia nigripes*, underscoring its role in the taxonomic classification of these species. Additionally, Sri Lanka is home to *Caiusa testacea*, with *Bengalia labiata* as its type species, and supports populations of *Bengalia* spp., *Borbororhina bivittata*, *Borbororhinia bivittata*, *Haematobia minuta*, *Halydaia* and *Linnaemyia* spp., *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, *Leucomyia cinerea*, *Myospila argentata*, *Lasiopelta* spp., *Pegomya quadrivittata*, and the Indian greenbottle fly. Specific species such as *Anthomyia illocata*, *Anthomyia plumiseta*, *Atherigona exigua*, and *Atherigona triglomerata* are documented within its borders, alongside the Chinese-named species *紫翠蝇* (likely *Chrysomya bezziana* or a related *Chrysomya* species) and *612黄髭芒蝇* (possibly *Chrysomya pinguis* or another *Chrysomya* species). The genus *Stomorhina* is also reported to have multiple species distributed in Sri Lanka as a foreign location. Notably, Sri Lanka serves as a type locality for *Tainanina pilisquama* and *1394叉形亚麻蝇* (likely *Chrysomya pinguis* or a related species), while it is a foreign distribution site for *Musca crassirostris*, *Sarcophaga misera*, and *Sarcophaga sericea*. The country further records the presence of *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Neomyia* spp., and *Ophyra chalcogaster*. These findings highlight Sri Lanka’s ecological importance as both a native and secondary distribution hub for various fly taxa, contributing to global biodiversity and taxonomic studies. The repeated references to \"\"the species\"\" in vague terms suggest broader, less specific records, but the detailed mentions of individual species and genera confirm its role in supporting a rich and varied fly fauna.\",37\n4815,IRANIHINDIA,\"\n\n**IRANIHINDIA** is a genus of blow flies belonging to the Sarcophagidae family, predominantly found in the Oriental region. The genus is distinguished by several morphological traits, particularly in male specimens. Males of *IRANIHINDIA* exhibit a narrow frons (the area between the eyes and antennae) and long antennae, which are key identifiers for the group. Additionally, the genus is characterized by specific abdominal bristle patterns, including the presence of developed abdominal median bristles and spiny bristles at the tip of the abdomen. Another notable feature is the male anal leaf, which displays a central concavity, a structural detail that further differentiates *IRANIHINDIA* from related genera. These combined traits—narrow frons, elongated antennae, specialized abdominal bristles, and the concave anal leaf—serve as diagnostic markers for taxonomic classification within the Sarcophagidae family. The descriptions provided align in emphasizing abdominal bristle morphology and male-specific structures, with no direct contradictions. The genus is primarily associated with the Oriental biogeographic region, reflecting its ecological and geographic context.\",8\n2068,IRAN,\"\n\nIran, a Middle Eastern country, is recognized as a significant region for the distribution of various fly species across multiple genera and families. It is documented as a country where *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *Sarcophaga haematodes* are present, contributing to the global range of the Sarcophagini tribe, which is referenced in taxonomic keys. Additionally, Iran hosts *Dasyphora asiatica*, a species associated with its ecological diversity. The Haematobia genus, including *Haematobia titillans*, *H. minuta*, and *H. irritans*, is also reported to be distributed there, highlighting its role in parasitic fly habitats. \n\nIran’s biodiversity further includes *Lispe leucospila*, *Musca larvipara*, and *Musca sorbens* (also known as 马粪碧蝇 in Chinese), with the latter being noted as an international distribution site. The country has foreign distribution records for *Musca crassirostris*, indicating its presence in non-native regions. The Helicophagella genus and *Bayan Wohlfahrtia* (a species of Wohlfahrtia fly) are also associated with Iran as part of their global ranges. \n\nNotably, *Metopodia grisea* and *Chrysomya pinguis* are explicitly mentioned as species found in Iran, underscoring its importance in the study of blowflies and flesh flies. The country is further referenced as a foreign location where multiple species of the Stomorhina genus occur, though specific species names are not provided. A Chinese text also notes the presence of species like \"\"1254钝叶污蝇\"\" (likely a catalog or regional identifier) in Iran, though the exact taxonomic classification of this species remains unclear. \n\nIn summary, Iran serves as a critical distribution hub for a wide array of fly species, including parasitic, myiasis-causing, and common blowflies. Its inclusion in taxonomic keys and foreign distribution records emphasizes its ecological and zoogeographical relevance. The presence of both native and non-native species, such as *Musca crassirostris*, reflects the country’s role in broader biogeographical patterns.
