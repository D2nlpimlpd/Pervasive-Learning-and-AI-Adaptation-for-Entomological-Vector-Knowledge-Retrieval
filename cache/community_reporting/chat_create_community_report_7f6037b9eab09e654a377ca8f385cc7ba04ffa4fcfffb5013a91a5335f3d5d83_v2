These species, which are likely of medical or entomological significance, were formally documented in the journal, contributing to the scientific understanding of their taxonomy, biology, or public health relevance. Additionally, the journal is cited as a reference for *Ceylonomyia nigripes*, a species that may also hold importance in medical or ecological contexts. While the specific details of the studies or the roles of these species in the journal’s content are not elaborated, the inclusion of both *Musca* and *Ceylonomyia* species highlights the journal’s role in advancing research on medically important arthropods. The **Indian Journal of Medical Research** thus appears to be a key resource for taxonomic and applied entomological studies, particularly those involving species with potential implications for human health or disease transmission. Its contributions to the documentation of these species underscore its value in the field of medical science, where accurate classification and understanding of vectors or pests are critical for effective intervention strategies. The journal’s dual role in describing *Musca* species and referencing *Ceylonomyia nigripes* suggests a broad scope in entomological research, though the exact nature of its focus on these taxa remains tied to the provided data. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they reference distinct species groups within the journal’s published works.\",6\n2193,JOSEPH,\"\n\n**JOSEPH** is recognized as a co-describer of the species *Musca santoshi* alongside Parui in 1922. This collaboration resulted in the formal identification and classification of the species, which is also known in Chinese as 伪毛颧家蝇 (*pèi máo quán jiā yí*). The descriptions provided consistently highlight JOSEPH's role in this taxonomic work, emphasizing his partnership with Parui to document the characteristics of *Musca santoshi*. While the specific details of JOSEPH's contributions or background are not elaborated in the given data, his co-authorship with Parui in 1922 is a key point of alignment across all three descriptions. The entity \"\"JOSEPH\"\" is directly linked to this scientific endeavor, and the species name remains a central focus of the information. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as they all corroborate the same historical fact of joint authorship and the associated species. The summary integrates the English and Chinese terminology to ensure clarity and contextual completeness, reflecting the multilingual nature of the provided data. JOSEPH's association with *Musca santoshi* is thus firmly established as a collaborative achievement in 1922, with the species name serving as a lasting reference to their work.\",3\n2194,PARUI,\"\n\n**PARUI** is a scientist recognized for co-describing the species *Musca santoshi* (commonly referred to as 伪毛颧家蝇 in Chinese) alongside Joseph in 1922. This collaborative work was published in the *Indian Journal of Medical Research* (Ind. J. Med. Res.), a prominent scientific journal. The species *Musca santoshi* is a type of fly, and its description by Parui and Joseph marked a significant contribution to entomological taxonomy during that period. The inclusion of the Chinese name for the species highlights its regional recognition or usage in specific contexts. While the descriptions provided do not elaborate on Parui’s broader scientific background or other contributions, they collectively establish their role in the formal classification of *Musca santoshi* through joint research with Joseph. The year 1922 and the journal’s name are consistent across all accounts, resolving any potential ambiguity. This summary consolidates the key details from the descriptions, emphasizing Parui’s collaboration, the species in question, and the publication venue.
