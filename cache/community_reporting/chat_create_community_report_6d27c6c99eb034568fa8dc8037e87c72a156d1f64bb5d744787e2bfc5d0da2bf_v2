They collected the holotype for *Paradichosia blaesostyla* in 1982 and the holotype for *Paradichosia brachyphalla* in 1987, both of which are significant in the formal description and classification of these species. Additionally, FENG YAN is credited with collecting the holotype specimen for *Megophyra subpenicillata*, a species native to Sichuan Province, specifically in the Ya’an Zhougong Mountain region. This latter collection highlights their role in documenting plant biodiversity in ecologically diverse areas of China. The three holotypes attributed to FENG YAN—*Paradichosia blaesostyla*, *Paradichosia brachyphalla*, and *Megophyra subpenicillata*—reflect their expertise in identifying and preserving representative specimens for scientific study. While the first two collections are dated to 1982 and 1987, respectively, the *Megophyra subpenicillata* holotype’s collection year is not explicitly mentioned in the provided data. However, all descriptions consistently attribute the *Megophyra* specimen to Sichuan, with the most specific location being Ya’an Zhougong Mountain. FENG YAN’s work underscores their importance in advancing taxonomic research, particularly in the documentation of rare or regionally significant plant species. Their contributions provide critical reference points for future studies, ensuring accurate identification and classification within the field of botany. By collecting holotypes across different years and regions, FENG YAN has left a lasting impact on the understanding of plant diversity in China.\",5\n3914,PARADICHOSIA BLAESOSTYLA,,7\n3915,PARADICHOSIA BRACHYPHALLA,,7\n883,YA'AN,\"\n\nYa’an is a city located in Sichuan Province, China, recognized as a significant site for entomological research and biodiversity.

The city is also home to several other notable species, including *Paradichosia blaesostyla*, *Paradichosia brachyphalla*, and *Paradichosia kangdingensis*, which are documented as occurring within its boundaries. Additionally, Ya’an is part of the **distribution range** for *Isomyia electa* and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, further highlighting its role in supporting diverse fly populations. \n\nThe area is associated with the presence of *Hebecnema fumosa*, a species specifically recorded in Ya’an, and *Megophyra subpenicillata*, which has been collected there. These findings contribute to Ya’an’s reputation as a key location for studying and cataloging species within Sichuan’s rich ecosystems. The city’s inclusion in multiple descriptions as a **specific location** or **type locality** for various taxa suggests it serves as a focal point for biological surveys and taxonomic work. While some descriptions emphasize Ya’an’s role in the initial discovery of species (e.g., *Phaonia cothurnoloba*), others note its broader association with species distribution and collection, indicating a combination of historical and ongoing ecological significance. \n\nIn summary, Ya’an, Sichuan, China, is a critical hub for entomological studies, hosting the type locality of *Phaonia cothurnoloba* and serving as a habitat or collection site for *Paradichosia blaesostyla*, *Paradichosia brachyphalla*, *Paradichosia kangdingensis*, *Isomyia electa*, *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Hebecnema fumosa*, and *Megophyra subpenicillata*.
