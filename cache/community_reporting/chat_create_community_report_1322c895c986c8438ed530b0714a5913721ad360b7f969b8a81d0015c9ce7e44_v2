Their work spans multiple genera, including *Mydaea*, *Limnophora*, *Helina*, *Phaonia*, *Brontaea*, and *Drymeia*. XUE described the new subspecies *Mydaea setifemur kongdinga* and the new species *Mydaea tinctoscutaris*. They also authored descriptions for *Limnophora nigra* (1984) and *Limnophora nigrilineata*, as well as *Limnophora purgata* and *Limnophora fallax septentrionalis* (1984). In the *Helina* genus, XUE is credited with describing *Helina fica*, *Helina subpubiseta* (1986), *Helina longiquadrata*, *Helina calathocerca*, *Helina graciliapica*, *Helina laticerca*, and *Helina nudifemorata latiscissa*, while co-authoring *Helina nigriannosa* and *Helina biconiformis* with collaborators.  \n\nXUE’s most extensive work involves the *Phaonia* genus, where they described numerous species, including *Phaonia cothurnoloba* (1989, *Acta Zoologica Sinica*), *Phaonia guangdongensis*, *Phaonia brunneiabdomina*, *Phaonia dismagnicornis*, *Phaonia flavivivida*, *Phaonia pallatoides*, *Phaonia dawushanensis*, *Phaonia subvivida*, *Phaonia septentrionalis* (1984), *Phaonia huanrenensis* (1984, *昆虫学报*), *Phaonia longifurca* (1984), *Phaonia qingheensis*, *Phaonia vagata*, *Phaonia benxiensis*, *Phaonia shaanxiensis*, *Phaonia chuanierrans*, *Phaonia subnigrisquama*, and *Phaonia beizhenesis*. Collaborations with Wang are noted in the description of *Brontaea ezensis latifronta* (1984) and *Brontaea genurufoidea*, as well as the subspecies *ezensis latifronta Xue et Wang, ssp. n.*. Additionally, XUE co-authored *Phaonia jinbeiensis* and *Phaonia mimobitrigona* in *Acta Zoologica Sinica* and the *Journal of the Liaoning Zoological Society*.  \n\nBeyond species descriptions, XUE conducted a 1982 population fluctuation survey of *Bellardia nartshukae* in Liaoning, China. They also described *Drymeia grapsopoda* in *昆虫分类学报* (1989) and are recognized as the describer of *Changbaishan Dianchi Fly* (长白山点池蝇), a species associated with the Changbai Mountains region. Their research has been published in prominent entomological journals, reflecting a focus on both regional biodiversity and taxonomic advancements.  \n\nXUE’s work demonstrates a broad expertise in dipteran taxonomy, with a particular emphasis on *Phaonia* and *Brontaea* species, as well as subspecies and population studies. Their collaborations, especially with Wang, highlight a pattern of joint research efforts in the field.
