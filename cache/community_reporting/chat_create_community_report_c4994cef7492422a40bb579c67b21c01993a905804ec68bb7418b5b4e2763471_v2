The region is also home to *Limnophora fallax fallax*, *Limnophora albitarsis*, and *Limnophora tigrina tigrina*, with the latter having Tainan as its type locality. Additionally, *Lasiopelta longicornis*, *Hebecnema fumosa*, and *Caricea boops* are documented in Taiwan, alongside *Drino curvipalpis* and *Helina lateralis*.  \n\nMultiple species of the genus *Myospila* are found in Taiwan, including *Myospila laevis*, *Myospila meditabunda brunettiana*, and *Myospila meditabunda meditabunda*. The region hosts several *Dichaetomyia* species, such as *Dichaetomyia quadrata* and others recorded in cities like Kaohsiung, Taichung, Tainan, Hengchun, and Chiayi. Notable species include *Chrysomya pinguis*, *Chrysomya megacephala*, and *Chrysomya bezziana*, distributed in areas like Xinzhu, Fenglin, and Kenting. *Phaonia fuscata*, *Phaonia villana*, and *Anthomyia illocata* are also present, with *Phaonia fuscata* specifically noted in Tainan.  \n\nTaiwan functions as a type locality for certain species, such as *PIERRETIACAUDAGALLI* and *PIERRETIAPROSBALIINA*, as well as *Metopia sauteri* (type locality: Dazukou) and *Carcelia kockiana*. The region is associated with *Gymnadichosia pusilla* (type locality: Tainan) and *Pegomya bicolor* (type locality in Penghu). Fly larvae have been observed in animal corpses in Taiwan, and it is a domestic distribution site for *Muscidae* subfamilies, including *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca crassirostris*, *Musca conducens*, and *Musca sorbens*.  \n\nOther documented species include *Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri*, *Bengalia (Ochromyia) taiwanensis*, *Borbororhina bivittata*, *Emmesomyia ovata*, *Emmesomyia dorsalis*, *Hylemya* species, *Sinohylemya*, *Sarcosolomonia* species, *Neomyia* species (e.g., Kaohsiung), *Sarcorohdendorfia antilope*, and *Sarcorohdendorfia mimobasalis*.
