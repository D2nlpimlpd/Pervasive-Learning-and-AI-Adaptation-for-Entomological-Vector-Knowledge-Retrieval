It is officially titled *动物分类学报* in Chinese and is commonly referenced in English as either *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica* or *Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy*. The journal has served as a platform for studies on insect classification, including detailed work on species such as *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Shakshainia rametoka*, and *Helina calceatricula*. Notably, it has also been cited in the formal description of *Iranihindia spinosa*, which was documented in 1985.  \n\nResearch published in the journal spans both regional and global entomological contributions. For instance, Gao Jingming and collaborators have utilized the journal to advance blowfly classification, a critical area in forensic entomology and ecological studies. The journal’s scope is further illustrated by its inclusion of taxonomic analyses on diverse insect groups, reflecting its role in documenting biodiversity and systematic research.  \n\nThe journal’s dual English names—*Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica* and *Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy*—likely stem from historical or translational variations, but both refer to the same publication under the Chinese title *动物分类学报*. This ambiguity is resolved by emphasizing the Chinese name as the primary identifier, with the English titles noted as alternative references. The journal’s prominence in the field is underscored by its long-standing tradition of publishing foundational taxonomic work, such as the 1985 description of *Iranihindia spinosa*, which highlights its role in formalizing new species discoveries.  \n\nIn summary, the *动物分类学报* (Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica / Chinese Journal of Animal Taxonomy) is a key Chinese journal in animal taxonomy, particularly entomology, with a history of publishing significant studies on insect classification by researchers like Gao Jingming. It has documented species such as *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Shakshainia rametoka*, *Helina calceatricula*, and *Iranihindia spinosa*, the latter of which was formally described in 1985. The journal bridges regional and international taxonomic research, offering a platform for both Chinese and global scientific communities to contribute to the understanding of animal biodiversity. Its dual English titles reflect its multilingual accessibility, though the Chinese name remains its definitive identifier. The journal’s contributions to blowfly classification and other insect groups demonstrate its importance in advancing systematic entomology and related disciplines.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",19\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5951,PHAONIA MIMOFUSTA,MA,Ma co-described Phaonia mimofausta with Wu,86\n5957,MA,PHAONIA MIMOTENUISETA,Ma co-described Phaonia mimotenuiseta with Wu,85\n5958,MA,PHAONIA SUBTENUISETA,Ma co-described Phaonia subtenuiseta with Wu,85\n5959,MA,PHAONIA DECUSSATOIDES,Ma co-described Phaonia decussatoides with Wu,85\n5663,ANIMAL TAXONOMY JOURNAL,HELINA LATICERCIA,\"The species Helina laticerca is described in the journal \"\"动物分类学报\"\"\",23\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
