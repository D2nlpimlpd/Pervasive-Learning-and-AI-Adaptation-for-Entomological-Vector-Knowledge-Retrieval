This collaborative work marked a significant contribution to the field of entomology, particularly in the classification of parasitic flies within the family Tachinidae. The genus *Prosena* is characterized by its elongated proboscis, a feature that distinguishes it from other tachinid genera. Le Peletier’s partnership with Serville in this taxonomic endeavor highlights their shared expertise in studying insect morphology and ecology during the early 19th century. While the descriptions provided do not elaborate on Le Peletier’s broader scientific career or other contributions, the co-creation of *Prosena* remains a key point in their joint legacy. The use of both the scientific name *Prosena* and its Chinese counterpart, 长喙寄蝇属, underscores the genus’s relevance in international taxonomic literature. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they align in attributing the 1828 co-description to Le Peletier and Serville.
