It is characterized by a reddish-yellow body and black abdominal tergites, distinguishing it within its taxonomic group. The species is native to China, where it has been documented in the provinces of Liaoning, Qinghai (specifically Yushu), Zhejiang, Fujian, and Yunnan. Beyond its domestic range, *Gonia klapperichi* is also found in Europe (excluding the United Kingdom) and North Africa, indicating a transcontinental distribution. \n\nEcologically, *Gonia klapperichi* plays a parasitic role in the life cycles of certain moth larvae. It specifically targets the larvae of *Agrotis segetum* (common cutworm) and *Phragmatobia fuliginosa* (a species of noctuid moth), contributing to natural pest control in its habitats. This parasitism highlights its functional significance in ecosystems where these host species are prevalent. \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in detailing the species’ taxonomy, physical traits, geographic distribution, and ecological role. No contradictions exist between the sources, allowing for a unified summary. The entity’s name is correctly capitalized as \"\"Gonia klapperichi\"\" in both references, and its classification under the *Gonia* genus is reiterated. The inclusion of both domestic and international regions, along with specific host associations, ensures a comprehensive overview of its biological and geographical context. \n\nIn summary, *Gonia klapperichi* is a 1956-described parasitic fly species with a reddish-yellow body and black abdominal tergites, inhabiting parts of China, Europe (excluding the UK), and North Africa. It is notable for its role in parasitizing larvae of *Agrotis segetum* and *Phragmatobia fuliginosa*, underscoring its ecological impact.
