Its vast territory, including areas like Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, supported diverse taxa across multiple families. Key species documented in the Soviet Union include **Macronychia striginervis** and **Macronychia polyodon**, as well as **Pseudocoenosia fletcheri**, which extended into Siberia and the Ural Mountains. The **Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia** and **Robineauella scoparia** were noted in its European part, Turkestan, Siberia, the Far East, Ussuri border, and Sakhalin Island.  \n\nThe Soviet Union hosted multiple **Helina** species, such as *H. confinis* (Far East, Northern and Central Europe), *H. cothurnata*, *H. latitarsis*, *H. parcepilosa*, *H. obscuratoides*, *H. lasiophthalma*, and *H. punctifemoralis*, distributed across Siberia, Tajikistan, and the European region. **Parasarcophaga** species like *P. pleskei*, *P. portschinskyi*, and *P. emdeni* were also recorded, alongside **Phaonia** species such as *P. fuscata* (Far East, Western Siberia, Tajikistan, and northern/central Europe), *P. malaisei*, *P. hybrida*, *P. nigripennis*, *P. luteovittata*, and *P. asierrans*. **Phormia regina** was found in the European part, Siberia, and Transbaikal, while **Strobilomyia laricicola** and multiple **Strobilomyia** species were documented in Siberia and Baikal Lake regions.  \n\nOther notable species included **Tachina albidopilosa**, **Servillia ardens**, and **Tachina nupta**; **Fannia kowarzi**, **Fannia prisca**, and **Fannia canicularis**; **Goniophyto formosensis**, **Goniophyto honshuensis**, and **Goniophyto** in the Far East. The **Oestromyia** genus was present in the Far East, Central Asia, Siberia, and Transcaucasia, while **Oestrus** species were noted in Central Asia and southern Europe. **Musca larvipara** and **Musca sorbens** were reported, with the former’s life cycle studied in the region. **Pollenomyia sinensis** and **Pollenomyia pusilla** were found in the Far East, particularly in Primorsky Krai.  \n\nThe Soviet Union also served as a type locality for species like **Phormiata phormiata** (Tajikistan) and **Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi** (Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan). Research contributions from Soviet scientists, such as K.Б. Борнцова-Эннинова’s work on *Holotrichia diomphalia*, further highlight its role in entomological studies. Additional species documented there include **Lispe frigida** (Siberia), **Lispe leucospila**, **Miltogramma bimaculatum**, **Miltogrammoides**, **Hydrotaea palaestrica**, **Hydrotaea bimaculata**, **Calliphora axata** (Siberia, Chita), and **Protocalliphora lii**.  \n\nChinese-named species like 1279膨端折麻蝇, 1280钩阳折麻蝇, 1281毛股折麻蝇, 1396犁头亚麻蝇, and 古北蝗蝇 were also associated with the Soviet Union, particularly in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian regions. The country’s ecological diversity supported rare or regionally specific species, such as **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, **Blaesoxipha unicolor**, **Blaesoxipha arenicola**, **Sinonipponia**, **Sarcorohdendorfia antilope**, **Limnophora nigripes**, **Bercaea cruentata**, and **Paregle aterrima**.  \n\nIn summary, the Soviet Union’s expansive and varied ecosystems, from the European plains to the Far East and Central Asia, provided habitats for a wide array of flies and related insects, many of which remain subjects of taxonomic and ecological study. Its historical role as a distribution center for these species, combined with contributions to scientific research, underscores its importance in entomological records.
