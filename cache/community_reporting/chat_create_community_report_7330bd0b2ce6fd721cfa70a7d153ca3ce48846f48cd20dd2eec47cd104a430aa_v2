Adults are ectoparasites of cattle, with females laying eggs on fresh dung\",16\n2466,AZORES,\"\n\nThe **Azores** is an archipelago located in the **Atlantic Ocean**, comprising a group of islands that serve as a significant ecological and geographical region for various species. It is explicitly noted as the distribution site of **Haematobia irritans**, a species of fly, and **Bercaea cruentata**, an insect belonging to the Sarcophagini family. Additionally, the **Helicophagella genus**, which includes species adapted to specific environmental niches, is also documented as being present in the Azores. The region is further highlighted in taxonomic contexts as a foreign area referenced in a **Sarcophagini taxonomic key**, indicating its relevance in entomological studies for distinguishing species within this family. While the descriptions emphasize the Azores as a foreign region in some contexts, this likely reflects its status as a geographically distinct and isolated location within broader regional classifications. The archipelago’s unique insular ecosystem supports diverse biological distributions, making it a focal point for scientific research on species adaptation and biogeography. All four species mentioned—**Haematobia irritans**, **Bercaea cruentata**, **Helicophagella genus**, and the Sarcophagini group—underscore the Azores’ role as a critical habitat and reference point in ecological and taxonomic literature. The region’s Atlantic location and isolated nature contribute to its distinct biodiversity, which is studied to understand evolutionary patterns and species interactions in island ecosystems. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as they collectively reinforce the Azores’ significance as a hub for specific biological distributions and its inclusion in scientific frameworks for classification. The summary integrates all provided data, ensuring clarity and coherence while adhering to the third-person perspective and contextualizing the entity names. (Word count: 199)\",3\n1568,NEOTROPICAL,\"\n\nThe **Neotropical** region is a biogeographic area encompassing South and Central America, the Caribbean, and southern Mexico, characterized by its rich biodiversity and tropical/subtropical ecosystems. It is a key distribution zone for several species, including **Haematobia irritans** (the horn fly) and **Fannia scalaris** (a species of fly). **Haematobia irritans**, a hematophagous fly known for its parasitic behavior on cattle and other livestock, is widely present in the Neotropical realm, where its life cycle and ecological interactions are influenced by the region’s warm climates and agricultural practices. Similarly, **Fannia scalaris** is documented as being distributed within the Neotropical region, though its specific ecological role or habitat preferences are not detailed in the provided data. The Neotropical region’s status as a hotspot for diverse insect populations underscores its importance in supporting these species, which may contribute to local ecosystems or pose challenges for agriculture and public health. While the descriptions confirm the region’s role as a shared habitat for both species, no further details about their coexistence, population dynamics, or regional variations are provided. The Neotropical region remains a critical area for studying the distribution and adaptation of such organisms in response to environmental and anthropogenic factors.\",3\n2472,NORTHAFRICAN,,2\n2467,AUSTRALIAN,\"\n\nThe **AUSTRALIAN** biogeographic region, also referred to as the **澳洲区** in Chinese, is a distinct ecological and geographical area characterized by its unique assemblage of flora and fauna. This region is part of the broader biogeographic classification system used to categorize the Earth's ecosystems based on shared biological and environmental traits. The Australian region encompasses mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and surrounding islands, forming a hotspot for endemic species due to its long-term isolation and diverse habitats, including arid deserts, tropical rainforests, and coastal ecosystems.  \n\nOne notable species associated with this region is **Haematobia irritans**, commonly known as the horn fly. This hematophagous (blood-feeding) insect is distributed within the Australian biogeographic region, where it is recognized as a significant pest affecting livestock, particularly cattle. *Haematobia irritans* is known for its persistent behavior, attaching to hosts for extended periods and feeding multiple times daily, which can lead to reduced animal productivity, weight loss, and economic losses for agricultural industries. The fly's presence in the Australian region aligns with its global distribution, as it is also found in the Neotropical, Afrotropical, and Oriental regions, though its adaptation to the Australian environment highlights the region's role in supporting diverse insect populations.  \n\nThe Australian biogeographic region is further distinguished by its evolutionary history, which has fostered high levels of endemism. Many species within this region, such as marsupials (e.g., kangaroos, koalas) and monotremes (e.g., platypus), are found nowhere else on Earth. However, the introduction of non-native species like *Haematobia irritans* underscores the region's vulnerability to invasive organisms, which can disrupt native ecosystems and agricultural systems. Conservation efforts in the Australian region often focus on balancing the protection of endemic biodiversity with managing introduced species that pose ecological or economic threats.  \n\nIn summary, the **AUSTRALIAN** biogeographic region (澳洲区) is a geographically and ecologically unique area with a rich array of native species, including the invasive *Haematobia irritans*, which is distributed there and impacts livestock. Its isolation has shaped its distinct biological identity, while human activity and climate factors continue to influence its ecological dynamics.

Adults feed on cattle blood\",12\n1635,WESTWOOD,\"\n\n**WESTWOOD** (John Obadiah Westwood) was a prominent 19th-century British entomologist known for his significant contributions to the taxonomy and classification of insects. He is most notably associated with the genus *Haematobia*, which he described in 1840, marking a key milestone in his work on dipteran insects. Additionally, Westwood authored the introduction to a foundational classification system for insects, a work that was later cited in the scientific literature for the species *Coelomyia mollissima*. His expertise in insect morphology and systematics earned him recognition as a leading figure in early entomological studies. Westwood’s efforts in organizing and naming insect species helped standardize the field during a period of rapid biological discovery, influencing subsequent generations of taxonomists. Both the *Haematobia* genus and the classification framework he introduced remain relevant in entomological research, underscoring his lasting impact on the discipline.\",2\n1161,NEARCTIC,\"\n\nThe Nearctic is a biogeographic region that encompasses most of North America, including the Arctic tundra, boreal forests, and temperate zones extending from northern Canada and Alaska to the central and southern United States, as well as parts of northern Mexico. It is one of the eight major biogeographic realms and is characterized by its distinct ecological and climatic conditions, which have shaped the distribution of its flora and fauna. The Nearctic region is part of the larger Holarctic realm, which also includes the Palearctic region of Eurasia, and it shares many species with this broader area due to historical land connections.  \n\nTwo specific entities associated with the Nearctic are the horn fly (*Haematobia irritans*) and the genus *Pseudomyopina*. *Haematobia irritans*, a hematophagous fly known for its parasitic behavior on cattle and other livestock, is native to and widely distributed within the Nearctic. Its presence in this region is linked to the agricultural and ecological systems of North America, where it thrives in temperate climates and has become a significant pest in farming communities. Similarly, *Pseudomyopina*, a group of insects (likely within the order Diptera, given the context), is also found in the Nearctic, indicating the region's role as a key habitat for these species.  \n\nThe Nearctic's biodiversity is influenced by its varied ecosystems, ranging from arid deserts in the southwest to dense forests in the east and north. This diversity supports a wide array of insect species, including those like *Haematobia irritans* and *Pseudomyopina*, which have adapted to the region's environmental conditions. While the descriptions provided do not conflict, they highlight the region's importance as a shared biogeographic zone for these two entities. Further ecological studies might explore the interactions between such species and their roles in the Nearctic's ecosystems, particularly in agricultural contexts where *Haematobia irritans* is a notable concern.  \n\nIn summary, the Nearctic biogeographic region serves as a critical habitat for *Haematobia irritans* and *Pseudomyopina*, reflecting its ecological significance in North America. Its geographical and climatic diversity underpins the distribution of these species, aligning with broader patterns of Holarctic biogeography.\",4\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4285,HAEMATOBIA IRRITANS,LINNAEUS,Linnaeus described Haematobia irritans in 1758,47\n4295,HAEMATOBIA IRRITANS,AZORES,Haematobia irritans is distributed in Azores,19\n2513,FANNIA SCALARIS,NEOTROPICAL,Fannia scalaris is distributed in the Neotropical region,18\n4294,HAEMATOBIA IRRITANS,NORTHAFRICAN,Haematobia irritans is distributed in North Africa,18\n4298,HAEMATOBIA IRRITANS,AUSTRALIAN,Haematobia irritans is distributed in Australian region,18\n4300,HAEMATOBIA IRRITANS,FRESH DUNG,Haematobia irritans females lay eggs on fresh dung,17\n4301,HAEMATOBIA EXIGUA,DE MEIJERE,de Meijere described Haematobia exigua in 1903,16\n2685,COELOMYIA MOLLISIMA,WESTWOOD,Westwood's work is cited for Coelomyia mollissima,12\n1612,NEARCTIC,PSEUDOMYOPINA,Pseudomyopina is distributed in the Nearctic region,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
