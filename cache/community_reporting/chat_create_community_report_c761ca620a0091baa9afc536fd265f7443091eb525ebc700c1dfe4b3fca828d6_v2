Cragg co-authored the taxonomic description of *Musca bezzii*, also known as the \"\"北栖家蝇\"\" (Chinese: *Musca bezzii*), alongside Patton, as documented in the *Indian Journal of Medical Research* (Ind. Journ. Med. Res.). This species is a member of the *Musca* genus, which includes common houseflies. In the same year, Cragg also served as a co-author in the description of *Musca gibsoni*, another species within the same genus, though the specific journal or collaborator for this work is not explicitly named in the provided data. The 1913 publications highlight Cragg's contributions to entomological taxonomy, particularly in the classification of medically or ecologically significant fly species. While the descriptions of *Musca bezzii* and *Musca gibsoni* are both attributed to Cragg’s collaborative efforts in 1913, the *Indian Journal of Medical Research* is specifically linked to the *Musca bezzii* work, indicating its relevance to public health or medical research contexts. Cragg’s role as a co-author suggests involvement in fieldwork, morphological analysis, or scholarly writing, though further details about their individual contributions or the broader scientific impact of these descriptions remain unspecified in the data. The consistency of the 1913 timeline across all references confirms the historical context of Cragg’s work, while the mention of Patton as a collaborator for *Musca bezzii* adds specificity to the partnership. Together, these records establish Cragg as a contributor to early 20th-century entomological studies, with a focus on *Musca* species that may have implications for disease transmission or ecological studies. The absence of conflicting information in the descriptions allows for a unified account of Cragg’s scientific activities during this period.\",4\n2223,北栖家蝇,,3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3806,\"K, SVENSKA FREGETTEN EUGENIES RESA\",FAN,\"Fan described Musca (Viviparomusca) formosana in the publication K, svenska Fregatten Eugenies Resa\",304\n3738,CRAGG,北栖家蝇,Cragg 与 Patton 共同描述了北栖家蝇,7\n3735,SUEZ,北栖家蝇,苏联是北栖家蝇的国外分布区域,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
