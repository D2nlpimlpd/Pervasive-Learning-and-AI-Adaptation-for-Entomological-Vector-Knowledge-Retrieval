Spanning diverse geographical areas such as Siberia, the Ural Mountains, the Far East, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the European part of the country, the Soviet Union hosted a wide array of taxa. Among the species documented in its territories were **Macronychia striginervis** and **Macronychia polyodon**, as well as **Pseudocoenosia fletcheri**, which extended internationally to regions like Siberia and the Ural Mountains. The **Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia** and **Robineauella scoparia** were also recorded, with the latter covering the Soviet Union’s European part, Turkestan, Siberia, the Far East, the Ussuri border, and Sakhalin Island.  \n\nMultiple **Helina** species, including *Helina confinis* (Far East), *Helina cothurnata*, *Helina latitarsis*, *Helina parcepilosa*, *Helina obscuratoides*, *Helina lasiophthalma*, and *Helina punctifemoralis*, were distributed across the Soviet Union’s European, Siberian, and Central Asian regions. The country was also home to **Parasarcophaga** species such as *Parasarcophaga pleskei*, *Parasarcophaga portschinskyi*, and *Parasarcophaga emdeni*, alongside **Phaonia** species like *Phaonia fuscata* (Far East, Western Siberia, Tajikistan, and northern/central Europe), *Phaonia hybrida*, *Phaonia malaisei*, *Phaonia asierrans*, *Phaonia luteovittata*, and *Phaonia nigripennis*. **Strobilomyia** species, including *Strobilomyia laricicola* (Siberia), and **Oestrus** and **Oestromyia** genera (Central Asia, southern Europe, and the Far East) were also noted.  \n\nThe Soviet Union’s regions, such as Krasnovodsk, Chiva, and the Far East’s Primorsky Krai, supported species like **Senotainia deserta**, **Apodacra**, **Miltogrammoides**, **Gymnadichosia pusilla**, **Pollenomyia sinensis**, and **Pollenomyia okazakii**. **Tachina albidopilosa** and **Tachina nupta** were found internationally within the country, while **Servillia ardens** and **Scathophaga suilla** (including *mellipes*) were documented in the Far East and Eastern Siberia. **Protophormia terraenovae** and **Phormia regina** were present in European, Siberian, and Transbaikal regions, and **Phaonia pallidisquama**, **Phaonia consobrina**, and **Phaonia villana** were part of its international distribution records.  \n\nChinese-named species such as **1279膨端折麻蝇**, **1280钩阳折麻蝇**, **1281毛股折麻蝇**, **1396犁头亚麻蝇**, **1398拟对岛亚麻蝇**, and **古北蝗蝇** (Kazakhstan) were also reported. The country’s biodiversity included **Musca larvipara**, **Musca sorbens**, and **Musca crassirostris**, with the former’s life cycle studied in the region. **Lispe** species like *Lispe frigida* (Siberia), *Lispe odessae* (Odessa), and *Lispe leucospila* were documented, as were **Fannia prisca**, **Fannia canicularis**, and **Fannia kowarzi**.  \n\nThe Soviet Union played a role in the taxonomy and research of species such as **Sarcorohdendorfia antilope**, **Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi** (type locality in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan), and **Protocalliphora lii**, with contributions from scientists like *K.Б. Борнцова-Эннинова* (research on *Holotrichia diomphalia*). Genera like **Adia**, **Sinonipponia**, **Egle muscaria**, **Drymeia vicana**, and **Paregle aterrima** (Tajikistan) were also associated with its territories.  \n\nIn summary, the Soviet Union, as a former country, was a critical hub for the distribution of diverse fly species and genera, spanning its vast regions from the European territories to Central Asia and the Far East. Its ecological and geographical diversity supported both native and internationally documented species, with historical research and taxonomic records underscoring its importance in entomological studies.
