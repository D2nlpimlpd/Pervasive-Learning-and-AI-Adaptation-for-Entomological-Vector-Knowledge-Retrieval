It is recognized as a significant geographical and ecological site, particularly for its role in the distribution of the newly described plant species *Polleniopsis deqingensis*. This species, a member of the genus *Polleniopsis*, is endemic to the region and highlights the area's biodiversity and importance as a center for botanical research. The mountain range is part of the broader Hengduan Mountains system, a region renowned for its rich flora and fauna due to its complex topography and diverse microclimates.  \n\nAdditionally, Meili Snow Mountain serves as the **type locality** for *Drymeia midtibia*, a species of fly within the family Muscidae. The designation of a type locality is critical in taxonomy, as it establishes the reference point for the species' original description and classification. The presence of *Drymeia midtibia* in this area further underscores the ecological significance of Meili Snow Mountain, which supports a variety of specialized and potentially unique organisms.  \n\nThe mountain range is characterized by its alpine environment, with snow-capped peaks and high-altitude ecosystems that contribute to its status as a biodiversity hotspot. Its association with both *Polleniopsis deqingensis* and *Drymeia midtibia* illustrates the interconnectedness of species and their habitats in Yunnan, a province known for its conservation importance. While the descriptions provided focus on specific taxonomic associations, they collectively emphasize Meili Snow Mountain's role as a key location for scientific study and its value in understanding regional ecological dynamics.  \n\nNo contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as both align in identifying Meili Snow Mountain as a site of biological and geographical interest in Yunnan.
