Active from at least 1916 to 1948, Seguy is best known for his work on flies, including the establishment of the genus *Pollenomyia* in 1935 and the description of its type species. He described multiple species across different genera and families, such as *Meliniella griseifrons* (1923), *Delia echinata* (1923), *Eustalomyia lepraota* (1928), and the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly (1928). In 1932, he authored *Gymnodia spilogaster*, later recognized as a synonym of *Brontaea tonitrui*. His 1934 publications include *Isomyia oestracea* in *Encycl. Ent.*, *Bellardia menechma*, and *Lucilia (Luciliella) bazini*. Additionally, he described *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) koulingiana* in 1941 and *Calliphora axata* in 1946, the latter of which is a species of blowfly. Seguy also contributed to the taxonomy of *Limnophora*, authoring *Limnophora pandellei* (1946), a synonym for *Limnophora orbitalis*. Notably, he described *Caiusa coomani* in 1948, a species later referred to as the Vietnam jewel fly, and *Isomyia isomyia* in 1946, further expanding his work on the *Isomyia* genus. His 1916 description of *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) chini* and 1935 work on *Nystomyia* in *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.* highlight his long-standing engagement with fly taxonomy. Seguy’s research was cited in studies related to Laos in 1946 and referenced in the description of the Scathophagidae family (粪蝇科) in figure A40. His career spanned both foundational taxonomic work and the establishment of new genera, reflecting a broad expertise in entomology. Despite some species being later synonymized or reclassified, his contributions remain critical to the understanding of dipteran biodiversity, particularly in Southeast Asia. Seguy’s legacy is preserved through his meticulous descriptions and the enduring use of his names in scientific literature.\",20\n4068,BROAD-FACED GREENBOTTLE FLY,\"A species of blowfly (Chrysomya (Compsomyia) phaonis) with features like a white or dirty white upper arista when wings are folded, and a distribution in China (Hebei, Beijing, Inner Mongolia, etc.) and abroad (India, Afghanistan).
