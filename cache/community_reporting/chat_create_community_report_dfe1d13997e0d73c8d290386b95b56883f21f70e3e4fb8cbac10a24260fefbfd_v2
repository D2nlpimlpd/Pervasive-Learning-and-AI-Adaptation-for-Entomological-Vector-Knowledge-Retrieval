It has documented numerous species across diverse fly families, including parasitic flies, and is recognized for its contributions to entomological science in China. The journal has published descriptions of species such as *Egle rectapica* and *Egle cyrtapica*, as well as *Protomiltogramma yunnanense* (described in issue 24(3):314, figures 5–10, under the genus *Pterella*). It has also featured studies on parasitic flies like *Blepharipa tibialis* and *Drymeia xinjiangensis*, alongside *Xestomyia hirtifemur*. \n\nTaxonomic work on the genus *Pegomya* is prominently highlighted, with the journal publishing descriptions of *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Pegomya hamatacrophalla*, *Pegomya angusticerca*, *Pegomya simpliciforceps*, *Pegomya flaviprecoxa*, *Pegomya dichaetomyiola*, *Pegomya folifera*, *Pegomya melatrochanter*, *Pegomya crinisternita*, and *Pegomya tenuiramula*. For the genus *Phaonia*, it has documented species such as *Phaonia bitrigona*, *Phaonia nigrigenis*, *Phaonia qingheensis*, and *Phaonia fissa*, with specific mentions of *Phaonia huanrenensis* described in 1984. The journal also includes studies on *Bellardia* species, such as *Bellardia micromenechma* and *Bellardia notomenechma* (described in 1986 by Liang and Gan), and *Servillia planiforceps*. \n\nAdditional species documented in the journal include *Heteronychia macromembrana* (1980), *Syllegopterula flava* (with a reference correction to remove an extraneous parenthesis), *Dinemomyia nigribasicosta* (described by Chen in 1975), and *1355 Small Gray Pierretia Fly*. It has also published works on *Alliopsis* species, *1278靴折麻蝇* (Servaisia species in issue 21(2):185), and *1966 study on fly larvae* by Meng Xianqin. The journal’s 1981 issue (volume 24, issue 3, pages 314–315) includes the description of *Tibetan Tuberomembrana*, and it has been a venue for documenting new *Helina* species and their Chinese distributions. \n\nThe journal is written in Chinese (its full title is *昆虫学报*) and has been cited in multiple contexts, including taxonomic classifications and ecological research. Its publications span decades, with notable contributions in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and it continues to serve as a critical resource for entomologists studying Chinese insect biodiversity. The journal’s role in describing and classifying species like *Burmanomyia beesoni* and *Atherigona* (e.g., pages 4(1–2):8–9, figures 1–5, 6–10, 21–26, 32–36) further underscores its importance in regional entomology. \n\nIn summary, *Acta Entomologica Sinica* is a multidisciplinary Chinese journal that has systematically advanced the understanding of fly taxonomy, ecology, and distribution, with a focus on species native to China.
