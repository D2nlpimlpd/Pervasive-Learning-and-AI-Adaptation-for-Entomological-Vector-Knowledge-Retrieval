It is found in Shaanxi, Qinghai, Tibet, Sichuan, Henan, and the type locality Qilian in Qinghai.\",7\n354,FAN,\"\n\nFAN is a Chinese entomologist and taxonomist whose work has profoundly advanced the classification and ecological understanding of Diptera (true flies), particularly in China. Their research spans multiple genera and subgenera, including *Pegomya*, *Drymeia*, *Phaonia*, *Syngamoptera*, *Delia*, *Lispe*, *Hylemya*, *Craspedochoeta*, and others, with significant contributions to journals such as *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, *昆虫学研究集刊* (Insect Research Journal), and *动物学研究* (Zoological Research). FAN is credited with establishing the **Blaesoxiphini tribe** in 1965 and co-establishing the subgenus **Apicamplexa** with Qian. They described the genus *Sinochirosia* in 1982 and *Burmanomyia* in 1964, while also co-describing *Alliopsis* and *Alisarcophaga* genera. Notably, FAN introduced *Tuberomembrana* in 1981 and *Xenotachina* (as \"\"sp. n.\"\" in texts), alongside species like *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (1965) and *Dexopollenia uniseta* (1988).  \n\nFAN’s species descriptions are extensive and temporally diverse. In 1964, they described *Heteronychia quoi*. By 1965, their work included *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) shenyangensis*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) hainanensis*, *Musca pilifacies*, *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Protomiltogramma yunnanense*, *Syngamoptera gigas*, and the Chinese flat-headed fly *Catapicephala sinica*. In 1974, they described *Coelomyia ctenophora*. Collaborative efforts with colleagues like Qian, Fang, and Chen further expanded their impact, resulting in co-authored works such as *Isomyia latimarginata* and *Isomyia viridiscutellata* (1986), *Isomyia xishuangensis* and *Isomyia pentochaeta* (1986), *Nupedia henanensis*, *Enneastigma shanghaiensis*, and *Enneastigma pilosiventrosa* (with Chen), as well as *Paraprosalpia lutebasicosta* and *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae* (1983). Their 1984 publications added *Drymeia yadongensis*, *Craspedochoeta pullulula*, and *Syngamoptera unilineata*, while 1988 saw the description of *Pegohylemyia mediospicula* (拟山字泉种蝇), *Pegohylemyia qinghaisenecio* (青泽菊泉种蝇), and *Adia grisella asiatica*. Subspecies attributed to FAN include *Mesembrina montana asternopleuralis* (1965) and *Miltogramma ibericum brachygonitum* (1965).  \n\nFAN’s research also includes ecological studies, such as a 1959 paper on larval development in human feces, and contributions to domestic distribution data of Chinese fly species. They described several *Polleniopsis* species, including *Polleniopsis lata*, *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, and *Polleniopsis yunnanensis* (1988). Their legacy is marked by naming conventions like *Sinolucilia* (1965) and *Sinochirosia* (1982), as well as foundational work in dipteran taxonomy across Asia. Collaborations with Qian, Fang, and Chen yielded additional genera and species, such as *Pierretia bihami* (1981) and *Ceylonomyia taiwanensis* (1981).  \n\nIn summary, FAN’s career as a taxonomist and entomologist is defined by meticulous morphological classification, ecological insights, and extensive collaboration. Their descriptions of species like *Coelomyia ctenophora*, *Heteronychia quoi*, and *Catapicephala sinica*, along with the establishment of tribes and subgenera, have solidified their role as a pivotal figure in the study of Chinese and Asian fly fauna. Their work remains a cornerstone for dipteran taxonomy, emphasizing biodiversity and systematic research in the region.

It is recognized as a sub-tribe within the larger tribe **Protodexiini**, which itself belongs to the family Tachinidae, a group of parasitoid flies. The tribe BLAESOXIPHINI is specifically defined by its inclusion of the genus **Blaesoxipha**, which is the sole representative attributed to this taxonomic group. Fan’s original work in 1965 introduced the tribe to classify and organize species within the Protodexiini framework, emphasizing distinct morphological or ecological characteristics that differentiate Blaesoxipha from other genera in the broader tribe. While the primary description highlights its establishment and the genus it contains, the secondary context situates it hierarchically within Protodexiini, clarifying its placement in the tachinid classification system. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the authorship (Fan, 1965), the tribe’s name, and its taxonomic scope. The summary integrates these details to reflect its role as a specialized sub-group within Protodexiini, centered on the genus Blaesoxipha. This tribe is significant for its contribution to the systematic study of tachinid flies, particularly in delineating evolutionary or ecological relationships among related genera.
