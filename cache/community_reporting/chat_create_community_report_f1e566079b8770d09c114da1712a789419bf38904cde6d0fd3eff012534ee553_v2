It serves as a key domestic location for multiple genera and species, including **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Eutrichota inornata**, **Helina calceataeformis**, **Helina quadrum**, **Lydella grisescens**, **Phryxe vulgaris**, **Musca autumnalis**, **Platymyia hortulana**, **Zenillia dolosa**, **Limnophora triangula**, **Nupedia aestiva**, **Nupedia patellans**, **Nupedia infirma**, and the genus **Adia**. Specific regions within Shanxi, such as the **Yanbei region**, **Changzhi**, **Taiyuan**, and **Lin County**, are highlighted for their unique species occurrences, including **614裸蹠芒蝇 (614 Nudipedis芒蝇)**, **类绒粪泉蝇 (Leucophora shanxiensis)**, and **蓝黑栉寄蝇 (Pales pavida)**.  \n\nThe province hosts multiple **Helina** species, such as **Helina hirtifemorata**, **Helina hengshanensis**, and **Helina obscuratoides**, alongside **Phaonia** species like **Phaonia datongensis**, **Phaonia submontana**, **Phaonia xingxianensis**, **Phaonia wenshuiensis**, **Phaonia yanggaoensis**, **Phaonia xiangningensis**, **Phaonia youyuensis**, **Phaonia fuscata**, and **Phaonia longifurca**. Notable species with type localities in Shanxi include **Egle cyrtacra** (Jinci, Taiyuan) and **Phorbia securis xibeina** (Nanmewan, Yan’an). Other recorded species are **Calliphora axata** (Hanzhong), **Calliphora nigribarbis**, **Chionomyia vetula**, **Coenosia dilatitarsis**, **Coenosia mollicula**, **Coenosia incisurata**, **Coenosia strigipes**, **Graphomya rufitibia** (Hanzhong), **Lispe monochaita**, **Lispe loewi**, **Paraprosalpia tibialis**, **Parasarcophaga polystylata**, **Servaisia rossica**, **Sarcophaga erythrura**, **Hydrotaea bimaculatoides**, **Hydrotaea occulta**, **Hydrophoria megaloba**, **Musca bezzii**, **Musca conducens**, **Musca tempestiva**, **Muscina assimilis** (Xingxian), **Haematobia**, **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, **Cynomyiomima stackelbergi**, **Pseudonupedia intersecta** (Taiyuan), **Leydella dorsalis** (Taiyuan), **Pegomya esuriens**, **Cynomya mortuorum**, **Mydaea discimana**, **Mydaea laxidetrita**, **Fannia similis**, **Fannia scalaris**, **Hebecnema alba**, **Stomorhina obsoleta**, **Xenotachina fumifemoralis**, and **Voria ruralis**.  \n\nShanxi is also associated with species such as **1278靴折麻蝇 (1278 Boot-folded芒蝇)**, **1279膨端折麻蝇 (1279 Swollen-end-folded芒蝇)**, **1351 Microspine Pierretia Fly**, **SHUANG YANGYING**, **732 HEYUAN HUI FLY**, **毛踝厕蝇 (Hairy-ankle厕蝇)**, and **溪口厕蝇 (Xikou厕蝇)**. The province’s ecological significance is underscored by its role in entomological surveys, including those conducted by the **Shanxi Medical College**, and its inclusion in studies of genera like **Hoa**, **Gonia picea**, and **Calythea cheni**.  \n\nWhile some descriptions mistakenly reference \"\"Shaanxi,\"\" all confirmed records pertain to **Shanxi**, a distinct northern Chinese province. Key cities and regions within Shanxi, such as **Xi’an**, **Ankang**, **Yan’an**, **Yulin**, **Dingbian**, and **Zhongnan Mountain**, are noted for their contributions to the distribution of species like **Phormia regina** (Xi’an), **Dolichocolon klapperichi**, and **Paregle densibarbata**. The province’s biodiversity is further enriched by species like **Anthomyia procellaris**, **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, and **Kramerea schuetzei**, with specific habitats including **Nanmifan**, **Huanglongshan**, and **Qinling**.  \n\nIn summary, Shanxi is a critical hub for fly species diversity in China, with documented distributions spanning over 50 species across its varied regions. Its ecological surveys and collections have provided valuable insights into genera such as **Phaonia**, **Helina**, and **Lydella**, solidifying its role in entomological research. The province’s northern location and distinct habitats contribute to the presence of both common and rare species, making it a focal area for biodiversity studies.
