Active in both taxonomic research and ecological documentation, KANO's work spans multiple regions, including Japan, Micronesia, and Taiwan, and involves collaborations with other scientists. Their earliest recorded contribution dates to 1950, when they described the species *拟野亚麻蝇* (likely *Ph. fuscitibia* or a related *Phaonia* species). In 1953 and 1954, KANO authored multiple references to *1339上海细麻蝇* (possibly *Ph. xanthofemina*), and in 1956, they co-described *Sarcophaga furutonensis* with Okazaki and *Sarcophaga shiroganensis* with another collaborator.  \n\nKANO's 1960s work includes foundational studies on the genus *Xanthotryxus* in 1968, as well as co-authoring a 1968 study on fly species characteristics referenced in broader literature. They were also involved in documenting the distribution of flies in Micronesia in 1968, alongside other researchers. Notably, KANO described the species *Melinda itoi* in 1962 and co-authored a 1968 study on *Melinda* species. In 1964, they co-described *Robineauella (D.) uemotoi*, and in 1966, they contributed to the description of *Protocalliphora maruyamensis*. Additionally, KANO is cited as an author for the type locality of *Brontaea ezensis* and for studies on *Phaonia bambusa*, *Phaonia luteovittata*, and *Phaonia ryukyuensis*.  \n\nThe 1970s saw KANO's continued focus on taxonomic classifications, including co-establishing the *Horia* genus in 1967 and studying the genus *Neomyia* in 1973. They also co-described *Sarcosolomonia harinasutai* in 1977 and *Ophyra okazakii* in 1971. In 1973, KANO was associated with a report on fly species, and their work on *Stomoxys uruma* (co-described with Shinonaga in 1966) and *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Paradichosia tsukamotoi* further highlights their expertise in dipteran taxonomy.  \n\nKANO's research also extended to the 1980s, with studies on species differences in 1983 and 1987. They were cited for specimen collection in Japan and for the distribution of *Pyrellia cyanicolor* in Taiwan. Their collaborations often involved prominent entomologists, as seen in co-authoring works on *Gymnadichosia pusilla* and *Pollenomyia okazakii*.  \n\nOverall, KANO's career reflects a deep engagement with the taxonomy and ecology of flies, particularly within the *Phaonia*, *Melinda*, and *Sarcophaga* genera. Their work, frequently collaborative, advanced the understanding of species distribution, morphological characteristics, and regional biodiversity in Asia. Key publications include studies on *Xanthotryxus* (1968), *Horia* (1967), and multiple *Phaonia* species, alongside contributions to the classification of *Stomoxys uruma* and *Ophyra okazakii*. KANO's legacy is marked by meticulous documentation and the establishment of new taxonomic frameworks, solidifying their role as a pivotal figure in entomological research during the 20th century.\",29\n1745,SHINONAGA,\"\n\nSHINONAGA, a Japanese entomologist, is recognized for his significant contributions to the taxonomy and distribution studies of dipteran species, particularly flies, across Asia and the Pacific. His work spans multiple decades, with notable publications beginning in 1966. In that year, he co-authored the description of *Protocalliphora maruyamensis* and, alongside Kano, described *Stomoxys uruma*. By 1968, Shinonaga was actively involved in documenting the distribution of flies in Micronesia, collaborating with Kano on a study of *Melinda* species and contributing to a broader 1968 report on fly species characteristics. He also co-authored the 1968 documentation of *Neomyia indica* in Thailand and was cited for specimen collection in Japan.  \n\nIn 1969, Shinonaga expanded his research to include the study of *Iranihindia*, a genus of flies. The following year, 1970, marked his description of *Neomyia ruficornis*, further solidifying his expertise in the *Neomyia* genus. In 1973, he co-authored a fly species report and conducted a detailed study of the *Neomyia* genus, demonstrating his ongoing focus on this group. His 1979 work was particularly prolific: he proposed the synonymy of *Pierretia melania* for *Dinemomyia nigribasicosta*, co-established the genus *Kanomyia*, and described the genus *Hosarcophaga*. Additionally, he co-described *Huckettomyia watanabei* and *Megophyra simpliceps*, and was associated with the species *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Paradichosia tsukamotoi*.  \n\nShinonaga’s taxonomic contributions include the description of several species, such as *Phaonia bambusa*, *Phaonia fuscitibia*, *Phaonia ryukyuensis*, and *Ophyra okazakii*, as well as the genus *Xanthotryxus* in 1968. He also provided the type locality for *Brontaea ezensis*, a critical detail for its classification. His collaborative efforts, particularly with Kano, were instrumental in advancing the understanding of fly biodiversity in regions like Japan, Micronesia, and Taiwan, as evidenced by his co-authorship on the 1966 *Protocalliphora maruyamensis* and 1968 *Melinda* species studies.  \n\nShinonaga’s work reflects a multidisciplinary approach, addressing both regional distribution patterns and morphological characteristics of dipteran taxa. His research on *Tricholioproctia flavinervis* synonymy and *Pyrellia cyanicolor* in Taiwan highlights his role in clarifying taxonomic relationships and geographic ranges. Through these efforts, Shinonaga has left a lasting impact on the field of entomology, particularly in the systematic study of flies in East Asia and the Pacific. His publications remain foundational references for understanding the diversity and classification of these insects.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",25\n1837,\"JPN.JOURN,SANIT.ZOOL.\",The journal where Huckettomyia watanabei was described in 1970,2\n4280,\"BULL.
