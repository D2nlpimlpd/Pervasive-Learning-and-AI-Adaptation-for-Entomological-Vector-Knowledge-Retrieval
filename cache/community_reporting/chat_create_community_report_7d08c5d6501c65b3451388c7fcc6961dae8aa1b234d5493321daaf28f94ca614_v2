First described by the French entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1863, the genus is characterized by a distinctive flat occiput (the posterior part of the head) adorned with black bristles, a key morphological trait used for identification. BESSA species are primarily native to China, where they are most commonly encountered, but their distribution extends to other regions, including Europe, Siberia, and Japan. This geographic range suggests a degree of adaptability to diverse temperate and boreal climates. As members of the Exoristini tribe, BESSA flies likely exhibit ecological roles typical of tachinids, such as regulating populations of insect hosts through parasitism. The combination of their unique anatomical features and broad distribution highlights their significance in both taxonomic studies and ecological contexts. The genus remains a subject of interest for entomologists due to its morphological distinctiveness and the potential for further research into its life history, host interactions, and biogeographic patterns.
