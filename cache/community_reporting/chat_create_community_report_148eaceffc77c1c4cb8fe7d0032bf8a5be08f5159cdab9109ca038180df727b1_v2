The tribe is taxonomically significant as it encompasses a diverse array of genera, with notable examples including *Bessa*, *Parasetigena*, *Chaetexorista*, *Exorista*, *Austrophorocera*, and *Chetogena*. These genera are often highlighted in entomological studies for their roles in biological control and ecological interactions, particularly as parasitoids of other arthropods. A key to identifying the common genera within Exoristini is provided in the referenced text, aiding researchers and taxonomists in classification. Morphologically, members of this tribe typically exhibit features such as specific wing venation patterns, antennal structures, and body setae arrangements, though precise details of these traits may vary among the included genera. The placement of Exoristini within the Exoristinae subfamily underscores its evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships with other tachinid tribes, contributing to broader understanding of the family’s taxonomy. Despite its classification as a tribe, Exoristini remains a focal point for studies on tachinid diversity and functional morphology.\",6\n5412,EXORISTA,\"Exorista is a genus of tachinid flies described by Meigen in 1803, part of the Exoristini tribe, with specific morphological traits like a convex occiput and non-geniculate antennae\",2\n5409,PARASETIGENA,\"Parasetigena is a genus of tachinid flies described by Brauer et Bergenstamm in 1891, distinguished by a powdery abdomen with gray spots and specific wing venation features\",1\n5410,CHAETEXORISTA,\"Chaetexorista is a genus of tachinid flies described by Brauer-Bergenstamm in 1894, characterized by abdominal black bands and specific bristle patterns\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10380,EXORISTINI,BESSA,Bessa is a genus within the Exoristini tribe,17\n10394,EXORISTA,EXORISTINI,Exorista is a genus within the Exoristini tribe,8\n10392,PARASETIGENA,EXORISTINI,Parasetigena is a genus within the Exoristini tribe,7\n10393,CHAETEXORISTA,EXORISTINI,Chaetexorista is a genus within the Exoristini tribe,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
