It is also occasionally referred to as an area within Xinjiang, though the more precise designation is as a city. TACHENG is associated with two distinct species of flies in entomological contexts. The first is *Pollenia pseudo rudis*, a species linked to the region, while the second is *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, a fly belonging to the subgenus *Bufolucilia* within the genus *Lucilia*. These associations highlight TACHENG's relevance in studies of local biodiversity or ecological research, particularly in the field of dipteran taxonomy. The city’s location in Xinjiang, a region known for its diverse ecosystems and geographical features, may contribute to the presence or study of such species. While the descriptions provided do not clarify the specific ecological or research context of these associations, they collectively establish TACHENG as a geographical entity in Xinjiang with documented connections to these two fly species. The apparent contradiction between \"\"area\"\" and \"\"city\"\" is resolved by recognizing that TACHENG is a city, which may encompass broader regional references. This summary integrates all provided information to present a cohesive overview of TACHENG’s entomological significance.\",1\n3579,KASHGAR,\"City in Xinjiang, China, associated with *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*\",1\n2777,AKESU,\"\n\nAkesu is a city located in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. It is notable for its association with the species *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, a fly that has been documented in the region, likely due to its ecological or geographical relevance to the area. Additionally, Akesu is recognized as a location where *Lispe melaleuca*, a plant species, is distributed, indicating its presence in the local flora. These two distinct entities—*Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora* and *Lispe melaleuca*—are both linked to Akesu, highlighting the city's role as a site of biological interest for these specific organisms. The descriptions provided do not present contradictions, as they refer to separate species (one an insect, the other a plant) and their respective connections to the region. Akesu’s inclusion in both contexts underscores its ecological diversity or significance in scientific studies related to these taxa. The city’s geographical position in Xinjiang, a region known for its varied ecosystems and biodiversity, may contribute to the presence or study of such species. No further details about the nature of the association or distribution patterns are specified in the data, but the combined information establishes Akesu as a location tied to both entomological and botanical records. This synthesis ensures all provided data points are integrated into a coherent overview of the city’s relevance to these species.\",1\n799,SHAWAN,\"\n\n**SHAWAN** is a location in Xinjiang, China, associated with two distinct fly species: *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora* and *Hydrophoria pronata*. The first description highlights its connection to *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, a species within the genus *Lucilia* and subgenus *Bufolucilia*, which is likely a parasitic or scavenging fly given the naming conventions of the genus. The second description specifies that Shawan is also linked to *Hydrophoria pronata*, a species in the genus *Hydrophoria*, which is part of the family Calliphoridae (blowflies) and often associated with aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Both descriptions concur on the geographic location of Shawan in Xinjiang, China, but differ in the specific species cited. This suggests that Shawan may be a region of ecological or entomological significance, where multiple fly species, potentially with overlapping or distinct ecological roles, have been documented. The data does not indicate direct contradictions in the entity's identity or location but rather expands its biological associations. Further research or context would be needed to clarify the relationship between these species in the area, such as whether they coexist in the same ecosystems or are studied for different purposes (e.g., medical, agricultural, or forensic relevance). For now, the summary integrates both provided details to reflect Shawan's dual entomological connections.\",1\n3580,YINING RIVER VALLEY,\"Region in Xinjiang, China, associated with *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*\",1\n3581,\"XICHA RIVER, ALTAY\",\"Location in Xinjiang, China, associated with *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*\",1\n3582,AHEQI,\"Location in Xinjiang, China, associated with *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*\",1\n3587,SOUTHERN CANADA,,1\n2279,JINGHE,\"\n\nJINGHE is a county located in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China, recognized as a significant geographical and ecological site associated with the distribution and presence of several notable species. The area is home to *Lispe melaleuca*, a species of fly within the family Syrphidae, which is documented as being distributed in this region. Additionally, JINGHE is linked to *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, a blowfly species known for its association with toads, further highlighting the county's role in supporting diverse insect populations. The region also hosts *Dasyphora tianshanensis*, a bird species endemic to the Tianshan mountain range, which is found in the local habitats of JINGHE. These associations underscore the ecological importance of JINGHE as a location where unique and specialized organisms thrive, reflecting the broader biodiversity of Xinjiang. The convergence of these species in the county suggests a complex interplay of environmental conditions, such as altitude, climate, and vegetation, that sustain both avian and invertebrate life. While the descriptions do not explicitly detail the interactions between these species or their specific ecological roles, the shared geographical context of JINGHE implies a cohesive ecosystem that supports their coexistence. The county’s inclusion in scientific records for these species emphasizes its value for conservation and biological research, particularly in understanding the adaptations of organisms to the arid and mountainous landscapes of Xinjiang. Overall, JINGHE serves as a key reference point for studies on regional biodiversity, with its documented presence of *Lispe melaleuca*, *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, and *Dasyphora tianshanensis* contributing to the understanding of ecological dynamics in the area. The lack of conflicting information in the provided descriptions allows for a unified portrayal of JINGHE as a multifaceted location integral to the habitats of these distinct species.
