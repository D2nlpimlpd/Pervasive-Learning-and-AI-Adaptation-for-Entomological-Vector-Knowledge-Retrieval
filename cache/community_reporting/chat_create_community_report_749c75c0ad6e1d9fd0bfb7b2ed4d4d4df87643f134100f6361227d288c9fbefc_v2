It serves as a key distribution area for numerous dipteran genera and species, including **Musca** (e.g., *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, *Musca hervei*, *Musca conducens*, *Musca crassirostris*), **Isomyia** (e.g., *Isomyia quadrina*, *Isomyia viridiscutellata*, *I. divisa*, *I. tripartita*, *Isomyia nebulosa*, *Isomyia cupreoviridis*), and **Atherigona** (*Atherigona reversura*, *Atherigona triglomerata*). The province is also home to **Chrysomya** species such as *Chrysomya pinguis*, *Chrysomya megacephala*, and *Chrysomya bezziana*, with documented occurrences in cities like Baoqing, Yinggen, and Nada. Additionally, **Stomoxys** species (*Stomoxys sitiens*, *Stomoxys uruma*), **Bengalia** (*Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri*), and **Ceylonomyia** (*Ceylonomyia nigripes*) are reported in Hainan.  \n\nThe region hosts several endemic or locally significant species, including **611扁蹠芒蝇** (flat-padded tachinid fly) and **614裸蹠芒蝇** (bare-padded tachinid fly), as well as **PIERRETTIA OTIOPHALLA**, **PIERRETTIA ZHOUQUENSIS**, and **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**. Notably, **1399胡氏亚麻蝇** (Hu’s tachinid fly) is documented here, with Hainan serving as its type locality. Other species include **732 HEYUAN HUI FLY**, **Haematobia minuta**, **Parasarcophaga hui**, **Strongyloneura prasina**, **Lispe loewi**, **Anthomyia plumiseta**, **Achoetandrus rufifacies**, and **Silbomyia hoeneana**. The genus **Emmesomyia** is particularly well-represented, with species like *Emmesomyia megastigmata*, *Emmesomyia kemp*, **海南粪泉蝇** (Hainan dung fly), and **大孔粪泉蝇** (large-hole dung fly) found in the province.  \n\nHainan’s biodiversity is further highlighted by the presence of **Metoposisyrops scirpophagae** (Star Island Greenbottle Fly) and **Morellia hainanensis**, both of which are documented in the region. The province is also a domestic distribution site for **Musca sorbens** and **Rhinia apicalis**, with **Xinglong** and **Nada** frequently cited as sub-regions of occurrence. Specific locations such as **Dianluo**, **Baisha**, **Wuzhishan**, **Tongshi**, **Qiongzhong**, **Baoting**, and **Sanya** are associated with various species, including *Graphomya rufitibia* and *Hypopygiopsis infumata*.  \n\nResearch in Hainan has been conducted by entomologists like **ZHANG BAOLIN**, contributing to the understanding of its fly fauna. However, the province is explicitly noted as a region where **Calliphora vomitoria** is not reported, distinguishing it from other areas. The presence of **Carcelia kockiana**, **Cuphocera varia**, and **Alisarcophaga gressitti** further underscores its ecological diversity.  \n\nIn summary, Hainan is a critical hub for fly species in China, hosting a wide array of genera and species across its cities and natural regions. Its unique status as an island province, combined with specific sub-regions like Xinglong and Dianluo, supports a rich and varied dipteran population, making it a focal point for entomological studies. The data collectively emphasize Hainan’s role in the distribution of both common and specialized fly species, with some serving as type localities or regional endemics.\",79\n5073,PIERRETTIA ZHOUQUENSIS,\"A species of fly with a body length of 7.0 mm, distributed in China (Hainan, Ledong Jianfengling) and internationally in the Soviet Union (Far East, Caucasus, Ukraine, Russia).♂ specimens have a pair of small, membranous processes with petal-like lateral branches and slender, forward-curving abdominal setae.♀ characteristics are unknown.\",2\n2100,YINGGEN,\"Yinggen is a city in Hainan province, China\",1\n2101,TONGSHI,\"\n\nTONGSHI is a city located in Hainan province, China, and is recognized as a significant geographical entity within the region. It is specifically noted for its association with the distribution of certain species, including *611扁蹠芒蝇* (likely a species of fly, though the full scientific name is not provided) and *614裸蹠芒蝇* (another species, similarly unnamed in full). These species are part of the broader ecological context of Tongshi, which is described as a location where they are present. Additionally, Tongshi is identified as an area within Hainan where *Musca crassirostris*, a species of fly, is distributed. While some descriptions refer to Tongshi as a \"\"region\"\" or \"\"area,\"\" the most consistent and specific designation across the data is that it is a city in Hainan. This aligns with the administrative and geographical framework of Hainan, where cities and regions often overlap in classification. The mention of multiple species highlights Tongshi’s role as a habitat or study site for entomological research, particularly for these fly species. The data does not present direct contradictions but rather varying levels of specificity in describing Tongshi’s geographical and ecological significance. In summary, Tongshi is a city in Hainan, China, notable for its connection to the distribution of *611扁蹠芒蝇*, *614裸蹠芒蝇*, and *Musca crassirostris*, underscoring its importance in regional biodiversity studies. The entity’s dual characterization as both a city and a broader ecological area reflects its multifaceted relevance in scientific and administrative contexts.

It is recognized as a key location in the distribution range of several species, including the flies *611扁蹠芒蝇* (scientific name likely *Musca crassirostris* or a related species) and *614裸蹠芒蝇*. These species, part of the Muscidae family, are associated with the ecological and geographical characteristics of the Baoting area, which may include its tropical climate, biodiversity, or specific habitats. The city’s role in the distribution of *Musca crassirostris* further underscores its significance in regional entomological studies. While the descriptions emphasize Baoting’s connection to these species, they collectively confirm its status as a distinct administrative and geographical entity within Hainan. The city is likely part of a broader network of locations where these species thrive, contributing to local ecological dynamics. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions align on Baoting’s identity as a Hainan-based location linked to the mentioned species. The summary integrates the entity’s administrative classification (city/region) and its biological relevance, ensuring coherence and completeness.\",1\n2103,BAISHA,\"\n\n**BAISHA** is a location situated in Hainan province, China, and is recognized as part of the geographical distribution range of the species *Musca crassirostris*. While one description refers to it as a \"\"city,\"\" this likely reflects a broader or colloquial understanding of the term, as Hainan is home to several administrative divisions, including cities like Sanya and Haikou, but Baisha itself is more accurately characterized as a district or town within the province. Its significance lies in its ecological relevance to *Musca crassirostris*, a species of fly whose habitat and range are studied in entomological contexts. The mention of Baisha in relation to this species highlights its role as a regional point of interest for biodiversity research, though no further details about the local environment or specific studies conducted there are provided in the data.
