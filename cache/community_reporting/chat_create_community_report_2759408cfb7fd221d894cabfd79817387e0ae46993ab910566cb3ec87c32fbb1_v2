The country’s biodiversity included **Musca larvipara**, **Musca sorbens**, and **Musca crassirostris**, with the former’s life cycle studied in the region. **Lispe** species like *Lispe frigida* (Siberia), *Lispe odessae* (Odessa), and *Lispe leucospila* were documented, as were **Fannia prisca**, **Fannia canicularis**, and **Fannia kowarzi**.  \n\nThe Soviet Union played a role in the taxonomy and research of species such as **Sarcorohdendorfia antilope**, **Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi** (type locality in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan), and **Protocalliphora lii**, with contributions from scientists like *K.Б. Борнцова-Эннинова* (research on *Holotrichia diomphalia*). Genera like **Adia**, **Sinonipponia**, **Egle muscaria**, **Drymeia vicana**, and **Paregle aterrima** (Tajikistan) were also associated with its territories.  \n\nIn summary, the Soviet Union, as a former country, was a critical hub for the distribution of diverse fly species and genera, spanning its vast regions from the European territories to Central Asia and the Far East. Its ecological and geographical diversity supported both native and internationally documented species, with historical research and taxonomic records underscoring its importance in entomological studies. (499 words)\",127\n604,ZONOVA,\"\n\nZONOVA was a researcher who, in 1935, documented the host plant interactions of *Strobilomyia* species in Siberia. Their work is closely associated with the 1935 Siberian records of these species' host plants, contributing to the understanding of their ecological relationships. The descriptions provided align in identifying Zonova as a key figure in this early entomological study, emphasizing their role in cataloging the specific plants on which *Strobilomyia* species were observed to interact. This research likely involved field observations and systematic analysis of the insects' feeding, reproduction, or habitat preferences in relation to their host flora. While the details of the methodology or findings are not explicitly outlined in the given data, the association with Siberian records from that year highlights the historical and geographical significance of their contributions. Zonova’s documentation remains a reference point for studies on *Strobilomyia* and its ecological niche in the region.\",2\n5284,PARASARCOPHAGA UNGUITIGRIS,A fly species described by Rohdendorf (1938) with unique tail structures and distribution in China and the Soviet Union,4\n79,LATE PROF.

It has served as a platform for documenting and describing various species, including *Calythea limnophorina* and *Polietes hirticrura*. The journal’s role in entomological research is highlighted by its historical contributions, such as the formal description of *Polietes hirticrura* in 1887, which underscores its significance in the taxonomy and classification of insect species. While the specific context of *Calythea limnophorina*’s documentation in the journal is not detailed, the inclusion of this species alongside *Polietes hirticrura* suggests that ENT.MON.MAG. has been a repository for diverse entomological findings. The journal’s monthly publication format likely facilitated timely dissemination of discoveries, supporting ongoing scientific discourse in the field. ENT.MON.MAG. appears to have been a key resource for entomologists, providing a record of both well-known and newly identified species, though its scope and other documented taxa remain unspecified in the provided data. The combination of these references establishes ENT.MON.MAG. as a historically relevant periodical in entomology, with a documented role in species identification and academic communication.\",3\n4446,MILTORGAMMA,\"Miltogramma is a genus of flies described by Meigen in 1803, containing species like Miltogramma testaceifrons and Miltogramma asiaticum\",4\n4618,GONIOPHYTO HONSHUENSIS,\"\n\n**GONIOPHYTO HONSHUENSIS** is a species of fly belonging to the *Goniophyto* genus, first described by the entomologist B. Rohdendorf in 1962. The species is primarily associated with the geographical regions of Japan and the former Soviet Union, as noted in its original description. However, a secondary source indicates its presence in China, which may reflect either an expansion of its known range over time, a taxonomic revision, or a potential misattribution in the literature. The discrepancy between the Soviet Union and China as habitats could stem from historical geopolitical changes (e.g., the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991) or differing regional classifications. Despite this, both descriptions concur that *Goniophyto honshuensis* is native to Japan, establishing it as a key component of the local biodiversity in that region. Further research may be required to clarify its distribution in relation to the Soviet Union and China, particularly to determine whether the species persists in parts of the Russian Federation (formerly the Soviet Union) or has been documented in China under a different nomenclatural context. The species remains a subject of interest for entomologists studying dipteran taxonomy and biogeography in East Asia.\",3\n331,ROHDENDORF,\"\n\nROHDENDORF was a prominent Soviet taxonomist and entomologist active in the 1920s–1970s, renowned for his extensive contributions to the classification of flies, particularly within the Sarcophagidae family (flesh flies). His work spanned multiple genera and species, with a focus on morphological and taxonomic studies. Key contributions include the establishment of several genera, such as *Sinonipponia* (1959), *Iranihindia* (1961), *Kramerea*, *Pandelleana*, *Kozlovea*, *Phallosphaera* (1937), *Seniorwhitea* (1937), *Tephromyia*, *Locustaevora* (both in 1928), and *Asiometopia* (1935). He also described numerous species, including *Asiometopia persa* (1935), *Taxigramma heteroneurum* (1935), *Miltogrammoides zimini* (1935), *Miltogramma asiaticum* (1935), *Servaisia jakovlevi* (1937), *Servaisia subamericana* (1932), *Servaisia mixta* (1928), *Parasarcophaga kirgizica* (1969, type locality in Kyrgyzstan, former Soviet Union), *Parasarcophaga emdeni* (1969), *Phylloteles stackelbergi*, *Blaesoxipha arenicola* (1928), *Calliphora tianshanica* (1962), and *Turanogonia smirnovi* (1924). Additionally, he described the subgenus *Eutaxigramma* (1935) and reclassified *teretirostris*.  \n\nRohdendorf’s research extended to defining subgenera and reclassifying genera, such as *Pseudothyrsocnema* (1937), *Phallantha* (1938), and *Bellieriomima* (1937), which he later synonymized or reorganized. He authored significant works on Sarcophaginae and Phyllotelina subfamilies in 1935, 1971, and 1975, and his 1938 study on *Parasarcophaga unguitigris* remains a reference. Among his notable species descriptions are *Boettcherisca septentrionalis* (1937, 1965), *Metopia tshernovae* (1955), *Metopia campestris* (1971), and *Metopia stackelbergi* (1955). He also described *Sarcophaga sera* (1930), *Phallocheira minor* (1937), and *Sarcophaga semenovi* (1925, later reclassified as *Parasarcophaga (Ziminisca) semenovi*).  \n\nRohdendorf’s work included collaborations, such as co-describing *Sarcophila rasnitzyni* (1985) and *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* (1967) and *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) jacobsoni* (1971). He was associated with the genus *Goniophyto*, describing *Goniophyto honshuensis* in 1962 and contributing to its 1965 classification. His 1937 descriptions of *Heteronychia bajkalensis* and the genus *Sarcorohdendorfia* (球麻蝇属) further highlight his focus on regional biodiversity. Notably, he described *Triceratopyga calliphoroides* (叉丽蝇) in 1931 and *Onesiomima pamirica* and *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, with the latter’s type locality in Mongolia (1924).  \n\nRohdendorf’s legacy is marked by meticulous taxonomic work, including the establishment of subgenera like *Phallantha* (1938) and *Pseudothyrsocnema* (1937), and his role in defining the *Harpagophalla* genus (1937). His studies on species such as *KENT’S SARCOPHAGA* and *USURI SARCOPHAGA* (1937) and the 1938 description of the *1354 Tail Pierretia Fly* (Pierretia (s.str.) sororcula) underscore his influence in dipteran taxonomy. Despite some overlapping references to species like *Wohlfahrtia stackelbergi* and *Wohlfahrtia pavlovskyi* (1956), his work remains foundational in entomological literature, particularly for Sarcophagidae systematics.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",94\n3731,CYNOMYIOMIMA STACKELBERGI,\"Cynomyiomima stackelbergi is a species of fly described by Rohdendorf in 1924, found in various regions in China and Mongolia\",23\n5374,CEROMYIA,\"\n\n**CEROMYIA** is a genus of tachinid flies (family Tachinidae) first described by the French entomologist **Robineau-Desvoidy** in 1830. This taxonomic group is distinguished by specific morphological features, including unique patterns of **abdominal setae** (bristles) and characteristic **wing venation**. The abdominal setae, which are small, hair-like structures, are arranged in a manner that aids in differentiating *Ceromyia* from other genera within the Tachinidae family. Similarly, the wing venation—referring to the network of veins in the wings—exhibits a defined structure that is a key diagnostic trait for the genus. These traits collectively contribute to the classification and identification of *Ceromyia* species, which are parasitoid flies known for their ecological role in regulating populations of other insects. The genus is part of the broader Tachinidae family, a group of flies recognized for their diverse life histories and morphological adaptations. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both emphasize the taxonomic placement, morphological characteristics, and historical context of *CEROMYIA*.\",2\n280,SARCOPHAGIDAE,\"\n\n**SARCOPHAGIDAE** (also known as *Sarcophagidae* or 麻蝇科 in Chinese) is a family of flies characterized by distinct morphological and developmental traits. The family includes subfamilies such as **Ameniinae**, **Calliphorinae**, and **Sarcophaginae**, with the latter being particularly notable for its larval features. Members of *Sarcophagidae* are typically identified by their posterior spiracles, which exhibit unique structural adaptations, and specific wing venation patterns that distinguish them from other fly families. Additionally, the anal cerci (posterior appendages) of adult sarcophagids are often described as long and slender, a trait observed in many species within the family.  \n\nThe larvae of *Sarcophagidae* display key characteristics that aid in classification. For instance, larvae in the **Sarcophaginae** subfamily are marked by the presence of 12 or more short projections on the eighth abdominal segment, as noted in one description. Another description highlights that these larvae lack anal tubercles and possess incomplete sternal rings, further refining their morphological profile. These larval traits are critical for differentiating *Sarcophagidae* from related families like *Calliphoridae* (blow flies), which often have distinct developmental features.  \n\nThe family is also referenced in scientific literature, such as the journal *ΦayHa CCCP* (likely a typo or formatting issue, as this appears to be a Cyrillic title), which mentions the species *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) jaroschevskyi*. This example underscores the taxonomic diversity within *Sarcophagidae*, including genera like *Parasarcophaga* and *Liosarcophaga*. While the descriptions provided focus on different aspects—adult morphology, larval anatomy, and specific species—the family is consistently defined by its unique combination of traits, such as the absence of anal tubercles in larvae and the structural peculiarities of posterior spiracles and wing venation.  \n\nIn summary, *Sarcophagidae* is a well-defined family of flies with a complex taxonomy, encompassing subfamilies like **Ameniinae**, **Calliphorinae**, and **Sarcophaginae**. Its members are distinguished by adult features like long anal cerci and specific wing venation, as well as larval traits such as incomplete sternal rings, lack of anal tubercles, and multiple abdominal projections. The family’s inclusion in scientific studies, such as the documentation of *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) jaroschevskyi*, highlights its ecological and taxonomic significance. These characteristics collectively provide a framework for understanding the morphology, life cycle, and classification of sarcophagid flies.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",11\n4764,1279膨端折麻蝇SERVAISIA JAKOVELVI,\"A species of fly described by Rohdendorf in 1937, with a black tail segment and distinct abdominal structures.
