It serves as a type locality in Qinghai for *Phaonia decussatoides*, a species first described from this region. The area is associated with the distribution of multiple genera and species, including *Delia spicularis*, *Chaetogena gynacphorae*, *Helina truncata*, and *Onesiomima pamirica*. Additionally, Yushu is linked to the presence of *Helina brunneipalpis* and *Gonia klapperichi*, further highlighting its biodiversity. The genera *Zaira* and *Meigenia* are also documented as being distributed in Yushu, contributing to its role as a hub for entomological study. While some descriptions refer to Yushu as a \"\"city\"\" and others as a \"\"county,\"\" this reflects its administrative classification as a county-level city within Qinghai Province, a common structure in China where such cities function as both urban centers and county jurisdictions. The repeated emphasis on Qinghai Province underscores the region’s ecological importance, particularly in the context of fly species habitats. Yushu’s association with these taxa suggests it is a key location for research into their taxonomy, behavior, and environmental adaptations. The data collectively position Yushu as a critical reference point for understanding the distribution and diversity of these specific fly species and genera in northwestern China.

Similarly, *Helina xizangensis*, an animal species, is also reported to inhabit ZUOGONG, underscoring its ecological significance as a habitat for both botanical and zoological diversity. The presence of these species highlights the area’s role in supporting unique ecosystems within the Tibetan region. While specific details about the habitat, conservation status, or interactions between these species are not provided in the descriptions, the mention of both in the same location establishes ZUOGONG as a site of scientific interest for biodiversity studies.

These species are part of the subfamily Sarcophaginae, and their classification often references Kangding as the geographic origin of their type specimens. Additionally, Kangding is cited in the taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, a group within the Sarcophagidae family, further underscoring its role in the study and identification of these flies. The city is also noted as a location where certain species are found, contributing to regional biodiversity records. All descriptions consistently identify Kangding as situated in Sichuan Province, China, with no contradictions in its geographic or taxonomic significance. Its repeated mention as a type locality highlights its importance in the scientific documentation of Sarcophagidae species, particularly within the *Phaonia* genus. The city’s ecological and geographic characteristics likely support the presence of these species, making it a focal point for entomological research in the region. In summary, Kangding is a key reference site in Sichuan for the taxonomic classification of multiple Sarcophagidae species, including *Mydaea setifemur kongdinga* and several *Phaonia* species, and is integral to the study of this fly family.\",3\n3679,MAKENG,\"Makeng is a city in Sichuan province, China\",1\n2120,MANGKANG HAITONG,\"\n\nMangkang Haitong is a location in Tibet, China, and is recognized as a site where the species *Musca tibetana* is distributed.
