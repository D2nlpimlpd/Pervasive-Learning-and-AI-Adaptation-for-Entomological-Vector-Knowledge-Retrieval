It is recognized as a significant area for the distribution of certain species, including *Cephalopina titillator* and *Bercaea cruentata*. *Cephalopina titillator*, a species within the Cephalopina genus, is explicitly noted to inhabit this region, with Syria identified as its type locality—the specific location where the species was first described and documented.

The term \"\"foreign region\"\" in one description likely refers to Southwest Asia being referenced in the context of species distribution outside of the speaker’s or writer’s primary area of focus, underscoring its role as a distinct biogeographic zone. Collectively, these descriptions emphasize Southwest Asia as a key area for the presence and study of these two species, with Syria playing a central role in the taxonomic history of *Cephalopina titillator*. The region’s biodiversity and ecological significance are further reinforced by its inclusion in the distribution ranges of both species, though additional research may be needed to clarify the specific habitats or conservation status of *Bercaea cruentata* in the area.
