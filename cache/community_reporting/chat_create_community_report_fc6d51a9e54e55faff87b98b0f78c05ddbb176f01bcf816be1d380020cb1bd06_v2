It is characterized by a body length of 4 mm and exhibits distinct coloration features, including a red-yellow body with yellow tibiae and transparent wings marked by yellow veins. The species is native to Central Asia, with a distribution spanning **Xinjiang** (specifically the **Hamu** region and the **Bugas River** area) and **Mongolia**. The **East Tianshan** region in Xinjiang is noted as the type locality, where the original specimens were collected, underscoring its ecological and taxonomic significance. While the first description emphasizes yellow tibiae and wing veins, the second highlights the red-yellow body coloration, which are complementary traits rather than contradictory. These features collectively define the species’ morphology and geographic range, establishing its identity within the fly fauna of the region. The inclusion of both Xinjiang and Mongolia in its distribution suggests a broader Central Asian presence, though specific habitats or ecological preferences are not detailed in the provided data. The species remains a subject of entomological study due to its unique characteristics and historical documentation.\",8\n2870,ANN. MUS. ZOOL.
