It has a body length of 8 mm and is specifically found in the region of Yunnan, particularly in Liuku and Ruili. This species is a central entity in the community, as it is the subject of the recorded data and is directly linked to the location of its type locality. The description and classification of this species are important for entomological studies and biodiversity documentation [Data: Entities (4340)].\"\n},\n{\n\"summary\": \"Liuku as the type locality for Isomyia spatulicercia\",\n\"explanation\": \"Liuku in Yunnan is identified as the type locality for Isomyia spatulicercia, meaning it is the specific geographic location where the species was first discovered and described. This designation is significant in biological taxonomy, as it provides a reference point for future studies and comparisons.

Further research could be conducted to understand the ecological role of this species, its interactions with other organisms, and its conservation status. The mention of Ruili alongside Liuku also suggests the possibility of a broader distribution or related populations that could be explored.
