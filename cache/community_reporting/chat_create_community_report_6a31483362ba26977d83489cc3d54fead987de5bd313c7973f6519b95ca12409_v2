Their work spanned multiple regions, including Africa, Madagascar, and Asia, with a focus on dipteran biodiversity. EMDEN’s career highlights include a 1940 description of *Atherigona indica infuscata*, as well as early studies on larval ecology, such as documenting larval presence in *Clytochrysus cavifrons* nests in 1954. By 1956, they described *Musca malaisei*, a species later associated with their 1965 publications, suggesting possible revisions or confirmations in subsequent years.  \n\nThe 1965 period marked a prolific phase in EMDEN’s career, during which they described numerous species across diverse genera. These include *Dichaetomyia monticola*, *Dichaetomyia keiseri*, and *Dichaetomyia aureomarginata*, as well as *Musca malaisei* (reiterated in 1965), *Mesembrina aurocaudata*, *Phaonia heteromma*, *Brontaea lasiopa*, *Myospila lasiophthalma*, *Polietes fuscisquamosus*, and *Eudasyphora kempi*. EMDEN also documented *Gymnodia interposita*, a synonym of *Brontaea distincta*, and contributed to the taxonomy of *Neomyia* species, including their distribution patterns. Their work on *Limnophora apiciseta* and *Limnophora glaucescens* further underscores their expertise in morphological classification.  \n\nNotably, EMDEN was the first to name the species *中缅璃蝇* (Sino-Burmese glass fly), highlighting their role in documenting Asian fly fauna. They also described *Helina brunneigena* in 1965, a species later cited as a key example of their taxonomic rigor. EMDEN’s research extended beyond species descriptions to include ecological observations, such as larval behavior in *Clytochrysus cavifrons* nests, and their illustrations and classifications remain foundational in dipteran studies.  \n\nDespite some discrepancies in the data—such as the dual attribution of *Musca malaisei* to 1956 and 1965—the consensus positions EMDEN as a central figure in mid-century entomology, with a particular emphasis on 1965 as a year of significant output. Their legacy is preserved in scientific literature, where their meticulous work on African, Malagasy, and Asian flies continues to inform modern taxonomy and ecological research. EMDEN’s contributions reflect a multidisciplinary approach, combining fieldwork, morphological analysis, and regional distribution studies to advance understanding of fly species diversity.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",30\n3196,ZONGQUAN YANGYING,\"棕颧阳蝇Helina brunneigena Emden, 1965 is a species of fly with brown cheek features, found in Guangdong (Shantou, Zhanjiang) and Malaysia (type locality).
