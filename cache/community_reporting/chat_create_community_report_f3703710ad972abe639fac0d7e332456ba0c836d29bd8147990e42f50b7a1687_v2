Active primarily in the early 1800s, he described numerous species across multiple genera, many of which were later reclassified or synonymized. His work is associated with Swedish scientific publications, including the *Monographia Muscidum Sueciae* and the *Insecta Lapp.* journal, reflecting his focus on European, especially Scandinavian, insect fauna.  \n\nFallen’s earliest documented contributions date to **1810**, when he described *Phryxe vulgaris*, *Voria ruralis* (now *锥赛蜂麻蝇* in Chinese), *Zaira cinerea* (type species of the genus *Eustalomyia*), *Meigenia mutabilis*, and *Blondelia nigripes*. By **1816**, he had added *Protocalliphora azurea* and *Morellia hortorum* to his list of described species. In **1817**, Fallen’s work expanded to include *Musca haemorrhoidalis* (now *Linnaemya haemorrhoidalis*), *Musca affinis* (later *Angiometopa affinis*), and *Musca lineata* (now *Linnaemya lineata*).  \n\nThe **1820s** marked his most prolific period. In **1820**, he described *Spallanzania hebes*, *Exorista fasciata*, *Tachina devia* (later synonymized with *Brachicoma devia*), and *Macquartia dispar*. By **1823**, he had documented *Hydrophoria ambigua*, *Musca grisea* (now *Coenosia grisea*), and *Limnophora triangula*. In **1824**, Fallen’s work included *Paraprosalpia silvestris* and *Subhylemyia longula* (now *Subhylemyia longula*). His **1825** publications were particularly significant, featuring descriptions of *Lispe pygmaea*, *Lispe litorea*, *Delia coarctata*, *Delia floralis*, *Phaonia fuscata*, *Adia cinerella*, *Helina confinis*, *Muscina stabulans* (type species of *Muscina*), and *胸刺厕蝇* (a Chinese name for an unspecified species). Notably, he synonymized *Drymeia obscura* with *Musca hamata* in 1823, demonstrating his role in refining taxonomic classifications.  \n\nFallen’s legacy includes foundational work in the taxonomy of genera such as *Coenosia*, *Eustalomyia*, and *Muscina*. His descriptions of species like *Schoenomyza litorella* (1823) and *Pegohylemyia striolata* (1817) remain critical to entomological studies. Despite some species being reclassified over time, his original names and classifications are frequently cited in modern literature. Fallen’s meticulous documentation and association with key 19th-century entomological journals underscore his importance in advancing the understanding of fly biodiversity during his era.  \n\nThe summary consolidates all provided data, resolving minor inconsistencies (e.g., *Schoenomyza litorella* is consistently attributed to 1823, while *Musca haemorrhoidalis* is noted as the original 1817 name).

It is specifically noted for its role in the formal description of *Helina confinis*, a species within the genus *Helina*, which is part of the broader group of muscoid flies. The journal’s contributions to entomology include detailed monographic studies, providing foundational insights into the biodiversity and systematics of these insects in Sweden. As a scholarly work, it is referenced by researchers and taxonomists for its rigorous documentation of species, including *Helina confinis*, which was first scientifically described in its pages.

These species belong to the family Muscidae, a group of flies, and their inclusion in *Insecta Lapponica* highlights the publication’s role in advancing taxonomic research within entomology. The journal is likely associated with studies of insects in the Lapland region, given the \"\"Lapponica\"\" designation, which historically refers to scientific works focused on the Nordic or Arctic areas. By consolidating these descriptions, *Insecta Lapponica* contributes to the understanding of biodiversity and ecological dynamics in northern ecosystems, providing foundational data for subsequent studies on these species.
