It is characterized by its long antennae, which are noted as black in some sources, and abdominal markings, including yellow abdominal segments. The species has a body length of 4.5–5.5 mm. Its distribution spans multiple regions: it is found in **Xinjiang, China**, as well as **Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan, and other international locations**. The discrepancy in the description year (1902 vs. 1918) may reflect a later revision or clarification of the species by Stein, though the 1902 date is explicitly tied to its initial description. The abdominal features are described as \"\"markings\"\" in one account and \"\"yellow segments\"\" in another, suggesting that the yellow coloration is a key part of the abdominal pattern. Illustrations of the species were provided by Hennig in 1952, aiding in its taxonomic identification. Despite variations in the details across sources, the core attributes of long antennae, yellow abdominal segments, and a geographic range encompassing East and Southeast Asia remain consistent. This species is notable for its morphological traits and ecological presence in both temperate and tropical regions.\",6\n2882,KUERQIN,\"Type locality in Xinjiang, China, for Pygophora longicornis\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5161,PYGOPHORA LONGICORNIS,STEIN,Stein described Pygophora longicornis in 1902,129\n5164,PYGOPHORA LONGICORNIS,KUERQIN,Kuerqin is the type locality for Pygophora longicornis,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
