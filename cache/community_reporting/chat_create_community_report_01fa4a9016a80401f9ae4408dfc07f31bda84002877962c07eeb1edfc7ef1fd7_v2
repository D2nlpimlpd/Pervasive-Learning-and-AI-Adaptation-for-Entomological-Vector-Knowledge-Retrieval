This species is distinguished by its unique morphological features, which align with the broader taxonomic classification of the Lispe genus within the family Syrphidae (hoverflies). As a member of this genus, LISPE TENTACULATA shares characteristics typical of Lispe species, such as a robust body structure and specific wing patterns, while also exhibiting traits that set it apart for identification. The description by DeGeer established its scientific recognition, contributing to the study of dipteran biodiversity. Its name, derived from Latin, may reflect notable physical attributes, though further details on its ecology, behavior, or geographic distribution are not provided in the given data. The species remains a subject of interest in entomological research for its role in understanding evolutionary adaptations within the Syrphidae family.\",12\n2800,LISPE BIVITTATA,\"A species of fly described by Stein in 1909, part of the Lispe genus\",2\n2797,LISPE PYGMAEA,\"A species of fly described by Fallen in 1825, part of the Lispe genus\",2\n2802,LISPE ORIENTALIS,\"A species of fly described by Wiedemann in 1830, part of the Lispe genus\",2\n2771,LISPE HIRSUTIPES,,3\n2759,LISPE CONSANGUINEA,\"\n\n**Lispe consanguinea** is a species of fly belonging to the *Lispe* genus, first described by the entomologist Loew in 1858. This species is distributed across two continents: **China** and **Europe**, indicating a wide geographic range that spans both Eastern Asia and parts of the Old World. As a member of the *Lispe* genus, it is likely a hoverfly (family Syrphidae), a group known for their mimicry of bees and wasps, though specific ecological or behavioral traits of *Lispe consanguinea* are not detailed in the provided data. The species’ binomial name, *Lispe consanguinea*, reflects its taxonomic classification within the genus *Lispe*, which is characterized by small to medium-sized flies often associated with flowering plants. The description by Loew in 1858 establishes its historical recognition in scientific literature, and its presence in both China and Europe highlights its adaptability to diverse habitats. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they align on the taxonomic details and geographic distribution. Further research may be required to elaborate on its life cycle, diet, or role in ecosystems, but the core information confirms its status as a well-documented species within the *Lispe* genus.\",6\n2801,LISPE BIVITTATA SUBBIVITTATA,A subspecies of Lispe bivittata described by Mou,2\n2796,LISPE,\"\n\nLISPE is a genus of flies belonging to the Muscidae family, first described by the entomologist Latrellle. This taxonomic group is characterized by its larvae, which possess distinctive wing-like projections and posterior spiracles that lack long, curved slits—a feature that differentiates them from other related genera. The genus includes several recognized species, such as *Lispe hirsutipes* and *Lispe pygmaea*, among others, which contribute to its taxonomic diversity. As members of the Muscidae family, LISPE species are likely to share general traits with other muscids, such as their role in ecological systems as decomposers or potential interactions with human environments, though specific behavioral or ecological details of LISPE are not provided in the descriptions. The morphological features of the larvae, particularly the absence of curved slits in the posterior spiracles, are critical for distinguishing LISPE from closely related genera within the family. The inclusion of species like *Lispe hirsutipes* and *Lispe pygmaea* highlights the genus’s variability in size and physical adaptations, with \"\"pygmaea\"\" suggesting a diminutive form.
