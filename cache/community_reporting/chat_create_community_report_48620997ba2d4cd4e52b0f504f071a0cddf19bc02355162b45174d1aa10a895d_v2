AURATA,,2\n672,ACKLANDIA SERVADÉII,,1\n744,ANHOMYIA IMBRIDA,,1\n1937,旧北区东部,\"\n\nThe **Eastern Palaearctic Region** (旧北区东部) is a biogeographic subregion of the broader Palaearctic realm, encompassing temperate and subtropical areas of East Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and parts of Russia. It is recognized as a distinct ecological and evolutionary zone due to its unique combination of flora and fauna, shaped by historical climatic and geological factors. This region plays a significant role in the distribution patterns of various species, particularly certain fly genera, which are adapted to its diverse habitats ranging from forests and grasslands to wetlands and agricultural areas.  \n\nSpecifically, the Eastern Palaearctic Region is home to the fly genera **Gymnadichosia**, **Pollenomyia**, and **Melinda**, all of which are documented as part of its entomological biodiversity. These genera, belonging to different fly families, exhibit ecological and taxonomic characteristics that align with the region’s environmental conditions. For instance, *Gymnadichosia* and *Pollenomyia* are often associated with specific plant interactions or microhabitats, while *Melinda* may occupy niches linked to particular climatic or geographic features. Their presence in the Eastern Palaearctic underscores the region’s importance as a center of endemism and speciation for Diptera (true flies).  \n\nThe biogeographic significance of the Eastern Palaearctic Region is further highlighted by its position as a transitional zone between the Palaearctic and the Oriental realms, facilitating the study of species dispersal and adaptation. The distribution of these fly genera within the region contributes to understanding broader ecological dynamics, such as pollination networks, predator-prey relationships, and responses to environmental changes. Researchers often reference this area when analyzing the evolutionary history of insects, as its isolation and climatic stability have fostered distinct faunal assemblages.  \n\nIn summary, the Eastern Palaearctic Region (旧北区东部) is a key biogeographic area in East Asia, characterized by its role in harboring specialized fly genera like *Gymnadichosia*, *Pollenomyia*, and *Melinda*. Its ecological diversity and transitional position make it a critical focus for studies on insect distribution, biodiversity, and biogeographic boundaries. The region’s fauna reflects both its historical continuity and its dynamic interactions with neighboring biomes, offering insights into the complex processes that shape species ranges.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",3\n3953,四川茂平,\"Maoping, Sichuan is a geographical location where P. aurata was first described\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5475,FAUNE DE FRANCE,FRANCE,Faune de France is a French scientific publication associated with the country France,21\n6856,粉腹丽蝇属,SEGUY,Seguy described the genus Pollenomyia in 1935,20\n7449,SEGUY,P.
