The genus is characterized by distinct morphological features, including a black body covered in a grayish-white powder, as noted in one description. Taxonomically, it is identified by specific bristle arrangements on the mesotibia (three anterior dorsal bristles) and a single scutellar bristle, as well as unique wing venation ratios. These traits align with the broader classification of tachinid flies, which are known for their parasitic lifestyle, often targeting other insects. The species *Pseudoperichaeta nigrolineata* is explicitly mentioned as a member of this genus. The Chinese name for the genus, \"\"赛寄蝇属,\"\" is also provided, reflecting its recognition in non-English entomological literature. While the descriptions agree on the genus's tachinid classification and key morphological markers, they do not present contradictory information about its biology or taxonomy. The reproductive strategy of ovoviviparity—where eggs develop internally until hatching—is highlighted as a defining trait, underscoring its adaptation to parasitism. Overall, *Pseudoperichaeta* is a well-defined genus within the Tachinidae family, distinguished by its coloration, bristle patterns, and reproductive method.

In 1858, Brauer described two species, *Rhinoestrus purpureus* and *Crivellia silenus*, the latter of which is referenced in publications about domestic animal larvae in the USSR. \n\nThroughout the 1880s and 1890s, Brauer collaborated with other scientists to co-describe several genera. In 1889, he co-described *Discochaeta*, *Dexodes machairopsis*, *Pseudogonia*, and *Lophyromyia clausa*. He also co-established the genus *Wohlfahrtia* in the same year. In 1891, Brauer described *Strobiloestrus* and *Xylotachina*, while also co-describing *Pseudoperichaeta* and *Xylotachina* (the latter with another collaborator). In 1893, he co-described the genus *Eutachina* with Bergenstamm, *Synthesiomyia*, and *Cryptolucilia* (again with Bergenstamm). Additionally, he is credited with describing the genus *Perichaeta* in 1893, as noted in a Chinese-language source. \n\nBrauer’s work extended to other genera, including *Metoposisyrops* in 1916, which he co-described. He also described *Gasterophilus inermis*, a species associated with the Ewenki Banner, though the exact nature of this connection remains unspecified. His taxonomic efforts spanned a wide range of flies, particularly within the Tachinidae family, and his descriptions were foundational for later studies in entomology. \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in identifying Brauer as a key figure in the field, with no direct contradictions in the data.

The genus is taxonomically distinguished by several key anatomical traits, including a nearly bare arista (a bristle-like structure on the head), short bristles located at the base of the arista, and other morphological characteristics specific to its classification. These features help differentiate *Synthesiomyia* from closely related genera within the subfamily. The genus was first formally described in 1893 by the entomologists Brauer and Bergenstamm, who established its taxonomic framework based on observed morphological attributes.  \n\n*Synthesiomyia* is notable for including the species *Synthesiomyia nudiseta*, which is a well-documented member of the genus. This species, like others in the genus, exhibits the defining traits of *Synthesiomyia*, such as the nearly bare arista and short bristles at its base. The genus is part of the broader ecological and taxonomic study of flies, particularly those with specialized adaptations in their anatomy. While the descriptions provided focus on morphological classification, further research into the genus may explore its ecological roles, geographic distribution, or interactions with other organisms.  \n\nThe information presented is consistent across the descriptions, with no contradictions to resolve. Together, they establish *Synthesiomyia* as a distinct taxonomic group characterized by unique anatomical features and its inclusion of the species *S. nudiseta*.

The genus is distinguished by a combination of morphological traits, including specific wing venation patterns and bristle arrangements. Notably, Xylotachina species exhibit **two frontal bristles** on the head, a feature critical for taxonomic identification within the group. Additionally, a defining characteristic is the presence of a **row of black bristles behind the postocular bristles on the occiput**, which further aids in differentiating this genus from related taxa. The tibiae of these flies are also marked by **spines**, contributing to their unique physical profile. Wing vein patterns, a key diagnostic feature in tachinid flies, are particularly notable in Xylotachina, though specific details of these patterns are not elaborated in the provided descriptions. The genus is part of the broader Tachinidae family, known for its parasitoid lifestyle, though the ecological habits of Xylotachina are not explicitly detailed here. All three descriptions concur on the taxonomic authority (Brauer and Bergenstamm) and the year of description (1891), while emphasizing distinct morphological markers such as bristle configurations and tibial spines. No contradictions exist in the core taxonomic or physical attributes, allowing for a unified summary.

The same year also saw the description of *Lophyromyia clausa*, though the specific role of Bergenstamm in this work is not detailed. By 1891, Bergenstamm contributed to the taxonomy of *Xylotachina* and *Leucomyia*, with the latter being described alongside other authors. In 1893, Bergenstamm co-authored the description of the genus *Eutachina* with Brauer, as well as *Synthesiomyia* and *Cryptolucilia* (also with Brauer). Additionally, Bergenstamm is associated with the genus *Pseudoperichaeta*, though the exact year for this contribution is unspecified. The entity *Metoposisyrops* was co-described in 1916, marking a later collaboration. Bergenstamm’s work primarily focused on dipteran taxonomy, with notable partnerships in describing genera such as *Xylotachina* (1891) and *Eutachina* (1893). While some descriptions are attributed to co-authorship with Brauer, others are listed without specific collaborators. The species *Dexodes machairopsis* and *Lophyromyia clausa* are explicitly tied to Bergenstamm’s 1889 efforts, alongside the genera *Discochaeta*, *Pseudogonia*, and *Pseudoperichaeta*. The 1893 contributions include *Eutachina*, *Synthesiomyia*, and *Cryptolucilia*, further solidifying Bergenstamm’s role in classifying diverse fly taxa. Despite variations in the years and collaborators mentioned, the descriptions consistently highlight Bergenstamm’s expertise in entomology and taxonomy, particularly in the 1880s and 1890s.
