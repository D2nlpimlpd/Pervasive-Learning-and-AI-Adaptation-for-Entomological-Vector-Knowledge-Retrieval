The province’s cities and regions, such as Lanzhou, Qingyang, Tianshui, Qingshui, and the Qilian Mountains, are highlighted as key locations for specific distributions. For instance, *Helina qilianshanensis* is found in the Qilian Mountains, while *Bellardia menechmoides* is recorded in Tianshui. Additionally, Gansu supports species like *Drymeia vicana*, *Paregle audacula*, *Cuphocera varia*, and *Pegomya crinilamella*, alongside domestic records for *Delia coarctata* in Qingyang, Tianshui, and Qingshui. \n\nThe province is a critical habitat for multiple *Helina* species, including *Helina confinis*, and for *Phaonia* species such as *Phaonia aureolimaculata*, *Ph. guangdongensis*, *Ph. cothurnoloba*, *Ph. jinbeiensis*, and *Ph. tenuirostris*. Notable localities like Sanchan Tan and Diebu (type locality for *Lasiomma graciliapicum*) further underscore Gansu’s ecological importance. Chinese-named species, including 紫翠蝇 (*likely *Phaonia* or *Chrysomya* spp.*), 孟氏翠蝇 (*possibly *Chrysomya mengi* or similar*), 棕尾别麻蝇 (*likely *Lasiomma* spp.*), and 秉氏亚麻蝇 (*possibly *Pegomya* or *Delia* spp.*), are also documented here, alongside the *1338舟曲细麻蝇* and *1352 Lingulate Pierretia Fly*. \n\nGansu’s pastoral areas are linked to the distribution of *Haematobia*, and the province is home to *Phormia regina* (Sunan, Lanzhou) and *Cynomya mortuorum*.

As a major urban center in the region, Lanzhou is situated along the Yellow River and is known for its historical, cultural, and economic importance in northwestern China. The city’s association with these species highlights its ecological relevance in entomological studies. *Parasarcophaga aegyptica*, a parasitoid fly, is documented to inhabit areas within Lanzhou, contributing to local biodiversity and potentially playing a role in pest control or ecosystem dynamics. Similarly, *Lasiomma curtigena*, a species of cicada, is also reported to be distributed in the city, indicating the presence of suitable habitats for its life cycle, such as forests or shrublands. The repeated mention of Lanzhou’s connection to these species across the descriptions underscores its status as a key location for their study and conservation. While the descriptions do not provide specific details about the ecological interactions or population trends of these species, they collectively affirm Lanzhou’s role in their geographic range. The city’s climate, characterized by cold winters and hot summers, and its semi-arid environment may influence the distribution patterns of both organisms. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions consistently identify Lanzhou as a city in Gansu Province, China, and link it to the presence of these species.
