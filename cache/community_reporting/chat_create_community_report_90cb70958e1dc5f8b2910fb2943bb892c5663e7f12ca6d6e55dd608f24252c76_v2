Its larvae breed in human and animal feces, and adults are collected in specific morphological traits.\",8\n380,KYRGYZSTAN,\"\n\nKyrgyzstan, a landlocked country in Central Asia, is recognized as a significant region for the distribution of diverse fly species. Historically part of the Soviet Union, it is now an independent nation and remains a key area for entomological studies. The country is documented as a habitat for several notable species, including **Sarcophaga variegata**, a blow fly, and **Scathophaga** species, which are typically associated with wetland environments. Additionally, the genus **Miltogrammoides** is reported to be distributed in Kyrgyzstan, reflecting its ecological role in the region.  \n\nKyrgyzstan is also linked to the presence of **Parasarcophaga pleskei**, a species within the Sarcophagidae family, and serves as a location for **Dasyphora apicotaeniata** and **Dasyphora asiatica**, both belonging to the Dasyphoridae family. The species **1279膨端折麻蝇** (a Chinese name for a fly species, likely *Sarcophaga* sp.) is noted as distributed in the country, further emphasizing its biodiversity. Other documented species include **Pegohylemyia alatavensis** and **Pegohylemyia silva**, which are part of the Hylemyiidae family, and **Phaonia mimobasiseta** and **Phaonia hybrida**, both within the Muscidae family.  \n\nThe country supports the distribution of **Helina parcepilosa** (Helinidae family) and **Calythea nigra** (likely a member of the Muscidae or related family), as well as **Helicophagella rohdendorfi**, a species from the Helicophagidae family. These findings highlight Kyrgyzstan’s ecological importance as a region where multiple fly genera, including Sarcophaga, Phaonia, and Pegohylemyia, coexist. The presence of such species may be influenced by the country’s varied landscapes, which include mountainous terrain, alpine meadows, and arid zones, providing diverse microhabitats for these insects.  \n\nWhile some descriptions reference Kyrgyzstan as part of the Soviet Union, this reflects historical taxonomic records rather than its current status as an independent nation. The cumulative data underscores Kyrgyzstan’s role in the biogeography of flies, particularly in Central Asia, and suggests it is a critical area for further entomological research to understand species interactions and environmental adaptations. The country’s inclusion in the distribution of these species, spanning both documented and cataloged entries, illustrates its contribution to the broader ecological and scientific understanding of dipteran fauna in the region.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",10\n4879,GELING,\"City in Tibet, China, where Helicophagella rohdendorfi is distributed.\",1\n3805,MILIN,\"\n\nMILIN is a district in Tibet, China, recognized as a significant geographical and administrative location within the region. It serves as the type locality for the plant species *Bellardia oligochaeta*, meaning this area is where the species was first identified and described scientifically. Additionally, MILIN is noted as the city in Tibet, China, where the species *Helicophagella rohdendorfi* is distributed, indicating its role as a habitat or point of origin for this organism. The district is also associated with the mode locality (a term often used to denote the primary or representative location for a species) of *Polleniopsis milina*, a species whose name directly references MILIN, likely due to its discovery or prominence in the area. \n\nWhile the descriptions present MILIN as both a district and a city, this is not contradictory in the context of Chinese administrative divisions, where a city may function as the administrative center of a district. The entity is thus best understood as a district with a central urban area (the city) that serves as the focal point for its ecological and taxonomic significance. The presence of these three species—*Bellardia oligochaeta*, *Helicophagella rohdendorfi*, and *Polleniopsis milina*—highlights MILIN’s importance in biodiversity studies, particularly for botany and entomology. The naming of *Polleniopsis milina* after the location underscores the area’s role in scientific nomenclature, linking the species to its place of origin. \n\nMILIN’s designation as a type or mode locality for these species emphasizes its value as a reference site for taxonomic research. The district’s unique ecological characteristics, likely shaped by its high-altitude Tibetan environment, contribute to the presence and study of such specialized organisms. Despite the varying terminology (district, city, mode locality), the descriptions collectively establish MILIN as a key location in Tibet for understanding the distribution and classification of these species. The summary integrates all provided data, resolving any ambiguity by framing MILIN as a district with a central city, while emphasizing its scientific relevance through the associated species. \n\n(Word count: 199)\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9183,HELICOPHAGELLA ROTHENDORFI,TIBET,\"The fly species is found in Tibet, China\",142\n860,KYRGYZSTAN,ECONOMIC INSECTS OF CHINA,The Economic Insects of China publication documents fly species found in Kyrgyzstan,51\n9185,HELICOPHAGELLA ROTHENDORFI,GELING,\"The fly species is distributed in Geling, Tibet\",9\n7067,BELLARDIA OLIGOCHAETA,MILIN,\"Bellardia oligochaeta originates from Milin, Tibet\",7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
