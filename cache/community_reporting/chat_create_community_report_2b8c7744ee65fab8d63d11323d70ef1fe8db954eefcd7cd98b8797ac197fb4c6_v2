He is cited as one of the individuals involved in formally defining and naming this taxonomic group, which falls under the broader field of entomology or biological classification. The genus *Parasarcophaga* is part of the Diptera order, specifically within the family Sarcophagidae, though the provided data does not specify further details about the genus itself. All three descriptions consistently attribute Johnston’s role to the 1921 taxonomic work, emphasizing his collaboration with other researchers in this endeavor. There are no contradictions in the information, as each source aligns on the key facts: his authorship, the genus in question, and the year of its description. The summary highlights his scientific contribution to the classification of *Parasarcophaga*, underscoring his role as a co-author or co-scientist in this historical taxonomic effort. No additional biographical or contextual details about Johnston are included in the provided data, so the focus remains solely on his association with the 1921 description of the genus. This information is presented in third person, as requested, and integrates all entity-related descriptions into a unified narrative.\",2\n4800,PARASARCOHPAGA,A genus of flies with a broad sixth tergite and a dense tuft of short setae on the fourth abdominal plate,2\n4797,TIEGS,\"\n\n**TIEGS** is a scientific entity associated with the description of the genus *Parasarcophaga*, which was formally introduced in 1921. The entity is recognized as one of the authors or scientists who contributed to the taxonomic classification of this genus, as noted in multiple descriptions. While the specific role or collaboration of TIEGS within the broader scientific team remains unspecified in the provided data, all accounts consistently attribute the 1921 description of *Parasarcophaga* to their involvement. The genus *Parasarcophaga* belongs to the family Sarcophagidae, a group of flies commonly known as flesh flies, and its establishment in 1921 marks a significant contribution to entomological taxonomy. The descriptions emphasize TIEGS’s role as a co-author or co-scientist, suggesting collaborative work in defining the genus. No contradictions exist among the provided statements, as they all align on the key facts of TIEGS’s contribution to *Parasarcophaga* in 1921.
