It is specifically noted as a habitat for the Caesar Greenbottle Fly (*Lucilia caesar*), a blowfly species commonly found in temperate regions. Additionally, Gaolingzi is linked to *Heteronychia bajkalensis*, a species of hoverfly, and *Calliphora axata*, a blowfly known for its role in forensic entomology. The area is also reported to host *Musca bezzii*, a species of housefly, and *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) chini*, another blowfly species. While some descriptions refer to \"\"the species\"\" in a general sense, the specific taxa mentioned collectively highlight Gaolingzi as a biodiversity hotspot within Heilongjiang, contributing to regional faunal records. The repeated emphasis on its connection to these species underscores its importance in entomological studies, particularly for understanding the distribution and ecological roles of flies and hoverflies in the region. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all references consistently identify Gaolingzi as part of Heilongjiang, China, with varying species associations.

These species, which include both blowflies and houseflies, are integral to the biodiversity of the region and are often studied in entomological research. Changchun's geographical and climatic conditions in Jilin Province provide a suitable habitat for these insects, contributing to their presence and ecological roles. The city's association with these species highlights its importance in understanding their life cycles, behaviors, and interactions within the broader ecosystem of northeastern China. While the descriptions emphasize different species, they collectively underscore Changchun's role as a hub for diverse insect populations, offering valuable insights for scientific and environmental studies. The mention of \"\"the species\"\" in one description likely refers to the Caesar Greenbottle Fly, aligning with the other specific entries.
