The province is also associated with the presence of other species in specific locations, including Jianyang, Huangkeng, Guangze, and Chao’an. However, a potential contradiction arises in the data: while Jianyang, Huangkeng, and Guangze are confirmed to be within Fujian, Chao’an is actually a county in the neighboring Guangdong Province, not Fujian. This discrepancy may stem from an error in the original data or a misattribution of species distribution. Resolving this, the comprehensive summary clarifies that *Atherigona triglomerata* is documented in Fujian, with its distribution extending to the cities and regions of Jianyang, Huangkeng, and Guangze within the province. The mention of Chao’an likely reflects an inaccuracy, as it lies outside Fujian’s administrative boundaries. Fujian, located in southeastern China along the Taiwan Strait, is a coastal province known for its diverse ecosystems, which support a range of species. The inclusion of multiple locations within Fujian underscores the province’s ecological significance as a habitat for *Atherigona triglomerata* and potentially other species. This synthesis integrates all provided information while addressing the inconsistency regarding Chao’an’s provincial affiliation.
