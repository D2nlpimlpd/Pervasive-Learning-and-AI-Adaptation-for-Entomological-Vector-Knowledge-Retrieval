It is characterized by distinct morphological features that distinguish it within the fly family. The genus is notable for its males possessing a **hooked lateral tail lobe**, a key diagnostic trait. Additionally, Heterostylodes species exhibit a **long third antennal segment**, which contributes to their identification. Morphologically, they also have a **single pair of premedian bristles**, a feature consistent across the genus. The male reproductive anatomy includes a **sickle-shaped aedeagus**, further defining their taxonomic classification. In terms of size, the reference body length for Heterostylodes ranges between **3.0 and 6.0 millimeters**, placing them in the category of small to medium-sized flies. These combined traits—long third antennal segment, hooked tail lobe in males, premedian bristle configuration, and sickle-shaped aedeagus—form the basis for distinguishing Heterostylodes from other genera within its taxonomic group. The genus remains a subject of entomological study due to its unique anatomical adaptations and ecological roles.\",2\n474,HETEROSTYLODES HENNIG,Heterostylodes Hennig is a person who described the genus Heterostylodes in 1967,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n399,HETEROSTYLODES,HENNIG,Hennig is the taxonomist who described the genus Heterostylodes,67\n389,HETEROSTYLODES HENNIG,HETEROSTYLODES,Heterostylodes Hennig described the genus Heterostylodes in 1967,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
