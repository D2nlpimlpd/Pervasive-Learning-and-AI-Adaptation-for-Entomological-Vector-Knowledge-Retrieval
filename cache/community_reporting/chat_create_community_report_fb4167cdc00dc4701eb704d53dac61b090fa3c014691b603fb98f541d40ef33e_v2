Distributed in Guizhou (Jianhe), Tibet (Motuo), Japan (Honshu, Ishikawa Prefecture, Hokkaido, Kyushu), and Europe (Sweden, the type locality).\",4\n484,SUWA,\"\n\nSUWA is a Japanese entomologist and taxonomist renowned for their extensive contributions to the study and classification of Diptera (flies), particularly within the families Anthomyiidae and Hylemyidae. Active primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, SUWA described numerous species and genera, including the genus *Meliniella* in 1974, with its type species *Meliniella sikisima*, and the genus *Shakshainia*, introducing the species *Shakshainia rametoka*. Their work on *Pegohylemyia* is notable, as they documented multiple species such as *Pegohylemyia tridentifera* (1986), *Pegohylemyia spinisternata* (1974), *Pegohylemyia nigrigenis*, *Pegohylemyia pseudomaculipes*, and *Pegohylemyia maculipedella* in publications like the *Insect Research Journal* and *Chinese Economic Insect Monograph*. SUWA also described *Pegomya japonica* (1974), *Pegomya nigra* (1974), and its subspecies *Pegomya japonica mokanensis*, alongside *Hydrophoria montana* (1970) and *Phorbia pilostyla* (1977). \n\nIn addition to species descriptions, SUWA contributed to understanding host plant associations and geographic distributions of flies, including *Pegomya* species, and was cited in works related to *Phorbia fascicularis* in Japan. They also documented *Delia karasawana* (1974) and *Delia takizawai* (1974), as well as *Hylemya nigrimana* and *Hylemya femoralis*. SUWA’s research extended to *Chionomyia vetula* (1974) and *Paraprosalpia silvatica* (1974), with the latter being described twice in the data. Their work often appeared in Japanese entomological literature, reflecting a focus on regional biodiversity. \n\nThe entity’s name is associated with both scientific and Chinese vernacular species names, such as 黄跗粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya melatrochanter*), 喜马拉雅粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya criniventris*), 东方粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya nigra*), and 长板粪泉蝇 (*Pegomya japonica mokanensis*), as well as 亚山花蝇 (*Hyporites shakshain*). SUWA’s legacy includes foundational taxonomic studies that remain referenced in subsequent research on fly distributions and ecology. Their work in 1974 was particularly prolific, establishing multiple genera and species, while their 1970 and 1977 studies expanded on host plant interactions and regional faunal records. Despite some repetition in the data, all contributions consistently attribute to SUWA, underscoring their role as a key figure in Japanese entomology.\",35\n1347,PARAPROSALPIA SILVATICA,\"A species of fly described by Suwa in 1974, with specific abdominal and wing features.

MATSUM.,\"\n\n**INS. MATSUM.** is a publication associated with the description of the species *Pegomya japonica*, commonly known as the Japanese Pegomya fly. The entity is specifically referenced in the context of entomological research, where it served as a source for documenting the taxonomic details of this fly species. One of the key pieces of information provided is that *Pegomya japonica* was described in 1974 within the pages of **Ins. Matsum.**, which likely refers to a journal or scientific work published by or under the auspices of the Matsumoto Institute, a research entity historically linked to studies in insect taxonomy. The Chinese name for the species, 亚山花蝇 (*Yàshān huāyíng*), is also cited in the same publication, confirming its role in bridging scientific and regional nomenclature. While the descriptions do not explicitly detail the content or scope of **Ins. Matsum.** beyond its connection to *Pegomya japonica*, the publication is recognized as a scholarly reference for this species, contributing to its formal classification in 1974. The entity’s significance lies in its contribution to the entomological record, particularly in documenting the Japanese Pegomya fly, which is part of the broader *Pegomya* genus within the family *Syrphidae* (hoverflies). The lack of additional details about the publication’s other works or authors suggests that its primary relevance here is its role in the 1974 taxonomic description of *Pegomya japonica*. The use of both the scientific and Chinese names in the descriptions highlights the publication’s utility in cross-referencing international and local taxonomic literature. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they both align on the publication’s role in describing the species and the year of publication. **Ins. Matsum.** remains a notable source for this specific taxonomic entry, underscoring its importance in the field of dipteran entomology.\",2\n797,YICHUN WUYANG,\"\n\nYICHUN WUYANG is a location in Heilongjiang Province, China, recognized for its ecological significance as a habitat for several notable species. It is the site where the fly species *Phaonia subommatina* was first discovered, marking its importance in entomological research. Additionally, Yichun Wuyang serves as a sublocation within Heilongjiang where the beetle *Heteronychia abramovi* is found, further highlighting its role in supporting diverse insect populations. The area is also associated with *Hydrophoria montana*, another species documented in the region, though the exact nature of this association (e.g., habitat, discovery, or ecological interaction) is not explicitly detailed in the provided descriptions. Collectively, these references underscore Yichun Wuyang’s value as a biodiversity hotspot in Heilongjiang, contributing to the study of both dipteran and coleopteran fauna. The descriptions are consistent in identifying the entity as a geographical location within the same province, with no direct contradictions to resolve. Its mention in relation to three distinct species suggests it is a focal point for scientific observations and ecological surveys in the region.\",1\n1012,KONGZHAO MOUNTAIN,A location in Japan serving as the type locality for Delia longitheca,1\n1104,HOKKAIDŌ,\"Region in Japan, the type locality for Hyporites shakshain\",1\n1455,NAGANO,\"Prefecture in Japan, type locality for *Pegomya nigra*\",1\n1459,ZEITSCHRIFT FÜR MORPHOLOGIE UND ÖKOLOGIE DER TIERE,Journal (*Zeitschr.

It is associated with the species *Achoetandrus rufifacies*, which was documented in a 1958 study by Gan, highlighting its ecological or taxonomic relevance to the region. Additionally, Tokyo is part of the distribution range for *Musca conducens*, a species of fly, further underscoring its role in biodiversity research. The city also serves as the type locality for *黄跗粪泉蝇* (likely *Musca rufifacies* or a related species, based on the Chinese name), indicating that the species was first formally described using specimens collected there.  \n\nOne description erroneously states that Tokyo is a city in Vietnam; this is incorrect, as Tokyo is unequivocally located in Japan. Another entry references the \"\"Ryukyu Islands\"\" (琉球群岛), a region in southern Japan that includes Okinawa and surrounding islands. While the Ryukyu Islands are a distinct geographical area within Japan, they are not directly part of Tokyo. However, the inclusion of this phrase in the data may imply broader regional connections or studies involving Japanese locations, including Tokyo.  \n\nIn summary, Tokyo, Japan, is a key urban center with documented ties to multiple entomological species and historical research. Its association with *Achoetandrus rufifacies* (1958 study), *Musca conducens*, and the type locality for *黄跗粪泉蝇* reflects its importance in scientific observations of insect populations. The contradictory mention of Vietnam is resolved by confirming Tokyo’s correct national affiliation, while the reference to the Ryukyu Islands is contextualized as a separate Japanese region. These details collectively position Tokyo as a focal point for understanding species dynamics in Japan.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n472,CHIROSIA FRONTATA,TIBET,Chirosia frontata is distributed in Tibet (Motuo),138\n607,SUWA,ANIMAL TAXONOMY JOURNAL,Suwa's work on Shakshainia rametoka is published in the Animal Taxonomy Journal,54\n2010,PARAPROSALPIA SILVATICA,SUWA,Suwa described the species Paraprosalpia silvatica in 1974,44\n2435,长板粪泉蝇,SUWA,Suwa described 长板粪泉蝇,42\n1264,DELIA LONGITHECA,SUWA,Suwa described Delia longitheca in 1974,40\n1495,亚山花蝇,SUWA,Suwa described the species Hyporites shakshain in 1974,40\n2353,PEGOMYA JAPONICA,SUWA,Suwa described Pegomya japonica in 1974,40\n2246,PEGOMYA NIGRA,SUWA,Suwa described *Pegomya nigra* in 1974,39\n2408,喜马拉雅粪泉蝇,SUWA,Suwa described 喜马拉雅粪泉蝇 in 1977,39\n1105,PHORBIA PILOSTYLA,SUWA,Suwa described Phorbia pilostyla in 1977,38\n1236,短棘地种蝇DELIA TAKIZAWAI,SUWA,Suwa described Delia takizawai in 1974,38\n1344,DELIA KARASAWANA,SUWA,Suwa described Delia karasawana in 1974,38\n1782,棘腹泉种蝇,SUWA,Suwa is the author of the species Pegohylemyia spinisternata,38\n2402,黄跗粪泉蝇,SUWA,Suwa described 黄跗粪泉蝇 in 1974,38\n1021,SUWA,HYLEMIA FEMORALIS,Suwa contributed to the description of Hylemya femoralis in 1915,36\n1694,SUWA,PEGOHYLEMIA SPINISTERNATA,Suwa described Pegohylemyia spinisternata in 1974,36\n2233,SUWA,INS.MATS.,Suwa published Pegomya criniventris in Ins.Mats.,36\n2362,SUWA,EMMESOMYIA FLAVITARSIS,Suwa described this species,36\n2462,SUWA,EMMESOMYIA HASEGAWAI,Suwa is an author who described the species Emmesomyia hasegawai,36\n2463,SUWA,EMMESOMYIA ORIENS,Suwa is an author who described the species Emmesomyia oriens,36\n1706,PEGOHYLEMIA SILVA,KYRGYZSTAN,Species found in Kyrgyzstan,13\n2025,PARAPROSALPIA SILVATICA,INSECTA MATS.,The species is documented in the Insecta Mats. publication,10\n934,HYDROPHORIA MONTANA,ANDUO,Anduo is a location in Tibet where Hydrophoria montana is distributed,9\n1492,INS.
