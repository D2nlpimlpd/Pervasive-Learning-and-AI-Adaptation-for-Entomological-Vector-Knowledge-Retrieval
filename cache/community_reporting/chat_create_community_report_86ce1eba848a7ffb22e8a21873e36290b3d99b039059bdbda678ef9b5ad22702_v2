As part of the Ryukyu Islands, it lies in the East China Sea, approximately 150 kilometers south of Kyushu. The island is notable for being a habitat for several species, including *Musca sorbens*, a fly species associated with human and animal habitats, and *Pollenomyia okazakii*, a type of midge. Both species are documented as being distributed on Amami-Oshima, with the latter specifically linked to the Ryukyu chain’s ecological context. The descriptions collectively emphasize the island’s role as a geographical and biological site where these species thrive, underscoring its importance in regional entomological studies. While the fourth description (\"\"Island in the Ryukyu chain, Japan, where the species is found\"\") is vague in naming the species, it aligns with the more specific references to *Pollenomyia okazakii* and *Musca sorbens*. No contradictions exist in the data, as all descriptions converge on Amami-Oshima’s identity as a Ryukyu island in Japan and its association with these two species. The summary integrates all provided details to present a cohesive overview of the island’s ecological relevance.\",5\n3938,POLLONOMYIA OKAZAKII,,10\n1976,PRIMORSKY KRAI,,5\n1151,RYUKYU,\"\n\n**RYUKYU** is an island chain and region located in Japan, specifically within the Okinawa Prefecture and its surrounding islands. It serves as a geographical and ecological hub for several species, including the **1340杯细麻蝇** (a type of fly) and **Fucellia boninensis**, both of which are documented to be distributed in this area. The Ryukyu region is characterized by its subtropical climate and diverse ecosystems, which support unique biodiversity. While the descriptions emphasize the presence of these two species, they collectively highlight the Ryukyu's role as a significant location for entomological studies, given its status as a shared habitat for multiple insect species. The entity \"\"RYUKYU\"\" is consistently referenced across the descriptions as a Japanese region, with no contradictions in its identification or the species associated with it.\",3\n3892,OITA,\"\n\n**OITA** is a prefecture located in the Kyushu region of Japan, which also includes a city of the same name, Oita City, serving as the capital of the prefecture. The prefecture of Oita is recognized as the **type locality** for the species *Pollenomyia okazakii*, a fly species first described in this region. Additionally, Oita Prefecture is designated as the **mode locality** for the species *Paradichosia scutellata*, another fly species associated with the area. While the city of Oita is explicitly noted as the type locality for *Pollenomyia okazakii*, the prefecture as a whole is linked to both species, with *Paradichosia scutellata* being tied to the broader administrative region. This distinction clarifies that the city and prefecture, though sharing the same name, are separate but related entities within Japan’s administrative hierarchy. The data collectively highlight Oita’s significance in entomological taxonomy, particularly for these two fly species, with the prefecture encompassing the geographic scope for *Paradichosia scutellata* and the city specifically for *Pollenomyia okazakii*. No direct contradictions exist in the descriptions when considering the hierarchical relationship between the city and prefecture; the variations in terminology (city vs. prefecture) reflect the specific localities tied to each species’ classification. Oita’s role as both a city and prefecture underscores its importance in scientific studies related to these species, serving as a key reference point for their geographic origins. The prefecture’s location in Kyushu, a major island in southern Japan, further contextualizes its ecological and taxonomic relevance. In summary, Oita Prefecture and its capital city are central to the taxonomic records of *Pollenomyia okazakii* and *Paradichosia scutellata*, with the city providing the precise type locality for the former and the prefecture acting as the mode locality for the latter. This dual designation emphasizes the region’s contribution to the documentation and study of biodiversity in Japan.
