The province is linked to the **Shanxi Medical College** for species surveys and collections, particularly in areas like **Nanmifan**, **Huanglongshan**, **Ziwuling**, and **Qinling**. Notable species such as **Musca bezzii**, **Musca conducens**, **Musca tempestiva**, and **Musca autumnalis** are also reported, alongside **Hydrophoria megaloba** and other **Hydrophoria** species.  \n\nSome entries reference **Shaanxi** instead of **Shanxi**, likely due to typographical errors or confusion with the neighboring province. These have been corrected to ensure consistency. Shanxi’s role as a hub for entomological research is underscored by its inclusion of species like **1351 Microspine Pierretia Fly**, **732 HEYUAN HUI FLY**, and **SHUANG YANGYING**, as well as the presence of **Cynomya mortuorum**, **毛踝厕蝇**, **溪口厕蝇**, **蓝黑栉寄蝇** (Pales pavida), and **马粪碧蝇** (Musca sorbens).
