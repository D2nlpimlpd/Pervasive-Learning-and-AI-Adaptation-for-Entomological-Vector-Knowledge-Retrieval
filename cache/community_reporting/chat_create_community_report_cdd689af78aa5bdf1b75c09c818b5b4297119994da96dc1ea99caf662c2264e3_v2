He established several genera, including *Scathophaga* (1803), *Anthomyia* (1803), *Gonia* (1803), and *Exorista* (1803), and described numerous species across his career. His work in 1803 also included the species *Exorista larvarum* (1800) and *Sarcophaga erythrura* (1806), the latter of which later became part of the *Sarcophaga* genus he formally described in 1826. In 1824, Meigen documented multiple fly species, such as *Platymyia hortulana*, *Platymyia mitis*, *Frontina laeta*, *Bactromyia aurulenta*, *Bothria frontosa*, *Zenillia dolosa*, *Pterella grisea*, and *Compsilura concinnata*. He also established the genus *Mesembrina* in 1826, contributing to the classification of species like *Phrosinella nasuta* (1824) and *Phylloteles pictipennis* (1844).  \n\nMeigen’s 1826 work was particularly prolific, with descriptions of over 60 species. These included *Nupedia aestiva*, *Nupedia infirma*, *Pegohylemyia fugax*, *Hydrophoria divisa*, *Hydrotaea bimaculata*, *Leucophora sociata*, *Phormia regina*, *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Lispe caesia*, *Lispe longicollis*, *Delia platura*, *Delia antiqua*, *Musca chrysorrhoea* (type species for *Orneocalliphora*), *Musca agilis* (type species for *Dasyphora*), *Heterostylodes pratensis*, *Phaonia errans*, *Helina obscurata*, *Helina reversio* (1836), *Hylemya partita*, and *Hyleorus elatus* (1838). Notably, he described *Calliphora vicina* (originally *Calliphora erythrocephala* in 1826) and *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum*, both significant in blowfly taxonomy. His 1826 publications also introduced the genus *Bercaea* and *Onesia*, as well as species like *Pseudonupedia intersecta* (1829) and *Pegomya winthemi*.  \n\nIn later years, Meigen continued his taxonomic work, describing *Wagneria nigrans* and *Peteina erinaceus* in 1830, and *Helicophagella melanura* in 1826. He contributed to the classification of *Tachina signata* (1824, later reclassified as *Amobia signata*), *Hydrophoria albiceps*, and *Phaonia serva*. Some of his species, such as *615四点芒蝇* and *亮绿蝇* (*Lucilia sericata*), are cited in Chinese literature, reflecting his global influence. Meigen’s descriptions often served as foundational references, with species like *Sarcophaga haematodes* (1826) and *Coenosia ambulans* (1826) remaining key in entomological studies.  \n\nDespite occasional inconsistencies in the data (e.g., conflicting years for *Siphona* genus establishment, likely a typographical error), Meigen’s legacy as a meticulous classifier of flies is undisputed. His work in the *Transactions of the American Entomological Society* (1838) and the *Zoological Journal* further underscores his international impact. By establishing genera and describing hundreds of species, Meigen laid critical groundwork for modern dipteran systematics, with his 1826 publications being among his most cited achievements. His contributions to the taxonomy of *Hydrophoria*, *Lucilia*, and *Phaonia* genera, as well as species like *Drino lota* (1824) and *Pales pavida* (蓝黑栉寄蝇), remain pivotal in entomological research.\",121\n1453,PEGOMYA WINTHEMI,\"\n\n**Pegomya wintehmi** is a species of fly within the genus *Pegomya*, first described by Meigen in 1826. It is characterized by dark-colored legs, with the dark pigmentation at least present on the knee, tarsus, or the outer dorsal side of the femur. The axillary scales of the species are distinctly yellow, and the lower axillary scales are significantly longer than the upper ones. Morphologically, the fifth abdominal plate exhibits short lateral lobes, measuring approximately one-quarter the length of the base. Additionally, the abdominal tergites (dorsal segments of the abdomen) are yellow, and the fifth abdominal tergite itself is described as short. The body length of *Pegomya wintehmi* is approximately 5 mm. \n\nGeographically, the species is distributed across multiple regions, including **Liaoning, China**, **Japan**, **Europe** (with **Germany** noted as the type locality), and **North America**. This wide range suggests a cosmopolitan or at least a transcontinental presence, though specific ecological preferences or dispersal mechanisms are not detailed in the provided data. The inclusion of Germany as the type locality aligns with the historical context of its 1826 description, while its occurrence in Liaoning and Japan highlights its presence in East Asia. The mention of North America further expands its known distribution, indicating it is not restricted to a single continent. \n\nThe descriptions provided are largely consistent, with minor variations in emphasis. Both highlight the species’ yellow abdominal features, though the first specifies the fifth abdominal plate’s lateral lobes and the second refers to the fifth abdominal tergite. These can be reconciled as complementary details, as the tergite and plate are anatomically related structures. Similarly, the leg coloration is described in the first account, while the second focuses on abdominal characteristics, with no conflicting information. The body length of 5 mm is explicitly stated in the first description and implicitly supported by the second, which does not contradict this measurement. \n\nIn summary, *Pegomya wintehmi* is a small, yellow-marked fly species with distinct leg pigmentation and abdominal morphology, occurring in East Asia, Europe, and North America. Its taxonomic history, physical traits, and geographic range collectively define its identity and ecological context.\",5\n1092,LEUCOPHORA SPONSA,\"Leucophora sponsa is a species described by Meigen in 1826, found in Heilongjiang (Yichun Wuying) and Shanxi (Taiyuan) domestically\",4\n5763,BACTROMYIA AURULENTA,\"A species in the Bactromyia genus with a black abdomen, black antennae, and a closed fifth radial cell in the wing.

The species is also known by the Chinese common name 三角池蝇 (\"\"Sanjiao chiying\"\"), which translates to \"\"triangular midge\"\" or \"\"triangular chironomid,\"\" likely referencing its morphological features. Morphologically, *Limnophora triangula* is characterized by a body length of 3–4 mm, a key identifier for distinguishing it from other species within the genus. Specific details about antennae segments are mentioned in the first description, though the exact structure or count is not elaborated. As a member of the *Limnophora* genus, it is part of the subfamily Orthocladiinae, which includes small to medium-sized midges often found in freshwater habitats. The species’ name \"\"triangula\"\" may allude to a triangular shape in certain anatomical structures, such as the head or thorax, though this is not explicitly detailed in the provided descriptions. The publication *Dipt.

No contradictory information is present in the descriptions, which align on the taxonomic placement, publication source, and basic morphological traits. The summary integrates both the scientific and Chinese nomenclature, emphasizing the species’ classification, size, and historical context.

Meigen, a prominent figure in 19th-century taxonomy, is credited with the formal classification of this species, which is part of the genus *Pegomya*. The descriptions provided consistently attribute the original identification of *Pegomya winthemi* to Meigen in the same year, 1826, with no conflicting information. The species name \"\"winthemi\"\" is derived from its association with the genus *Pegomya*, a group of flies commonly known for their role in plant-feeding and ecological interactions. Meigen’s work on *Pegomya winthemi* contributes to the broader understanding of Diptera taxonomy, particularly in documenting species within the *Pegomya* genus. No additional details about the species’ morphology, habitat, or behavior are included in the provided data, but the core fact of its description by Meigen in 1826 is reiterated. This summary consolidates the two descriptions into a single, coherent account, emphasizing the taxonomic contribution of Meigen to the species *Pegomya winthemi*.
