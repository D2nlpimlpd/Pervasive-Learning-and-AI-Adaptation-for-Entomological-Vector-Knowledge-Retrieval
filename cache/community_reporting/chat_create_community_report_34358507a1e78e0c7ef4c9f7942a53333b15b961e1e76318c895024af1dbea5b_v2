SUEC.** is an academic journal that served as a key publication for entomological research, particularly in the 19th century. The journal's full title, *Monographia Muscis Suecica*, translates to \"\"Monograph on Swedish Flies,\"\" reflecting its focus on documenting and classifying fly species native to Sweden. In 1823, it was the venue for the original description of *Spilogona litorea litorea*, a species within the genus *Spilogona* (family Muscidae). This entry marked a significant contribution to the taxonomy of flies, establishing the species' scientific nomenclature and initial classification.  \n\nAdditionally, the journal is referenced in relation to the description of *圆斑莠蝇* (Musca), a Chinese name for a species of fly. While the scientific name \"\"Musca\"\" typically refers to the housefly genus, the specific context here aligns with the 1823 publication in *MON. MUSC. SUEC.*, suggesting that the species in question may be a distinct member of the Muscidae family or a related group. The use of the Chinese name *圆斑莠蝇* (\"\"Spotted Housefly\"\") indicates regional recognition of the species, though the journal's primary role was to provide a formal taxonomic framework for Swedish fauna.  \n\nThe 1823 issue of *MON. MUSC. SUEC.* thus contains two notable entries: the formal description of *Spilogona litorea litorea* and the documentation of *圆斑莠蝇* (Musca), both underscoring the journal's historical importance in entomology. While the exact relationship between these two species remains unclear due to differing nomenclature (one using a Latinized scientific name and the other a vernacular-Chinese term with a genus-level identifier), the journal's role as a source for their 1823 descriptions is consistent. This highlights its dual function in both scientific classification and regional species identification during the early 19th century.  \n\nThe journal's legacy lies in its foundational work for Swedish entomology, providing a taxonomic baseline for species like *Spilogona litorea litorea* and contributing to the broader understanding of fly biodiversity. Its 1823 publications remain critical for modern researchers tracing the historical classification of these organisms. The mention of *圆斑莠蝇* (Musca) also suggests potential cross-regional taxonomic connections, though further study would be required to reconcile the naming conventions and confirm whether these entries refer to the same or distinct species. Overall, *MON. MUSC. SUEC.* exemplifies the role of 19th-century monographs in advancing systematic biology.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",2\n2665,SPILOGONA LITOREA LITOREA,\"Spilogona litorea litorea is a subspecies described in 1823 by Fallen, with distribution in the Soviet Union and Europe\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1494,圆斑莠蝇EUSTALOMYIA HILARIS,FALLEN,Fallen first described 圆斑莠蝇 in 1823,52\n1491,MON.
