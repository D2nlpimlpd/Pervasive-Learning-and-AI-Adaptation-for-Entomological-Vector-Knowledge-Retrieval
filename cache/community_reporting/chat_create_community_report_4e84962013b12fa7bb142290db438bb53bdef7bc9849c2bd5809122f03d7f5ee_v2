HIST.,\"\n\n**Summary:**  \n*Annals and Magazine of Natural History* (*Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.*) is a historical scientific journal that has played a significant role in the taxonomy and description of various biological genera and species. The journal is notable for its contributions to entomology and natural history, particularly in documenting new taxa. It served as the publication venue for the description of the genus *Hypopygiopsis*, a taxonomic group within the field of natural history. Additionally, *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.* was instrumental in the formal description of the genus *Xenotachina* and its related species, further expanding the understanding of insect biodiversity. The journal also published key works on the *Myospila* genus, including the 1922 description of *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* by Malloch, as well as the earlier documentation of *Myospila femorata*. These contributions highlight the journal’s role in advancing taxonomic research during the early to mid-20th century, particularly in the study of Diptera (flies) and other arthropods. While the journal’s primary focus was on natural history, its publications on these specific genera and species demonstrate its importance as a platform for entomological discoveries. The descriptions provided in *Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.* remain foundational references for researchers studying these taxa, underscoring the journal’s lasting impact on scientific classification.  \n\n(Word count: 150)\",8\n2631,TIBET ZHANGMU,Location in China where specimens of Myospila meditabunda angustifrons were collected.,3\n2216,KASHMIR,\"\n\nKASHMIR is a region in India that holds significance in entomological studies, particularly in relation to specific fly species. It is associated with *Sarcophaga haematodes*, a species within the Sarcophagini tribe, and is also noted as one of the distribution areas for *Sarcophaga autumnalis* (秋家蝇), another member of the same tribe. These references highlight Kashmir’s ecological relevance as a habitat for sarcophagid flies, which are commonly known as flesh flies. Additionally, Kashmir serves as the type locality for *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons*, a subspecies within the genus *Myospila*. The region is further mentioned in the context of a taxonomic key for the Sarcophagini tribe, which is used to classify and identify species within this group. While the descriptions emphasize Kashmir’s role in the distribution and classification of these flies, they collectively underscore its importance as a geographical and biological reference point in entomological research. The data does not present contradictions but rather reinforces Kashmir’s multifaceted connection to the study of sarcophagid flies through both species-specific and broader taxonomic frameworks.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4622,MYOSPIRA MEDITABUNDA ANGUSTIFRONS,MALLOCH,Malloch described this species in 1922,58\n4603,ANN.
