Additionally, MENG is recognized as the author of the 1982 scientific description of *Atherigona ligurriens*, a species within the same genus. Their research contributions span at least two distinct species in the *Atherigona* genus, with one study dating back to 1944b (a notation typically indicating a second publication by the same author in the same year). While the specific focus of the 1944b study is not detailed, it is clear that MENG has maintained a long-term engagement with *Atherigona* species, contributing to both foundational and later taxonomic work. The connection between their 1944b research and the 1982 description of *A. ligurriens* remains unspecified, but the timeline suggests a career dedicated to entomological or taxonomic studies. MENG’s work on *A. yiwulushan* and *A. ligurriens* highlights their role in advancing knowledge of these species, though further details about their methodologies, findings, or institutional affiliations are not provided in the descriptions. The use of \"\"1944b\"\" implies a need to reference specific publications for a complete understanding of their early contributions, while their 1982 work marks a definitive taxonomic milestone for *A. ligurriens*.
