His work primarily focused on Diptera (flies), with notable contributions to the classification of species within the genera *Delia*, *Blaesoxipha*, *Sarcophaga*, *Roeselia*, *Robineauella*, and *Hydrophoria*. \n\nIn 1896, Pandelle authored descriptions for several species, including *Roeselia atricula*, *Blaesoxipha gladiatrix*, *Blaesoxipha cochlearis*, *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) tuberosa*, *Peteina laticeps*, *Meigenia grandigena*, *Robineauella scoparia*, and *Sarcophaga scoparia*. He also described the species *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (likely a Chinese name for a fly species, possibly *Delia interflua* or another *Delia* species) in the same year. Additionally, he is credited with the type species *Sarcophaga incisilobata* and *Sarcophaga subulata*, though the exact year for these is unspecified in the data. \n\nBy 1900, Pandelle expanded his taxonomic work to include *Nupedia patellans* and *Delia flabellifera*. However, there is a discrepancy in the data regarding *Delia interflua*: some sources cite its description in 1896, while others attribute it to 1900. This inconsistency may reflect differing publication records or a typographical error, but the 1896 date is more frequently mentioned. Similarly, *Eglconcomitans* (possibly a misspelling of *Egle concomitans*) is listed as a species he described, though the year is unclear. \n\nPandelle’s contributions to the genus *Meigenia* included the 1896 description of *Meigenia grandigena*, and he was also associated with the classification of *Hydrophoria annulata*, though the nature of this involvement (e.g., description, revision) is unspecified. His work on *Blaesoxipha* and *Sarcophaga* species highlights his expertise in fly taxonomy, particularly in defining morphological and ecological distinctions within these groups. \n\nDespite the lack of detailed biographical information, Pandelle’s legacy is preserved through his meticulous species descriptions, which remain foundational in entomological literature. His 1896 publications, in particular, demonstrate a prolific output, covering a range of species that span both well-established and less commonly referenced genera. The conflicting dates for *Delia interflua* and *Egle concomitans* suggest the need for further verification in taxonomic databases, but his overall impact on the field is evident through the enduring use of his nomenclature. \n\nIn summary, Pandelle was a key figure in late 19th-century entomology, with a focus on Diptera taxonomy. His work on *Delia*, *Blaesoxipha*, *Sarcophaga*, and other genera provided critical classifications, though some records require reconciliation to clarify publication timelines. His scientific rigor and breadth of contributions underscore his significance in the study of insect biodiversity.

Morphologically, it is characterized by yellow basal scales and a body length of approximately 6.5 mm, distinguishing it from other members of the genus. The species is distributed across two distinct geographic regions: Menyuan in Qinghai Province, China, and the Pyrenees mountain range in Europe. These locations suggest a possible disjunct distribution pattern, which may reflect historical biogeographic events or ecological adaptability. While the first description notes \"\"unspecified but related morphological features,\"\" the second provides specific details, indicating that the species’ defining traits include the yellow basal scales and its moderate size. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as the latter elaborates on the former. Delia interflua is thus recognized as a 6.5 mm-long fly with yellow basal scales, documented in both East Asia and Europe, and formally classified under the genus *Delia* by Pandelle. Its presence in Qinghai and the Pyrenees highlights its range across diverse ecosystems, though further research may be needed to clarify its ecological preferences or life history traits. The species remains a subject of taxonomic and geographic interest due to its dual continental occurrence.\",3\n4695,REVUE ENT.,\"\n\n**REVUE ENT.** (Revue Entomologique) is an entomological journal that has played a significant role in the formal description of species within the genus *Blaesoxipha*. The journal is noted as the publication venue where *Blaesoxipha cochlearis* was first described, establishing its importance in the taxonomic documentation of this species. Additionally, *Blaesoxipha gladiatrix* was described in the same journal in 1896, further highlighting **REVUE ENT.** as a key platform for entomological research and species classification during the late 19th century. These two descriptions underscore the journal's historical contribution to the study of *Blaesoxipha* and its role in advancing entomological science. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as they reference distinct species and their respective publication details.

It is recognized as a key area for the distribution of several insect species, including *Miltogramma brevipilum*, a fly species documented in the region. Additionally, Turkestan serves as a habitat for two other notable fly species: *Polybuphthalmus multipunctatus* (多斑聚蜂麻蝇) and *Polybuphthalmus splendidus* (华丽聚蜂麻蝇), both of which are associated with the area. The region is also home to *Robineauella scoparia*, a species of hoverfly, further underscoring its ecological importance as a biodiversity hotspot for Diptera. While the descriptions provided do not specify exact habitats or ecological roles of these species, their presence in Turkestan highlights the region’s role in supporting diverse arthropod populations. The mention of the Soviet Union in one description reflects historical administrative divisions, as Turkestan was a term used to describe territories under Russian/Soviet influence before the dissolution of the USSR. All references collectively emphasize Turkestan’s significance as a geographic and ecological zone where these species coexist, though further details on their interactions or conservation status within the region remain unspecified. The inclusion of both scientific and Chinese common names (e.g., 多斑聚蜂麻蝇 and 华丽聚蜂麻蝇) suggests the region’s relevance in entomological studies across different linguistic and cultural contexts. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as they consistently identify Turkestan as a shared distribution area for the listed species, with the Soviet Union reference providing historical context rather than conflicting with the broader regional definition.
