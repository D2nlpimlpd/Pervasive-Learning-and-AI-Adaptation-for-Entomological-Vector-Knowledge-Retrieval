This genus is part of the broader Diptera order and is known for its ecological roles in decomposition and nutrient cycling. Additionally, Vietnam is home to the specific species *Isomyia pseudolucilia* (Isomyia pseudolucilia), which belongs to the *Sphaeroceridae* family. The presence of both the genus and this particular species highlights Vietnam's biodiversity and its significance as a habitat for various fly species. While the descriptions provided focus on taxonomic distribution, they collectively underscore Vietnam's role in supporting the *Sphaeroceridae* family and its associated species within the region's ecosystems. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they align in identifying Vietnam as a shared location for the genus and the species.\",3\n5237,峨眉亚麻蝇,\"A species of fly (Parasarcophaga doleschalli) described by Johnston et Tiegs in 1921, with distinct morphological features including 5-6 dorsal bristles and a unique genital structure.
