Active in both taxonomic research and ecological documentation, KANO's work spans multiple regions, including Japan, Micronesia, and Taiwan, and involves collaborations with other scientists. Their earliest recorded contribution dates to 1950, when they described the species *拟野亚麻蝇* (likely *Ph. fuscitibia* or a related *Phaonia* species). In 1953 and 1954, KANO authored multiple references to *1339上海细麻蝇* (possibly *Ph. xanthofemina*), and in 1956, they co-described *Sarcophaga furutonensis* with Okazaki and *Sarcophaga shiroganensis* with another collaborator.  \n\nKANO's 1960s work includes foundational studies on the genus *Xanthotryxus* in 1968, as well as co-authoring a 1968 study on fly species characteristics referenced in broader literature. They were also involved in documenting the distribution of flies in Micronesia in 1968, alongside other researchers. Notably, KANO described the species *Melinda itoi* in 1962 and co-authored a 1968 study on *Melinda* species. In 1964, they co-described *Robineauella (D.) uemotoi*, and in 1966, they contributed to the description of *Protocalliphora maruyamensis*. Additionally, KANO is cited as an author for the type locality of *Brontaea ezensis* and for studies on *Phaonia bambusa*, *Phaonia luteovittata*, and *Phaonia ryukyuensis*.  \n\nThe 1970s saw KANO's continued focus on taxonomic classifications, including co-establishing the *Horia* genus in 1967 and studying the genus *Neomyia* in 1973. They also co-described *Sarcosolomonia harinasutai* in 1977 and *Ophyra okazakii* in 1971. In 1973, KANO was associated with a report on fly species, and their work on *Stomoxys uruma* (co-described with Shinonaga in 1966) and *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Paradichosia tsukamotoi* further highlights their expertise in dipteran taxonomy.  \n\nKANO's research also extended to the 1980s, with studies on species differences in 1983 and 1987. They were cited for specimen collection in Japan and for the distribution of *Pyrellia cyanicolor* in Taiwan. Their collaborations often involved prominent entomologists, as seen in co-authoring works on *Gymnadichosia pusilla* and *Pollenomyia okazakii*.  \n\nOverall, KANO's career reflects a deep engagement with the taxonomy and ecology of flies, particularly within the *Phaonia*, *Melinda*, and *Sarcophaga* genera. Their work, frequently collaborative, advanced the understanding of species distribution, morphological characteristics, and regional biodiversity in Asia. Key publications include studies on *Xanthotryxus* (1968), *Horia* (1967), and multiple *Phaonia* species, alongside contributions to the classification of *Stomoxys uruma* and *Ophyra okazakii*.
