It is renowned for its unique biodiversity, with a significant proportion of its flora and fauna found nowhere else on Earth. The country serves as a critical habitat for various endemic and native species, including the insect *Exorista xanthaspis*, a species of fly distributed within its ecosystems. Additionally, Madagascar is home to the species 绯角亚麻蝇 (*Exorista xanthaspis*), which is also native to the region. These two descriptions refer to the same species, as \"\"绯角亚麻蝇\"\" is the Chinese name for *Exorista xanthaspis*, a parasitoid fly belonging to the Tachinidae family. The fly is known for its ecological role in regulating populations of other insects, particularly herbivorous pests, through parasitism. Its presence in Madagascar highlights the island’s importance as a biodiversity hotspot, where specialized species have evolved in isolation due to the country’s geographic separation from mainland Africa. While the descriptions provided are consistent in identifying Madagascar as the distribution site for *Exorista xanthaspis*, further details about the species’ specific habitats, behaviors, or conservation status in Madagascar are not included in the data. The country’s diverse environments, ranging from rainforests to arid regions, likely support the fly’s life cycle and interactions with host species. Overall, Madagascar’s ecological uniqueness underscores its role in harboring such specialized organisms, contributing to global biological diversity. (Word count: 150)\",1\n14,巴西,,3\n15,PROF. H. S.
