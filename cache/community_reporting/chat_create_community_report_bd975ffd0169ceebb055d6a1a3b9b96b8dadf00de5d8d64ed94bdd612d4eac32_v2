Malloch’s research was published in prominent entomological journals such as *Annals and Magazine of Natural History*, *Zoologische Anzeiger (Leipzig)*, and *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica*.  \n\nHe described numerous species across his career, including *Atherigona oryzae* (1925), *Atherigona tridens* (1928), *Atherigona simplex* (1925), *Atherigona atripalpis*, *Atherigona confusa*, and the Chinese-named species 黄足璃蝇 (*Isomyia cupreoviridis*) and 半透璃蝇 (*Isomyia pseudolucilia*).

His work on *Musca formosana*, the first description of the species in 1925, earned him recognition as the initial describer of the \"\"Taiwan housefly.\"\" Additionally, he contributed to the taxonomy of *Isomyia* with *Isomyia cupreoviridis* (1928) and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, as well as *Myospila flavibasis* (1925) and *Myospila femorata* (1935).  \n\nMalloch’s studies extended to ecological observations, including research on fly larvae ecology in 1923 and 1929, and a 1927 study on the distribution of *Hemipyrellia ligurriens* in Sulawesi, Indonesia. He also authored a 1927 study on fly species and a 1930 study (specific details unspecified). Among his notable works are the descriptions of *Eutrichota labradorensis* (1920) and *Eutrichota magna* (year unspecified), as well as *Xenosia tarsalia* and *Xenosia scutellaris* (both 1935). He was cited for documenting *Thricops coquilletti* (1920) and *Haematobia australis* (1932), and for the species *Tainanina sarcophagoides* (1931) and *Bengalia (Eubengalia) emarginata* (1927).  \n\nHis publications included species such as *Chaetolispa* (1922) and *Xenolispa* (1923), and he described *Neohelina* in 1924. Malloch’s work on *Nupedia fulva* (1934) and *Hebecnema affinis* (1921) further highlights his focus on dipteran taxonomy.

The **frons width** is approximately **1/5 of the head width**, emphasizing a relatively narrow central region of the head. Their **eyes** are notable for having a **height significantly greater than their length**, creating a vertically elongated appearance. Additionally, the **lower half of the eye is distinctly concave**, a characteristic that differentiates them from closely related genera. Beyond head features, CEPHALISPA is also recognized for **distinct wing features**, though specific details about these traits are not elaborated in the provided data. The combination of these head and wing characteristics solidifies their classification within the Coenosiini tribe, which is known for diverse and specialized morphological adaptations among fruit flies.

It is taxonomically distinct from the closely related genus *Pegomya*, primarily due to its unique morphological and ecological characteristics. Morphologically, Emmesomyia species are notable for their conical abdomens, a feature that differentiates them from many other syrphid genera. Additionally, they possess setae (bristles) at the junctions of the fourth and fifth radial veins on their wings, a diagnostic trait used in their classification. \n\nEcologically, the genus is characterized by **larval coprophagy**, meaning the larvae feed on decaying organic matter, particularly animal feces. This dietary specialization contrasts with the broader feeding habits observed in *Pegomya*, where larvae often consume plant material or fungi. The combination of these morphological and ecological traits—conical abdomens, setae at specific wing vein junctions, and a reliance on coprophagous larval nutrition—establishes Emmesomyia as a distinct group within the syrphid family.

The larvae of *PEGOMYA* species are herbivorous, feeding on plant material, which sets them apart from other fly genera with different larval diets, such as carnivorous or detritivorous habits. This herbivorous trait is a defining feature of the genus and plays a significant role in its ecological niche. While the original description by R.-D. in 1830 established the genus, subsequent taxonomic work has reinforced its separation from *Emmesomyia*, ensuring clarity in its classification. *PEGOMYA* remains a recognized group within the broader context of fly taxonomy, with its unique larval feeding behavior contributing to its scientific and ecological relevance. The genus is part of the family Muscidae, though specific subfamily or tribal affiliations may require further clarification depending on the source. Overall, *PEGOMYA* is characterized by its historical taxonomic foundation, distinct separation from *Emmesomyia*, and the herbivorous nature of its immature stages, which collectively define its identity in entomological studies. (Word count: 120)\",6\n2450,ANN.MAG.NAT.HIST.,\"\n\nThe *Annals and Magazine of Natural History* (ANN.MAG.NAT.HIST.) is a journal published by the organization of the same name, historically recognized for its contributions to the classification and study of fly species. The journal has served as a platform for entomological research, particularly in documenting new or notable species within the Diptera order. Among the species described in its pages are *Isomyia cupreoviridis* and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, both of which are associated with the genus *Isomyia*. The latter, *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, was specifically described by the entomologist Malloch in 1928, highlighting the journal’s role in advancing taxonomic work during the early 20th century. While the exact publication dates for *Isomyia cupreoviridis* are not specified in the provided data, its inclusion in the journal underscores the publication’s significance in the field of natural history and dipteran taxonomy. The *Annals and Magazine of Natural History* remains a key reference for historical entomological studies, preserving detailed descriptions and classifications that continue to inform modern research. Its legacy reflects the collaborative efforts of scientists to systematically categorize biodiversity, with a particular emphasis on insect species. The journal’s association with these fly species demonstrates its utility in both academic and scientific communities for disseminating specialized taxonomic findings.\",3\n4310,XIAOMENGYANG,\"Location in Yunnan, China, part of the distribution for Isomyia cupreoviridis\",2\n2639,LASIOPELTA ORIENTALIS,\"Type species of the genus Lasiopelta, described by Malloch in 1928.\",1\n514,MELANESIA,\"\n\n**Melanesia** is a geographical region in the Pacific Ocean, encompassing parts of Oceania and Southeast Asia, including countries such as Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia. It is characterized by its diverse ecosystems, ranging from tropical rainforests to coastal and island habitats, which support a wide array of biodiversity. The region is notable for being a key area in the distribution of certain fly species, particularly those within the genus *Dichaetomyia* and the genus *Emmesomyia*.  \n\nThe species *Dichaetomyia quadrata* is specifically documented as being distributed in Melanesia, highlighting the region's ecological significance for this particular fly. Additionally, the broader genus *Dichaetomyia*, which includes multiple species, is also found in Melanesia as part of its international distribution. This suggests that while *Dichaetomyia quadrata* is localized to the region, other *Dichaetomyia* species may have a more global presence, with Melanesia serving as one of their habitats.  \n\nMelanesia is similarly recognized as a distributional range for the genus *Emmesomyia*, a group of flies within the family Stratiomyidae. The presence of *Emmesomyia* in the region underscores Melanesia's role in supporting unique and diverse insect populations, likely influenced by its tropical climate and isolated island environments.  \n\nIn summary, Melanesia functions as a critical ecological hub for both *Dichaetomyia quadrata* and the genus *Emmesomyia*, with the region hosting specific species of *Dichaetomyia* and contributing to the international distribution of the genus. These findings reflect the area's importance in entomological studies and its role in preserving the habitats of specialized fly species. The combination of localized and broader distribution patterns emphasizes the need for further research into the region's biodiversity and the ecological factors that sustain these species.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",2\n513,MALUKU,Maluku is a geographic region in Indonesia where the genus Emmesomyia is distributed,1\n1506,BROOKLYN ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY,Organization publishing works on Pegomya and Emmesomyia,2\n1507,RECORD OF THE INDIAN MUSEUM,Publication documenting Emmesomyia flavitarsis and Emmesomyia socia suwai,2\n3001,LUZON,An island in the Philippines where the FLAVOCAUDATA DICHAETOMYIA is distributed (type locality).,1\n4005,JOURN.
