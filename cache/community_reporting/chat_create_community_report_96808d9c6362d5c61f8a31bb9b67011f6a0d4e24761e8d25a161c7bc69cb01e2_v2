Established as a key publication in entomological research, it has documented numerous species descriptions and revisions since the mid-20th century. The journal has served as a platform for studies on diverse taxa, including but not limited to the following:  \n\n- **Tachinid Flies**: It provides detailed taxonomic work on Tachinidae, such as *Metoposisyrops scirpophagae* and *Myxexoristops blondeli*, emphasizing their classification and geographic distribution.  \n- **Phaonia Species**: Multiple Phaonia species have been described or classified in the journal, including *Phaonia septentrionalis*, *Phaonia fusciaurea*, *Phaonia decussatoides*, *Phaonia apicaloides*, *Phaonia cothurnoloba*, *Phaonia graciloides* (1985), and *Phaonia brunneiabdomina*. These studies often address morphological characteristics and phylogenetic relationships.  \n- **Limnophora Flies**: The journal has published descriptions of *Limnophora argentitriangula* (1979) and other species like *Limnophora interfrons* and *Limnophora latiorbitalis*.  \n- **Other Notable Species**: It includes the 1964 description of *Heteronychia quoi* and *Sarcophaga parva* (1952), as well as the 1965 publication of *Protophomia terraenovae*. Additionally, *Caricea boops* and the Sichuan Spring Fly (described in issue 5(3):274) are among the species documented.  \n- **Genera and Families**: Research on genera such as *Pegohylemyia*, *Polleniopsis* (e.g., *Polleniopsis mongolica* [Seguy, 1928] and *Polleniopsis cuonaensis* [Chen et Fan, 1991]), and *Phallosphaera amica* (1964) further highlights its role in advancing knowledge of Diptera taxonomy.  \n\nThe journal has been instrumental in publishing works by Chinese researchers like Chen and Fan, as well as international collaborations, such as the 1928 *Polleniopsis mongolica* study by Seguy. Its contributions span decades, with records dating back to 1952 and continuing through 1991. While primarily focused on entomology, it also addresses broader zoological classifications, as seen in the 1979 description of *Bellardia menechmoides* by Chen. The Chinese name, 动物分类学报, underscores its mission as a taxonomic resource for zoological sciences in China.  \n\nIn summary, *Acta Zoologica Sinica* is a pivotal academic journal in Chinese zoology, renowned for its rigorous taxonomic studies on flies and other invertebrates. It bridges regional and global research by documenting species from various families, including Tachinidae, and providing critical insights into their morphology, distribution, and classification. Its historical publications and continued relevance make it a vital reference for entomologists and taxonomists.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",65\n3334,GULIN,,1\n3335,GUYAUN,,1\n2724,LIMNOPHORA FALLAX SEPTENTRIONALIS,\"Limnophora fallax septentrionalis is a species of fly described in Acta Zoologica Sinica, 9(4):382, 图29-34 with a gray-brown frons and body length of 3.8-4.6 mm)|\",3\n5515,CHAO ET SHI,\"\n\nChao et Shi are taxonomists recognized for their contributions to zoological classification.

Both species descriptions are attributed to their collaborative efforts, underscoring their significance in advancing the understanding of taxonomic groups within zoology. Their publications in *Acta Zoologica Sinica* and other scientific contexts reflect their engagement with academic research and their commitment to systematic biology.
