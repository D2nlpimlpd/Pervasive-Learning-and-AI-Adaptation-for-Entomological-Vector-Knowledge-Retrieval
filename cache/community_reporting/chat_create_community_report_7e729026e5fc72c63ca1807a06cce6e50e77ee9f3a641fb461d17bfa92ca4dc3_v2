Adult members of this subfamily are notable for their arc-shaped m1+2 wing veins, a key taxonomic trait that differentiates them from other calliphorid groups. Female Calliphorinae also possess a telescopic ovipositor, an adaptation that facilitates efficient egg-laying. In contrast, larval characteristics exhibit variability, as some species within the subfamily have larvae with pharyngeal appendages, while others do not. This diversity in larval morphology suggests potential ecological or functional adaptations among different species.  \n\nThe subfamily includes species such as *Hypopygiopsis infumata* and *Hemipyrellia ligurriens*, which are representative of its taxonomic breadth. These species, along with others in Calliphorinae, are part of the broader Calliphoridae family, commonly known as blow flies or bottle flies, which are often associated with carrion, decaying organic matter, or plant material as larval food sources. However, specific ecological roles within Calliphorinae may vary depending on the presence or absence of larval pharyngeal appendages, which could influence feeding behaviors or habitat preferences.  \n\nBy integrating the defining adult traits (arc-shaped wing veins and telescopic ovipositor) with the variable larval features (pharyngeal appendage presence), Calliphorinae represents a taxonomically distinct yet ecologically diverse group within the Calliphoridae. Its members contribute to decomposition processes and are subjects of interest in forensic entomology and ecological studies. The inclusion of both fixed and variable characteristics underscores the importance of comprehensive morphological analysis in classifying and understanding this subfamily.\",2\n3695,HYPOPYGIOPSIS INFUMATA,,4\n6188,DECAYING ANIMAL CARCASSES,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11954,CALLIPHORINAE,HYPOPYGIOPSIS INFUMATA,Hypopygiopsis infumata is part of the Calliphorinae subfamily,6\n11955,HYPOPYGIOPSIS INFUMATA,DECAYING ANIMAL CARCASSES,Hypopygiopsis infumata larvae breed in decaying animal carcasses,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
