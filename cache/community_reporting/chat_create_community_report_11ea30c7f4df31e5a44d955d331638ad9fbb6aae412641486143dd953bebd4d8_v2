The province hosts a wide array of dipteran genera and species, many of which are associated with specific localities such as Tianmu Mountain, Hangzhou, Fuyang, Zhoushan, Yiwu, Beiyandangshan, and Moganshan. These regions serve as key distribution sites and type localities for various taxa, reflecting Zhejiang’s ecological importance in entomological studies.  \n\nZhejiang is home to multiple genera and species of flies, including **Atherigona** (*A. reversura*, *A. triglomerata*), **Eutrichota** (*E. gigas*, type locality at Tianmu Mountain), **Musca** (*M. autumnalis*, *M. convexifrons*, *M. conducens*, *M. sorbens*), and **Thecocarcelia** (*T. parnarae*, *T. laticornis*). The province also supports **Argyrophylax** (*A. phoeda*, *A. nigrotibialis*), **Parasarcophaga** (*P. albiceps*, *P. brevicornis*, *P. macroauriculata*, *P. polystylata*, *P. idmais*), and **Tachina** (*T. nupta*, *T. noctuarum*), alongside **Servillia ardens** and **Exorista jugoslavica**. Notably, **Syngamoptera chekiangensis** is endemic to Zhejiang, with Tianmu Mountain as its type locality, and the province is also a distribution site for **1430筒须新怯寄蝇** and **1431家蚕追寄蝇**.  \n\nThe region is a critical habitat for **Gonia** species (*G. klapperichi*, *G. chinensis*, *G. bimaculata*), **Carcelia** (*C. matsukarehae*, *C. ambigua*, *C. kockiana*), and **Sarcophaga** (including *S. polystylata* and *S. macroauriculata*). **Pegomya** is well-represented, with *P. spinulosa*, *P. phyllostachys*, *P. pachura*, *P. clavellata*, *P. lyrura*, and *P. japonica mokanensis* documented. **Graphomya rufitibia** is found in Hangzhou, Tianmu Mountain, and Jiangshan, while **Calliphora axata** is recorded in Hangzhou. **Brontaea tonitrui** and **Linnaemya** species are also present, as are **Hyleorus elatus** and **Voria ruralis**.  \n\nZhejiang’s biodiversity includes **Meigenia** (*M. grandigena* in Moganshan) and **Bessa** genera, alongside **Leucophora hangzhouensis**, **Fucellia apicalis**, and **Fucellia chinensis**. The province is notable for hosting **Sisyropa prominens** and **Drino inconspicua**, as well as **Cuphocera varia** and **Nupedia fulva**. Specific species like **1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly**, **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**, and **PIERRETIACAUDAGALLI** are documented, with **Rhyncomya setipyga** and **Sarcorohdendorfia** (*S. antilope*, *S. mimobasalis*) also occurring there.  \n\nAgricultural and ecological significance is evident, as Zhejiang is associated with species targeting pests such as the **Rice Borer** and **Rice Leafroller Moth**. The province supports **Muscina** species (including at Tianmu Mountain), **Haematobia**, and **Exorista larvarum**. Additionally, **Compsilura concinnata**, **Dinemomyia nigribasicosta**, and **Isomyia** (*I. electa*, *I. pichoni*, *I. pseudolucilia*) are recorded. **I. tripartita** and **Stomorhina obsoleta** are also found in the region.  \n\nZhejiang’s unique status as a type locality for **1393义乌亚麻蝇** (Yiwu) and **Syngamoptera chekiangensis** (Tianmu Mountain) underscores its role in taxonomic research. The province is further linked to **THICK RING BLACK FLY** (Tianmu Mountain, Beiyandangshan) and **翼阳细麻蝇** (Yiyang). Chinese names for species, such as **半透璃蝇**, **棕尾别麻蝇**, **绿翠蝇**, **东方粪泉蝇**, and **朔粪泉蝇**, are documented, with many tied to Tianmu Mountain.  \n\nIn summary, Zhejiang province in China is a hotspot for dipteran diversity, hosting over 50 species across 20+ genera, including several with restricted distributions or type localities. Its varied habitats, from mountainous regions like Tianmu Mountain to urban centers like Hangzhou, contribute to this richness, making it a vital area for studying fly ecology and taxonomy.\",107\n2087,YIWU,\"Yiwu is a city in Zhejiang province, China\",1\n2088,BEIYANEDANGSHAN,\"Beiyangedangshan is a city in Zhejiang province, China\",1\n2089,JIANGSHAN,\"Jiangshan is a city in Zhejiang province, China\",1\n5663,WUXING QIANJIN,Wuxing Qianjin is associated with the collection of specimens in Zhejiang for Shuangban Jiewei Jiying,1\n5664,LI XUELIOU,Li Xueliou is connected to the study of Shuangban Jiewei Jiying in Zhejiang,1\n5665,HE JUNHUA,\"\n\n**HE JUNHUA** is an individual associated with entomological activities in Zhejiang, China.

Additionally, HE JUNHUA has been identified as a person connected to the study or monitoring of the **Rice Leafroller Moth** (*Cnaphalocrocis medinalis*), a significant pest species affecting rice crops. This dual association suggests his involvement in both broader specimen collection efforts and targeted research on economically important insect species in Zhejiang. The context implies a focus on entomology, potentially within an academic, governmental, or agricultural framework, though specific details about his role (e.g., researcher, collector, or collaborator) or the objectives of \"\"Shuangban Jiewei Jiying\"\" remain unclear. His work likely contributes to understanding local insect populations, their ecological roles, or their impact on agriculture, with the Rice Leafroller Moth being a key species of interest due to its threat to rice cultivation.

HE JUNHUA’s connection to the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens suggests involvement in biological or ecological research, potentially related to plant or insect species native to the region. These specimens may represent a specific group of organisms or a research project focused on biodiversity, conservation, or agricultural pests.  \n\nAdditionally, HE JUNHUA’s association with the Rice Leafroller Moth in Zhejiang highlights their role in addressing a critical agricultural pest that threatens rice crops. The Rice Leafroller Moth is a significant insect in rice-growing areas, as its larvae feed on rice leaves, causing damage that reduces yields. Research on this species in Zhejiang likely centers on monitoring its population, understanding its life cycle, or developing pest management strategies to mitigate its impact on local agriculture. This work aligns with broader efforts in the province to sustain rice production, a staple of Zhejiang’s economy and food security.  \n\nWhile the descriptions do not explicitly clarify the relationship between the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens and the Rice Leafroller Moth, both associations underscore HE JUNHUA’s engagement with Zhejiang’s ecological and agricultural systems. The lack of direct overlap between the two topics implies that HE JUNHUA may contribute to multiple areas of study within the region, such as biodiversity documentation and pest control. Zhejiang’s role as a hub for both natural and agricultural research further contextualizes these associations, as the province supports initiatives to balance ecological preservation with sustainable farming practices.  \n\nIn summary, HE JUNHUA is linked to Zhejiang through their work on the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens and the Rice Leafroller Moth, reflecting a dual focus on regional biodiversity and agricultural challenges. Their contributions likely support scientific understanding and practical solutions for Zhejiang’s ecosystems and rice industry, though the exact nature of their research on the specimens remains unspecified.
