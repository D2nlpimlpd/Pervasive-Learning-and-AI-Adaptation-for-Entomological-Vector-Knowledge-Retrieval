It is distributed in Liaoning, Henan, Sichuan (domestically) and Japan (abroad).\",8\n700,LIANING,\"\n\n**Liaoning** is a province in northeastern China where multiple insect and fly species have been documented. The region is notable for its biodiversity, hosting distributions of several taxa, including *Meliniella* species, which are found in areas such as Benxi and Xinbin. Additionally, *Pegohylemyia tridentifera*, a species of fly, is recorded in Liaoning, further highlighting its ecological significance. The province also supports populations of *角缘花蝇* (a species of flower fly) and *古北蝗蝇* (a type of hoverfly), both of which are distributed in Benxi and Huanren. *Pegomya winthemi*, another fly species, is part of Liaoning’s domestic distribution range, underscoring its role as a habitat for diverse dipteran fauna. \n\nLiaoning has been identified as a site of parasitism involving *Chaetogena* flies, which target the poplar leafroller moth, an economically significant pest in agricultural and forestry contexts. This parasitic relationship contributes to the province’s ecological dynamics and pest control mechanisms. Furthermore, the species *Paradichosia scutellata* is documented in Liaoning, adding to the list of insects associated with the region. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Liaoning’s importance as a distribution hub for various insect species, particularly flies and their ecological interactions. While the entity name \"\"LIANING\"\" appears to be a typographical variation of \"\"Liaoning,\"\" all references align with the province’s documented biodiversity. The inclusion of specific locations like Benxi, Xinbin, and Huanren within Liaoning provides localized context for these species’ habitats. The data underscores the province’s role in supporting both native and potentially invasive insect populations, as well as its relevance in studies of parasitism and ecological balance. \n\nIn summary, Liaoning, a Chinese province in the northeast, is a key region for the distribution of *Meliniella*, *Pegohylemyia tridentifera*, *角缘花蝇*, *古北蝗蝇*, *Pegomya winthemi*, and *Paradichosia scutellata*. It also serves as a critical area for observing parasitic interactions involving *Chaetogena* flies and the poplar leafroller moth. The province’s varied ecosystems, including urban and rural zones around Benxi, Xinbin, and Huanren, support this rich insect diversity, making it a focal point for entomological research and ecological management.\",5\n1268,PEGOHYLEMIA GNAVA,\"A species of fly closely related to Pegohylemyia tridentifera, with differences in lateral face width, antennae bristles, and abdominal plate features.\",1\n1274,INSECTA MATSUM.,A publication event where Pegohylemyia tridentifera was described in 1986.,1\n5510,ZHANG SHIMIN,\"\n\n**ZHANG SHIMIN** is a researcher associated with the study of parasitism in the Liaoning region, focusing on the ecological interactions between parasitoid wasps and lepidopteran pests. Their work has specifically examined **Austrophorocera**, a genus of parasitoid wasps, and their role in parasitizing the **Poplar Defoliator** (a common name for the poplar leafroller moth, *Tortrix viridana* or related species), which is a significant defoliator of poplar trees. ZHANG SHIMIN documented the parasitism dynamics of these wasps on the poplar leafroller moth, contributing to understanding biological control mechanisms in forest ecosystems. The research highlights the importance of parasitoid wasps like *Austrophorocera* in regulating pest populations, particularly in the context of poplar forests in Liaoning, a region in northeastern China where such ecological studies are critical for sustainable forestry. By investigating the parasitism rates and host-parasitoid relationships, ZHANG SHIMIN’s findings support efforts to manage defoliator outbreaks through natural predators, aligning with broader conservation and agricultural practices in the area.
