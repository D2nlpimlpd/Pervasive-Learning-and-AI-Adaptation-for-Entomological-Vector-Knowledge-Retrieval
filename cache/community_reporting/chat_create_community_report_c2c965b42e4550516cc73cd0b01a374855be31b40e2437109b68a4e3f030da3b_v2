The type species, *Aplomyia confinis*, was originally described by Fallen in 1820. Members of this genus are characterized by their small, black bodies and distinctive morphological traits, including hairy compound eyes and a short fourth abdominal tergite. Additional diagnostic features include the presence of two frontal bristles and a row of black bristles located behind the postocular bristles on the occiput. Wing venation patterns and abdominal tergite structures further distinguish the genus within the Tachinidae family. \n\nGeographically, *Aplomyia* species are distributed across multiple regions, with documented occurrences in China (specifically in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Beijing, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Yunnan, and Tibet) as well as in Europe and Africa. This global presence highlights their adaptability to diverse ecosystems. The genus is known to parasitize a range of host species, including the butterfly *Aporia crataegi* and the moth *Dendrolimus sibiricus*, underscoring their ecological role in regulating insect populations. \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in defining *Aplomyia* as a tachinid fly genus with specific morphological and ecological attributes. While the first description emphasizes abdominal tergites and wing venation, the second and third add details about frontal bristles, occipital bristle arrangements, and the type species. These features collectively form a cohesive taxonomic profile. The inclusion of host species and regional distribution from the first description complements the morphological data, ensuring a comprehensive overview. No contradictions exist in the core information, allowing for a unified summary that integrates all aspects of the genus.\",14\n6028,羊狂蝇OESTRUS OVIS,\"羊狂蝇Oestrus ovis Linnaeus, 1758 is a species of fly in the Oestridae family, characterized by its short, broad wings with triangular black spots at the base, a rounded abdomen, and parasitic larvae that infest sheep nasal sinuses and human eyes. It is distributed in China's western and northwestern plateau regions, northern areas beyond the Huai River, and globally in the Palaearctic region. Adults appear from May to October.\",9\n2289,陕西,\"\n\nShaanxi, a province in northwest China, is a significant region for the distribution of various insect species. It is home to *Aplomyia*, as well as species such as *Lucilia shenyangensis* and *Lucilia hainanensis*. The genus *Protocalliphora azurea* is also documented in the province, alongside *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) jaroschevskyi*, which is noted as having a domestic distribution in Shaanxi. The genus *Helina*, including *Helina squamoflava* and *Helina pleuranthus*, is found domestically in the region. Additionally, *Phaonia xianensis* is recorded in Shaanxi, with Taibai Mountain serving as its type locality. The species 亚棕翅阳蝇 (likely a Chinese name for a specific fly species) is distributed within the province, as are certain *Gasterophilus* species, which are associated with equine botflies. \n\nShaanxi’s biodiversity includes the presence of *Oestrus ovis*, a botfly species, in multiple locations such as Suide, Dingbian, Yan’an, Huanglong Mountain, Xi’an, Shenmu, Jingbian, Wuqi, Baoji, and Feng County. The genus *Rypellia* is documented in Yulin, Yan’an, and other areas, as reported by the Fourth Military Medical University et al. in 1981. The province is also a distribution site for *Chrysomya* (斑麻蝇属), a genus of blowflies, and *Hypoderma* (牛皮蝇), commonly known as warble flies. Furthermore, the Crimson-legged Pattern Fly (绯胫纹蝇) is among the species recorded in Shaanxi. \n\nThese findings highlight Shaanxi’s ecological importance as a habitat for diverse fly species, including both common and regionally specific taxa. The province’s varied geography, from mountainous regions like Taibai Mountain to urban and rural areas, supports a range of entomological populations. Studies and records from institutions such as the Fourth Military Medical University contribute to understanding the local fauna, emphasizing Shaanxi’s role in the broader context of Chinese insect distribution. The coexistence of multiple genera and species, including those with medical or veterinary relevance, underscores the need for continued research in this region.\",15\n162,第四军医大学,\"\n\nThe Fourth Military Medical University (FMMU), a prominent institution in China, is recognized for its contributions to medical and scientific research. It has conducted entomological surveys on fly species in Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces, regions in northwestern China, as part of its efforts to study biodiversity, vector-borne diseases, or ecological health. These surveys likely involved fieldwork, species identification, and data analysis to support public health initiatives or environmental research. Additionally, the university is associated with Shen Yunzhong, an individual whose role or connection to FMMU remains unspecified in the provided data. This association could indicate a collaborative relationship, academic affiliation, or professional involvement in the university’s research projects. While the descriptions highlight distinct aspects of the university’s activities—entomological research and a connection to Shen Yunzhong—there is no contradiction between them, as they may reflect separate domains of engagement. The Fourth Military Medical University’s work in fly species surveys underscores its commitment to applied scientific research, while its link to Shen Yunzhong suggests potential contributions to its academic or operational framework. Together, these details illustrate the institution’s multifaceted role in advancing medical and ecological knowledge in China.\",3\n5246,非洲,\"\n\nAfrica is a continent where the genus *Aplomyia*, a group of fruit flies within the Tephritidae family, is distributed. Additionally, the species 绯角亚麻蝇 (Crimson Angle Flax Fly), which is also part of the Tephritidae family, is found in this region. Both descriptions collectively emphasize Africa's role as a habitat for these insect species, underscoring the continent's biodiversity in supporting various tephritid flies.
