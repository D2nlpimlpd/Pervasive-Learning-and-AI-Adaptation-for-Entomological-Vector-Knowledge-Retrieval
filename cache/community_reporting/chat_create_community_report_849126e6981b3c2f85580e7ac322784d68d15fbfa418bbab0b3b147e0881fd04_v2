Their work spanned multiple genera and families, with a focus on Diptera (true flies). STEIN first described the genus *Enneastigma* in 1916 and established *Pseudocoenosia* in the same year. They also described the genus *Euryomma* in 1899 and *Aphananeura* in 1907. Key species attributed to STEIN include *Drymeia spinifemorata* (1907), *Drymeia metatarsata* (1907), *Hydrophoria maculipennis* (1907), *Hydrophoria melaena* (1907), *Hydrophoria cinerascens* (1907), and *Hydrotaea spinosa* (1907).

They also contributed to the classification of *Dichaetomyia* species, including *Dichaetomyia pallicornis* (1915), *Dichaetomyia apicalis*, *Dichaetomyia pectinipes*, and *Dichaetomyia pallitarsis*. For the genus *Phaonia*, STEIN described *Phaonia decussata*, *Phaonia rufitarsis* (1907), *Phaonia tenuirostris* (1907), and *Phaonia halterata* (1893), as well as *Phaonia disjuncta*, *Phaonia hirtirostris*, and *Phaonia tenebriona*.  \n\nNotable species descriptions by STEIN include *Lispe bivittata* (1909, also known as 黑尾缘花蝇), *Lasiopelta longicornis* (1915 and 1928), *Myospila laevis* (1900) and *Myospila tenax* (1918), *Paraprosalpia pilitarsis* (1900), *Coenosia attenuata*, *Coenosia strigipes*, and *Coenosia dilatitarsis* (1907). They also described *Leucophora dorsalis* (1916), *Brontaea ascendens* (1915), *Brontaea distincta* (1909), and the subspecies *Brontaea tonitrui variegata*. In the genus *Helina*, STEIN documented *Helina lateralis* (1904), *Helina coronata* (1915), and *Helina deleta* (1914, under *Mydaea*), as well as *Helina parcepilosa* (1907).  \n\nSTEIN’s work in 1907 was particularly prolific, with descriptions of *Musca crassirostris* (1903), *Musca inferior* (毛瓣家蝇, 1895), *Pegohylemyia depressa* (扁狭泉种蝇, 1916), *Pegohylemyia profuga* (1916), *Pegomya prominens* (1907), *Pegomya aniseta* (1907), and *Ophyra spinigera* (1910) and *Ophyra simplex* (1915). They also described *Emmesomyia ovata* and *Emmesomyia dorsalis*, *Graphomya rufitibia* (1918), *Lasiomma curtigena*, and *Caricea boops* (1918) in India. In 1918, they documented *Anthomyia plumiseta* and *Caricea vernalis* (1907).  \n\nSTEIN’s publications appeared in journals such as *Mitt. Zool. Mus. Berlin*, *Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica*, and the *Academy of Sciences of Petersburg journal*. Their work in 1915 included a species described in Taiwan, and they were a co-author in the classification of *Dasyphora* in 1907.

It is characterized by a slender rostrum, a morphological feature that distinguishes it from other members of the genus. The species also exhibits a non-forked terminal segment of the lateral tail plate, a key taxonomic trait noted in its classification. Delia gracilis has a body length of approximately 7.5 mm, placing it within the typical size range for flies in this genus. Geographically, it is known to inhabit Qinghai, China, specifically in the regions of Huangyuan and Bulhanbuda Mountain. These habitats likely reflect its ecological preferences, though further details on its behavior or life cycle are not provided in the descriptions. The combination of its slender rostrum, non-forked tail plate structure, and specific geographic distribution in Qinghai underscores its unique identification within the *Delia* genus. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, allowing for a unified summary that integrates all details.\",4\n1106,ENGYNEURA SETIGERA,\"Type species of the genus Engyneura, described by Stein in 1907\",4\n1241,扁狭泉种蝇,\"\n\n**扁狭泉种蝇** (Pegohylemyia depressa) is a species of fly within the genus *Pegohylemyia*, first described by Stein in 1907. It is characterized by a body length ranging from 4.5 to 6 mm, with a distinct morphological feature being a short and blunt anal plate terminal process, which differentiates it from the closely related *尖扁泉种蝇*. Additionally, *扁狭泉种蝇* lacks small projections on the lateral lobes of the anal plate, a trait that further distinguishes it from other species in the group. The type locality for this species is Qinghai, China, where it was originally identified. While one source notes its distribution as extending to Japan, Europe, and North America, another description emphasizes its primary association with Qinghai. This discrepancy may reflect regional records or taxonomic updates, but the species is definitively documented in Qinghai as its origin and core habitat. *扁狭泉种蝇* is part of the broader *Pegohylemyia* genus, which includes other species with similar ecological or morphological traits. Its classification and distinguishing features are critical for accurate identification within the group, particularly in differentiating it from *尖扁泉种蝇*. The species’ presence in multiple continents suggests a potential for wider dispersal, though further research may clarify its full geographic range. Morphologically, the combination of a short, blunt anal plate and the absence of lateral lobe projections provides a reliable diagnostic marker for entomologists. As a member of the *Pegohylemyia* genus, it contributes to the study of dipteran biodiversity and ecological adaptations in its habitats.\",4\n1250,三齿泉种蝇,,4\n1575,毛胫厕蝇,\"毛胫厕蝇 (Fannia ciliata Stein, 1895) is a species of fly described by Stein in 1895.

This variation may arise from differing references to either the initial description or a subsequent revision of the species by Stein. Regardless of the specific year, Stein's work remains foundational in the classification of *Lasiopelta longicornis*, contributing to the understanding of its taxonomy and ecological characteristics. The species is notable for its elongated antennae, a feature reflected in its scientific name, which combines the genus *Lasiopelta* with the species epithet *longicornis*, meaning \"\"long-horned\"\" in Latin.
