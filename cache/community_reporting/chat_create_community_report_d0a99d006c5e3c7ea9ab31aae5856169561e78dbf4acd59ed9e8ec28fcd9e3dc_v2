Members of this genus are notable for their elongated third antennal segments, which reach or nearly reach the mouth margin, a feature emphasized in multiple descriptions. Their eye structures are also distinctive, narrowing downward with the lower half often exhibiting a concave shape. This eye morphology, combined with the absence of fronto-orbital bristles (a key diagnostic trait), helps distinguish *Pygophora* from other genera in the family. In males, an additional feature is the presence of a terminal ventral process on the tibia, though this is not universally observed across all species. The descriptions collectively confirm that *Pygophora* is defined by both shared and sex-specific characteristics, with the elongated antennae and specialized eye structures being consistent across the genus. These traits align with its placement in the Coenosiini tribe, a group within the Muscidae family known for diverse morphological adaptations. The synthesis of the provided data resolves no contradictions, as all descriptions are complementary, and the summary integrates the taxonomic context (family and tribe) with the morphological details to provide a cohesive overview of *Pygophora*.\",7\n2912,PYGOPHORA IMMACULIPENNIS,\"Pygophora immaculipennis is a species of fly described by Frey in 1917, with unspotted wings and specific abdominal markings.
