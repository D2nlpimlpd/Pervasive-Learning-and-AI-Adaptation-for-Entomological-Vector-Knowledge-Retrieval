It is distinguished by specific morphological features of the anal lobe and ovipositor, which serve as key diagnostic traits for its identification and taxonomic placement. The tribe encompasses several genera, including *Blaesoxipha*, *Agriella*, *Servaisia*, and *Tephromyia*, each contributing to its taxonomic diversity. These genera are grouped under PROTODEXIINI due to shared characteristics, particularly in reproductive structures, aligning with the tribe’s defining traits. As part of the Sarcophaginae subfamily, PROTODEXIINI is nested within the broader family Sarcophagidae, which includes flesh flies. The establishment of this tribe by Townsend reflects early 20th-century efforts to systematize sarcophagine flies based on anatomical and ecological criteria. While the tribe’s primary classification hinges on the anal lobe and ovipositor morphology, its inclusion of the listed genera underscores its role in the evolutionary and ecological framework of the subfamily. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both emphasize the tribe’s taxonomic origin, subfamily affiliation, and morphological distinctiveness.

The tribe is characterized by specific features such as elongated antennae, distinct body structures, and habitat preferences, which Townsend meticulously outlined in his original description. His establishment of the Protodexiini tribe in that year remains a key reference in subsequent research on the group, highlighting its evolutionary and systematic importance. Both the description and establishment of the tribe are attributed to Townsend in 1912, reflecting his role in defining and introducing this classification to the scientific community.
