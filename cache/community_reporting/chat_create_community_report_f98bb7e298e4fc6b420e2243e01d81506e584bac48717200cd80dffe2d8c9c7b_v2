The nation's diverse ecosystems, spanning deserts, forests, mountains, and coastal regions, support a wide range of flora and fauna, many of which are native to the region. However, Iran also serves as a foreign country in the distribution of certain species, likely due to its geographical position as a crossroads between different biogeographical zones. This dual role highlights Iran's ecological importance in facilitating the spread of species across neighboring regions, such as Central Asia, the Middle East, and the Caspian Sea area. The country's unique topography and climate contribute to its status as both a habitat and a transit point for biodiversity, underscoring its relevance in regional conservation and ecological studies.\",1\n4731,1276亚非折麻蝇,Blaesoxipha rufipes is a fly species whose larvae parasitize grasshoppers,42\n4725,沙特阿拉伯,Saudi Arabia is a country with documented occurrence of the species,1\n4726,也门,Yemen is a country where the insect species are found,1\n4727,约旦,Jordan is a country with reported distribution of the species,1\n4728,叙利亚,Syria is a country where the species occur,1\n3088,加那利群岛,\"\n\nThe **Canary Islands** (Spanish: *Islas Canarias*), also known as **加那利群岛** in Chinese, are a Spanish autonomous community and archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 100 kilometers west of Morocco and 1,250 kilometers south of Spain’s mainland. Politically, they are part of the European Union, though geographically they lie off the northwest coast of Africa. The islands are renowned for their unique biodiversity, serving as a critical region for the occurrence and distribution of various species. Their isolation and diverse ecosystems, shaped by volcanic activity and varying microclimates, have fostered endemic flora and fauna found nowhere else in the world. The term \"\"foreign archipelago\"\" in the second description may refer to the islands’ distinct ecological and geographical separation from the European mainland, despite their political ties to Spain. As a hub for species that span both European and North African biomes, the Canary Islands play a pivotal role in conservation and ecological studies, highlighting their dual significance as a European territory and a biologically isolated Atlantic archipelago.\",1\n4729,热带非洲,Tropical Africa is a geographic area with documented distribution of the species,1\n4732,荒地蚱蜢ACRIDA OXYCEPHALA PALL.,,1\n4733,绿纹蝗AIOLOPUS THALASSINUS F.,,1\n4734,ANACRIDUM AEGYPTIUML.,,1\n4735,A.
