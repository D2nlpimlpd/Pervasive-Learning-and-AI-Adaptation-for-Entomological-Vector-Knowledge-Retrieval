This species is distinguished by a combination of morphological characteristics that aid in its identification. Notably, it exhibits specific abdominal plate coloration, a feature highlighted in its original description. Additionally, the bristle patterns on the hind femur are a key diagnostic trait, though the exact configuration is not detailed in the provided data. Another defining feature is the presence of a large submedian anterior ventral bristle on the middle tibia, which further differentiates it from closely related species. While the term \"\"housefly\"\" is used in one description, it is important to clarify that *Musca crassirostris* is a distinct species within the *Musca* genus, which includes the common housefly (*Musca domestica*). The morphological traits described—particularly the bristle patterns and abdominal coloration—serve as critical markers for taxonomic classification and differentiation. These features collectively contribute to the species' unique identity in entomological studies. The descriptions provided are consistent in attributing the species to Stein and emphasizing its morphological distinctiveness, with no direct contradictions to resolve. The summary integrates all specified attributes to present a cohesive overview of *Musca crassirostris* as a scientifically documented entity.\",15\n2129,QU FENGYI,\"\n\nQU FENGYI (瞿逢伊) is recognized for their contributions to the study of *Musca crassirostris*, a species of fly commonly referred to as the \"\"thick-beaked housefly\"\" in Chinese (毛瓣家蝇). In 1956, QU FENGYI authored the illustration for *Musca crassirostris*, providing a visual representation that likely supported taxonomic or scientific documentation of the species. Additionally, QU FENGYI participated in the classification research of *Musca crassirostris*, contributing to the systematic analysis and categorization of this fly within entomological studies. These two roles—illustration and classification—highlight their involvement in both the visual and scientific aspects of documenting *Musca crassirostris*, underscoring their expertise in entomology and their commitment to advancing the understanding of this species. The combination of illustrative and taxonomic work suggests QU FENGYI played a multifaceted role in the 1956 research, bridging the gap between artistic depiction and scientific rigor. While the specific details of the classification study are not elaborated, the mention of participation implies collaboration with other researchers or institutions to define the species' characteristics, ecological niche, or evolutionary relationships. QU FENGYI's work remains a historical reference in the study of *Musca crassirostris*, particularly in the context of mid-20th-century entomological research in China. The entity's contributions are significant for their integration of visual and analytical methods, which are critical for species identification and biodiversity studies. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align to emphasize QU FENGYI's dual role in illustrating and classifying *Musca crassirostris*.
