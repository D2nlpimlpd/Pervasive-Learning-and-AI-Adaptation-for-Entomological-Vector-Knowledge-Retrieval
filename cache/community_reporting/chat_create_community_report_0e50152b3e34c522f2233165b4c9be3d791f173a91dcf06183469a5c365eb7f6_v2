This species is characterized by its distinct abdominal markings, which serve as a key morphological feature for identification. *Lispe alpinicola* is geographically restricted to the Tibetan region, where it inhabits alpine environments, likely adapted to the high-altitude conditions typical of this area. As part of the *Lispe* genus, it shares taxonomic traits with other members of the family Muscidae, though its specific adaptations and ecological role in Tibet remain subjects of further study. The combination of its unique physical attributes and localized distribution highlights its significance in regional biodiversity research.\",5\n913,PHORBIA SUBSYMMETRICA,Species described by Fan in 1982 in Insect Research Collection,4\n974,肖帚腹地种蝇,\"肖帚腹地种蝇Delia penicillella Fan, 1984 is a species of fly described in 昆虫学研究集刊.

The journal has documented multiple species, including *Phorbia subsymmetrica* (1982), *Isomyia xishuangensis*, *Isomyia pentochaeta*, and *Isomyia furcicula* (Fang et Fan, 1986), as well as *Eutrichota pilimana pilimarginata* and *Eutrichota nigriscens*. It also features the description of *Delia subnigribasis* by Fan and Wang in 1982, alongside *Delia floricola* and *宽角阳蝇* (Chiastocheta latispinigera). Additionally, the species *Phorbia musca* and *匙突欧麻蝇* have been referenced or described in its pages. \n\nThe journal’s second volume (pages 245–246, with figures 1–6) includes detailed research on fly species, though the specific taxa covered in this section are not explicitly named in the provided data. Notably, the 1982 and 1986 publications highlight collaborative and individual contributions from entomologists such as Fang, Fan, and Wang, underscoring the journal’s role in advancing taxonomic studies of flies in China. While some entries mention species in both Chinese and Latin nomenclature (e.g., *宽角阳蝇* as Chiastocheta latispinigera), the journal consistently emphasizes its focus on entomological taxonomy and biodiversity. \n\nBy compiling descriptions of species like *戟斗细麻蝇* and *匙突欧麻蝇*, **昆虫学研究集刊** reflects a commitment to documenting both regionally significant and globally relevant fly taxa. Its contributions to the field include not only formal species descriptions but also references to existing research, as seen with *宽角阳蝇*. The journal’s multilingual approach (Chinese and Latin) and its publication of detailed morphological figures (e.g., in the second volume) further support its utility for international and domestic entomological scholarship. Overall, **昆虫学研究集刊** stands as a vital resource for studies on fly taxonomy, with a documented history of publishing work from the 1980s onward.\",31\n920,SICHUAN (E'MEI MOUNTAIN),\"Region in Sichuan, China, where Phorbia subsymmetrica and Phorbia omeishanensis are distributed.\",2\n916,PHORBIA OMEISHANENSIS,Species referenced in Insect Research Collection with distribution in Tibet,5\n933,PHORBIAS ASYMMETRICA,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4974,LISPE ALPINICOLA,FAN,\"\n\nLISPE ALPINICOLA is a species that was co-described by Fan, who is one of the authors of its taxonomic description.
