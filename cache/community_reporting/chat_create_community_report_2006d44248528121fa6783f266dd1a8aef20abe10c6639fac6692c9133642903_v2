It is known to carry pathogens from feces. The species is also referred to as 肖腐蝇 in the text. Its distribution includes specific regions in China such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, and Xinjiang.\",19\n1720,MUSCINA PASCUROUM,\"Muscina pascuroum is a species within the subgenus Pararicia of the genus Muscina, described by Meigen in 1826. It has distinct features like a greyish powder on the thoracic shield and specific bristle patterns.>\",2\n1716,MUSCINA,\"\n\n**Muscina** is a genus of flies belonging to the subfamily Reinwardtiinae, characterized by a medium to large body size, a black thorax with gray powder, and distinct morphological traits such as a long plumose arista and two rows of notopleural bristles. The type species of the genus is *Muscina stabulans*, which serves as the foundational reference for its classification. Primarily distributed across the Palaearctic region, some species within the genus exhibit a more global range. The genus encompasses subgenera like *Pararicia* and includes notable species such as *Muscina pascuroum* and *Muscina assimilis*. \n\nLarvae of *Muscina* are predatory, feeding on other Diptera larvae, and are known to transmit intestinal diseases, highlighting their ecological and medical significance. Adult *Muscina* flies demonstrate adaptability to seasonal changes, as evidenced by their ability to overwinter in regions like Shanghai, a trait that may contribute to their persistence in temperate climates. The inclusion of *M. assimilis* in the second description expands the known species diversity of the genus, though specific details about its morphology or behavior are not provided. Overall, *Muscina* is a taxonomically and ecologically diverse group within the fly family, with roles as both predators and potential disease vectors.\",21\n1726,NORTHERN AFRICA,\"\n\nNorthern Africa is a region in the northern part of the African continent that serves as a habitat for several insect species. It is explicitly noted as a distribution area for *Parasarcophaga emdeni*, a species of fly, with two descriptions confirming its presence there. Additionally, the region is home to *Muscina* species, a genus of flies commonly associated with decomposing organic matter. *Exorista fasciata*, another fly species, is also reported to occur in Northern Africa, though the phrasing \"\"foreign\"\" and \"\"international region\"\" in some descriptions may reflect the perspective of external researchers rather than inherent regional characteristics. Furthermore, Northern Africa is identified as a location where *Senotainia (Sphixapata) sibirica* and other unspecified species are found, suggesting a broader biodiversity of flies or related arthropods in the area. The repeated emphasis on Northern Africa as a distribution site for these species highlights its ecological role in supporting diverse insect populations, potentially influenced by its climate, geography, and ecosystems. While the descriptions do not provide specific details about the interactions or habitats of these species, they collectively underscore Northern Africa as a region of interest for entomological studies, particularly for understanding the range and distribution of dipteran (true fly) species. The use of terms like \"\"foreign\"\" or \"\"international\"\" in some descriptions may indicate that these species are studied or referenced in global scientific contexts, but the core information aligns in identifying Northern Africa as a shared habitat for the listed organisms. This summary consolidates all provided data points into a unified account of the region's biological significance.\",5\n1721,ROBINEAU-DESVIOY,\"\n\n**Robineau-Desvoidy** was a notable French entomologist and taxonomist active in the 19th century. He is best known for his contributions to the classification of dipteran insects (flies). In 1830, Robineau-Desvoidy described the species *Gonia picea*, a significant taxonomic act that added to the understanding of insect biodiversity during that period. The same year, he also established the genus *Muscina*, which is part of the family Muscidae, further demonstrating his expertise in systematizing fly taxonomy. These two achievements—describing *Gonia picea* and defining the genus *Muscina*—highlight his role in advancing entomological science through detailed morphological analysis and nomenclatural work. His efforts in 1830 remain foundational in the study of these insect groups, with both the species and genus names still recognized in modern taxonomic literature. Robineau-Desvoidy’s work reflects the broader scientific endeavors of the 19th century to catalog and categorize the natural world, particularly in the field of arthropod classification.\",2\n1737,PATHOGEN TRANSMISSION,,1\n1738,JANUARY-MARCH,,1\n1739,MAY-JUNE-OCTOBER,,1\n5609,GONIA PICEA,\"Gonia picea is a species of fly described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830, found in domestic regions including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Beijing, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Tibet, as well as internationally in Europe\",11\n1139,OCEANIA,\"\n\nOceania is a biogeographic region characterized by the distribution of several insect species and genera.

Additionally, Oceania hosts other *Fucellia* species, though specific names beyond *Fucellia sp. 1431* are not detailed in the provided data. The region is also home to the genus *Sarcosolomonia*, which includes species within this taxonomic group, though no specific species names are listed. Furthermore, Oceania supports the presence of three distinct species: *Muscina assimilis*, *Synthesiomyia nudiseta*, and *Passeromyia heterochaeta*, all of which are likely dipteran flies given their genus classifications. The genus *Sarcorohdendorfia* is also reported to be distributed in Oceania, though its ecological or taxonomic details are not elaborated. Collectively, these findings highlight Oceania’s role as a significant region for the biodiversity of tachinid and muscid flies, as well as other related genera. The data underscores the region’s ecological importance in supporting a range of parasitic and potentially detritivorous or predatory insect species, though further taxonomic or ecological context for the mentioned genera and species would enhance understanding.
