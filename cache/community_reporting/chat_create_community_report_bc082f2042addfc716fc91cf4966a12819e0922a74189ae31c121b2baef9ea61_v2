It is characterized by distinct morphological traits, including specific bristle lengths and a body size ranging from 9 to 12 millimeters. The species is geographically distributed across several regions in Asia, with confirmed records in the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces of China, as well as in Nepal and India. While the first description notes its presence in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Nepal, the second expands the range to include India, suggesting a broader distribution within the Himalayan and southern Chinese regions. As a member of the *Polietes* genus, it likely shares ecological or taxonomic traits with related species, though its unique physical attributes and geographic range distinguish it. The inclusion of both scientific and common terminology (e.g., \"\"species of Polietes\"\" and \"\"species of fly\"\") in the descriptions indicates that *Polietes orientalis* is a taxonomic entity within the fly order Diptera. No contradictions in the data are present, as the additional mention of India in the second description complements the first without conflict. The summary consolidates all provided details into a cohesive account of the species' classification, morphology, and distribution.\",6\n402,INDIA,\"\n\nIndia, a South Asian country, is a significant region for the distribution of numerous fly species across diverse genera and ecological zones. It is home to *Robineauella (D.) walayari* in the Madras Province forests and serves as the type locality for 612黄髭芒蝇 (Coimbatore) and 1397卡西亚麻蝇. The country hosts multiple *Dichaetomyia* species, including *LUTEIVENTRIS*, *APICALIS*, *SETIFEMUR*, and *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, with some distributed internationally. Notable species documented in India include *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina cuprina*, *Sarcophaga haematodes*, *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Argyrophylax phoeda*, *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*, *Caiusa testacea*, *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, *Musca larvipara*, *Musca crassirostris*, *Haematobia titillans*, *Haematobia minuta*, *Halydaia* and *Linnaemya* species, *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, *Isomyia electa*, *Isomyia viridaurea*, *Isomyia nebulosa*, *Leucomyia cinerea* (eastern region), *Limnophora albitarsis*, *Lispe sinica*, *Metalliopsis setosa*, *Borbororhinia bivittata*, *Paradichosia scutellata* (type locality: Darjeeling), *Pegomya bicolor*, *Pegomya quadrivittata*, *Polietes orientalis* (northern regions), *Sturmiopsis inferens*, *Tainanina pilisquama*, *Neomyia* species, *Stomoxys indicus* (type locality), *Subhylemyia longula*, *Ophyra chalcogaster*, *Hydrotaea affinis* (southern region), *Lixophaga parva*, *Muscina assimilis*, *Synthesiomyia nudiseta*, *613点芒蝇*, *紫翠蝇*, *绿翠蝇*, *东方粪泉蝇*, *长板粪泉蝇* (Assam), *Adia* genus (Assam, Khasi, and Garo Hills), *Scathophaga mellipes*, *Limnophora prominens*, *Limnophora exigua*, *Limnophora fallax fallax*, *Brontaea lasiopa* (type locality), *Chlororhinia exempta* (Assam), *Caricea boops*, *Cosmina bicolor*, *Cosmina limbipennis*, *Atherigona kappa*, *Atherigona tricolorifolia* (potential geographic subspecies), *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Atherigona biseta*, *Bengalia* species, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Borbororhina bivittata*, *Rhyncomya flavibasis*, *Drino inconspicua*, *Calythea setifrons*, *Muscidae* subfamilies, and *Sarcosolomonia crinita*. Additionally, India is a foreign distribution location for *Sarcophaga misera*, *Sarcophaga sericea*, *Sarcophaga aegyptica*, and *Stomorhina* genus species. The country's ecological diversity supports these flies, with specimens collected from regions like Darjeeling, Assam, Kashmir, and the southern areas. India's role as a type locality for several species, such as *Paradichosia scutellata* (Darjeeling) and *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* (Kashmir), underscores its importance in entomological taxonomy. The presence of both native and internationally distributed species highlights India's integration into global fly biodiversity patterns. Key genera like *Musca*, *Limnophora*, and *Dichaetomyia* are particularly well-represented, with some species (e.g., *Polietes orientalis*) noted in northern regions. The Indian greenbottle fly and the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly are also documented, alongside ecological records for *Caiusa testacea*. Overall, India's varied habitats and geographic regions contribute to its status as a critical area for studying fly species distribution and taxonomy.\",90\n4010,SPOLETTA ZEYLANICA,A journal where Senior-White described Caiusa testacea in 1923,4\n5303,1397卡西亚麻蝇,\"A species of fly (Parasarcophaga (Curranea) khasiensis) described by Senior-White in 1924, found in China and Europe\",7\n5304,REC.IND.MUS.,Journal where the 1397卡西亚麻蝇 species was published,1\n1951,NIHON,\"\n\n**NIHON**, the Japanese name for Japan, is associated with two distinct ecological contexts in the provided data. First, it is noted as a **foreign distribution location** for the *Red-headed Calliphora* (*Calliphora vicina*), a species of blowfly. Within Japan, the regions of **Hokkaido** and **Honshu** are specifically highlighted as **common habitats for adult Red-headed Calliphora**, indicating their presence in these areas despite being non-native. This suggests that while the species may not originate from Japan, it has established populations in these regions, likely due to environmental suitability or human-mediated introduction.  \n\nSeparately, **Nepal** is identified as the **type locality** for *Polietes orientalis*, a species of hoverfly. A type locality refers to the geographic location where a species is first discovered and described, underscoring Nepal’s significance in the taxonomic history of this insect. However, this information is unrelated to NIHON (Japan) and instead pertains to a different country and species.  \n\nThe two descriptions do not present direct contradictions but address distinct species and their relationships to separate geographic regions. The Red-headed Calliphora’s presence in Japan emphasizes its adaptability to non-native environments, while the mention of Nepal as the type locality for *Polietes orientalis* highlights the role of specific regions in biological classification. Together, these details illustrate the diverse ecological and taxonomic roles of different locations in entomology, though they pertain to separate entities (Japan and Nepal) and species.  \n\nIn summary, NIHON (Japan) serves as a habitat for the non-native *Red-headed Calliphora*, particularly in Hokkaido and Honshu, whereas Nepal is the origin point for the hoverfly *Polietes orientalis*. Both regions contribute to the understanding of insect distribution and taxonomy, albeit in different capacities and for different species.
