It serves as a type locality for several species, including *Phaonia subconsobrina*, *Phaonia jilinensis*, and the subspecies *Paraprosalpia conifrons changbaiensis*, as well as the genera *Chiastocheta* (for *C. latispinigera* and *C. curvibasis*) and *Alliopsis*. The mountain is also associated with the distribution of diverse fly species, such as *Phaonia incana*, *Phaonia changbaishanensis*, *Mydaea setifemur*, *Fannia kowarzi*, *Fannia bisetosa*, *Coelomyia subpellucens*, *Coelomyia mollissima*, *Pseudonupedia intersecta*, *Helina parcepilosa*, *Helina obscurata*, *Eutrichota labradorensis*, *Pegomya nigra*, and *Alloeostylus* species. Additionally, it is linked to *Spilogona changbaishanensis*, though one description erroneously cites Liaoning Province as its location; the majority of references confirm Jilin as the correct province. The mountain further appears in the distribution records of *Hydrophoria lancifer*. These associations highlight Changbai Mountain as a critical region for studying biodiversity, particularly within the Diptera order, and underscore its role in the taxonomy and ecology of various fly species. Its status as a type locality for multiple genera and subspecies emphasizes its importance in scientific classification, while the presence of regionally endemic species like *Phaonia changbaishanensis* and *Paraprosalpia conifrons changbaiensis* suggests unique environmental conditions supporting specialized fauna. Despite minor inconsistencies in some descriptions (e.g., the Liaoning reference), the overwhelming consensus places Changbai Mountain in Jilin Province, China, as a hub for entomological research and a key site for understanding species distribution patterns in the region.\",16\n1163,CHIASTOCHETA LATISPINIGERA,,8\n897,中国经济昆虫志,\"\n\n**\"\"中国经济昆虫志\"\"** is a comprehensive Chinese entomology journal dedicated to documenting insect species with economic significance, particularly those relevant to agriculture, forestry, and biodiversity in China. The publication serves as a critical resource for entomologists, ecologists, and researchers by providing detailed taxonomic descriptions, ecological insights, and distribution data for various insect taxa. It has historically contributed to the scientific understanding of both pest and beneficial species, supporting efforts in pest management, conservation, and ecological studies.  \n\nKey species documented in the journal include **Eutrichota gigas**, a notable example of the diverse insect fauna cataloged within its pages. Additionally, the journal recorded **Phorbia securis xibeina** in 1988, highlighting its role in tracking regional insect populations and their taxonomic classifications over time. Another documented species is **Chiastocheta curvibasis**, further underscoring the journal’s focus on a wide range of insect groups, including flies and other arthropods. These entries reflect the journal’s commitment to systematic entomology and its utility in advancing knowledge of China’s insect biodiversity.  \n\nThe journal’s structure and content emphasize rigorous scientific methodology, with contributions from Chinese researchers and international collaborators. It is part of a broader effort to compile and disseminate information on economically important insects, aiding in the development of sustainable practices for agriculture and natural resource management. By integrating field observations, laboratory studies, and historical data, **\"\"中国经济昆虫志\"\"** provides a multidimensional perspective on insect ecology and taxonomy.  \n\nWhile the descriptions provided do not indicate direct contradictions, they collectively establish the journal’s role as a authoritative reference for insect species in China. The inclusion of specific examples like *Eutrichota gigas*, *Phorbia securis xibeina* (1988), and *Chiastocheta curvibasis* demonstrates its long-standing contribution to entomological science. The journal’s focus on economic relevance suggests it prioritizes species that impact human activities, though it also supports broader ecological research by documenting rare or understudied taxa.  \n\nIn summary, **\"\"中国经济昆虫志\"\"** is a vital publication in Chinese entomology, combining taxonomic rigor with practical applications. Its documentation of species such as *Eutrichota gigas*, *Phorbia securis xibeina*, and *Chiastocheta curvibasis* exemplifies its role in advancing scientific knowledge and informing environmental and agricultural policies.
