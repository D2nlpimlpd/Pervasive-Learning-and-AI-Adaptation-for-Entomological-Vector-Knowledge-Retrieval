It serves as a key distribution area for several insect species, highlighting its biodiversity and ecological importance. Specifically, DEQIN is noted as the **mode locality** (the type locality where a species is first described) for the species *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, a taxonomic designation that underscores its role in entomological research. The county is also associated with the presence of *Mesembrina mystacea*, a species documented within its territory, and *Drymeia* species, which are found in the area as part of their broader distribution range. Additionally, DEQIN is linked to *Miltogramma bimaculatum*, further emphasizing its role as a habitat for diverse insect life. \n\nOne of the most specific ecological details about DEQIN is its high-altitude site at **3700 meters elevation**, where the species *Metopia yunnanica* has been recorded. This elevation data provides critical context for understanding the environmental conditions that support the species’ survival. While the descriptions do not specify whether the other species (*Mesembrina mystacea*, *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, *Drymeia*, and *Miltogramma bimaculatum*) are found at similar altitudes, they collectively establish DEQIN as a region of interest for studying insect biodiversity in Yunnan. \n\nThe repeated mention of DEQIN in relation to multiple species across different genera suggests it is a focal point for entomological studies in the province. Its inclusion as a distribution site for *Drymeia* species and the mode locality for *Polleniopsis deqingensis* indicates that the area may harbor unique microhabitats or ecological niches conducive to specialized insect populations. The presence of *Metopia yunnanica* at 3700 meters further highlights the county’s varied topography, which likely supports a range of ecosystems from lower to higher elevations. \n\nIn summary, DEQIN is a county in Yunnan, China, distinguished by its role as a habitat for several insect species, including *Mesembrina mystacea*, *Drymeia* species, *Miltogramma bimaculatum*, and *Metopia yunnanica* (specifically at 3700 meters elevation). It is also the type locality for *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, cementing its importance in scientific documentation. The data collectively portray DEQIN as a biologically rich and ecologically diverse region within Yunnan, warranting further study to understand its contributions to regional biodiversity. \n\n(Word count: 200)\",2\n1980,BESCHR. EUROPEAN DIPTERA,Publication (Beschr. europ. Dipt.) referencing Mesembrina mystacea,1\n1592,YIBIN,\"\n\nYIBIN is a city located in Sichuan Province, China. It is notable for its significance in entomological studies, particularly as the type locality for the species *Mesembrina mystacea*. A type locality refers to the geographic location where a species is first discovered and formally described, making YIBIN a key site for the taxonomic classification of this organism. Additionally, YIBIN is home to *Yibin Fannia*, another species found in the region. While the two descriptions highlight different species associated with the city, they collectively underscore YIBIN's role as a biodiversity hotspot or research area for specific taxa. The city’s ecological or geographical features likely contribute to the presence and study of these species, though further details about their habitats or conservation status are not provided in the data. Both *Mesembrina mystacea* and *Yibin Fannia* are linked to YIBIN in scientific literature, with the former being definitively tied to the city as its type locality and the latter being documented as occurring there. This dual association positions YIBIN as an important reference point in the study of these organisms, particularly for researchers examining their distribution, behavior, or evolutionary history. The descriptions do not conflict but instead complement each other by emphasizing the city’s relevance to multiple species. As a result, YIBIN is recognized not only as a regional urban center in Sichuan but also as a site of biological and taxonomic importance.
