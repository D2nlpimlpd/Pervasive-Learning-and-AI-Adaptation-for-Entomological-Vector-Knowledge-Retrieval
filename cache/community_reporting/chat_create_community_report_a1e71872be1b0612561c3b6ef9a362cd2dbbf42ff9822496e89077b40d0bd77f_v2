It hosts a diverse array of flies, including the **Pygophora respondens**, **Dinemomyia nigribasicosta** (specifically in Chiang Mai), **Kanomyia bangkokensis**, and multiple **Musca** species such as *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, and *Musca crassirostris* (with foreign distribution records). The **Dichaetomyia** genus is notably well-represented, with species like *Dichaetomyia luteiventrus*, *Dichaetomyia aureomarginata*, *Dichaetomyia apicalis*, *Dichaetomyia flavocaudata*, *Dichaetomyia pallicornis*, and *Dichaetomyia quadrata* documented internationally in Thailand. Additionally, the **Star Island Greenbottle Fly** and **Indian greenbottle fly** are reported in the country, alongside **Hydrotaea affinis**, **Hypopygiopsis infumata**, **Hypopygiopsis tumrasvini**, **Neomyia ruficornis**, **Haematobia minuta**, **Hemipyrellia liguriens**, **Isomyia cupreoviridis**, **Leucomyia cinerea**, and **Anthomyia illocata**. \n\nThailand also serves as a foreign distribution site for species such as the **hairy-petaled housefly** (毛瓣家蝇) and the **Yunnan and Yiwu flies** (云南亚麻蝇、义乌亚麻蝇), indicating its role in the global range of these insects. The **Stomorhina** genus is present in Thailand, with multiple species recorded there. Furthermore, the **Linnaemya** genus and the **Onesia** genus are associated with Thailand’s biodiversity. Specific species like **1397 Kasia fly** (卡西亚麻蝇) and **1393 Yiwu fly** (义乌亚麻蝇) are noted as part of its foreign distribution records, while **Myospila argentata** and **Lasiopelta** species are also documented. \n\nThe country’s ecological significance is underscored by the presence of 1397 and 1393 species, as well as repeated references to \"\"the species\"\" being distributed or found in Thailand, likely highlighting its role as a hotspot for entomological diversity. These records collectively emphasize Thailand’s importance in the study of fly species, both native and internationally distributed, across various genera and habitats. Its Southeast Asian location and varied ecosystems contribute to the coexistence of such a wide range of taxa, making it a critical area for biodiversity research. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",29\n2869,PYGOPHORA RESPONDENS,\"\n\n**Pygophora respondens** is a species of fly first described by Walker in 1859 and formally documented in the *Zoology* journal of the Linnean Society of London. The species is characterized by a yellow abdomen, a feature highlighted in multiple descriptions, and distinct lateral abdominal spots, as noted in one account. Its antennal segments are also described as yellow, adding to its morphological identification. The bristle patterns on the abdomen, another key diagnostic trait, are mentioned as specific but not further detailed in the provided data.  \n\nGeographically, **Pygophora respondens** is distributed across several regions. It is found in **Xinjiang, China**, as reported in one source, and extends internationally to **Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and other Pacific islands**, according to a broader distribution list. This suggests the species has a range spanning parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia, as well as the Pacific.  \n\nThe species has been illustrated in scientific literature, with a notable depiction by **Snyder in 1965**, which likely aids in its taxonomic identification. While the original description by Walker focused on abdominal features, subsequent references emphasize the combination of coloration (yellow abdomen and antennae) and structural traits (lateral spots, bristle patterns) to distinguish it.  \n\nIn summary, **Pygophora respondens (Walker, 1859)** is a fly species recognized for its yellow abdomen, lateral abdominal spots, and yellow antennal segments, with a specific bristle pattern. It is native to **Xinjiang, China**, and has a wider distribution across **Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and other Pacific islands**. The species was first described by Walker in 1859 and later illustrated by Snyder in 1965, contributing to its taxonomic history. The combination of its distinctive coloration and anatomical features, along with its geographic range, provides a comprehensive profile for identification and ecological study.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",23\n713,WALKER,\"\n\n**Walker** was a prominent 19th-century entomologist and taxonomist known for his extensive contributions to the classification of flies (Diptera). He described numerous species across multiple genera, with his work spanning from 1825 to 1860. In 1825, Walker first documented *Hylemya detracta*, marking an early milestone in his career. By 1849, he had described several species, including *Mikia tepens*, *Halydaia luteicornis*, *Dexia aurinia*, and *Sisyropa prominens*. His 1857 publications were particularly prolific, featuring the description of *Idia bivittata*, *Myospila argentata*, *Borbororhinia bivittata*, *Musca exempta*, and *Cynomya fortis*. \n\nIn 1858, Walker contributed to the taxonomy of blowflies by describing *Chrysomya pinguis* (later reclassified as *Chrysomya (Compsomyia) pinguis*), a species commonly known as the Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly. The same year, he also documented the host species *Leucania separata*. By 1859, Walker’s work expanded to include the establishment of the genus *Neomyia* and the description of its type species *Musca (Neomyia) gavisa*. That year, he also described *Sisyropa prominens*, *Pygophora respondens*, and *Seniorwhitea reciproca*. In 1860, he added *Sarcorohdendorfia inextricata* to the scientific record. \n\nWalker’s 1856 contributions included *Sarcophaga reciproca* (now *Sarcophaga sericea*), *Sarcophaga misera*, and *Anthomyia illocata*. Additionally, he described the genus *Cosmina* and the species *Isomyia delectans* in entomological taxonomy. His work on *Musca conducens* and *Neomyia gavisa* further solidified his role in defining key taxa within the Diptera order. \n\nDespite some inconsistencies in the data (e.g., conflicting years for *Myospila argentata* and *Pygophora respondens*), the majority of sources align on Walker’s primary role as a taxonomist who described these species between 1849 and 1860. His legacy is preserved in the naming of genera and species, reflecting his systematic approach to classifying flies and their ecological relationships. Walker’s descriptions remain foundational in entomology, particularly for the genera *Neomyia*, *Sarcophaga*, and *Chrysomya*, as well as species like *Anthomyia illocata* and *Borbororhinia bivittata*. His work in the mid-19th century advanced the understanding of fly taxonomy, providing a framework for subsequent research in the field. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",33\n2585,MYOSPIRA ARGENTATA,\"\n\n**Myospila argentata** is a species of fly described by Walker in 1857. It is characterized by a combination of distinct morphological features, including a yellow scutellum (a triangular plate on the thorax), abdominal black spots, and specific bristle counts that aid in its taxonomic identification. Additionally, the species exhibits a silvery forehead, a notable trait that contributes to its visual distinction from related flies. Its wing and body structures also display unique features, though the exact details of these are not fully elaborated in the provided descriptions. \n\nGeographically, **Myospila argentata** is distributed across China, Southeast Asia, and other tropical regions, indicating a preference for warm, humid climates. The species is part of the broader group of flies studied in entomology, with its classification and physical attributes aligning with the taxonomic work of Walker, a prominent 19th-century entomologist known for his contributions to dipteran systematics. \n\nThe discrepancy in the entity name—**Myospira argentata** versus **Myospila argentata**—appears to be a typographical error, as the second description references the species without specifying the genus. Given the first description explicitly identifies the genus as *Myospila*, this is likely the correct classification. The summary integrates all provided details, resolving the name inconsistency while preserving the key characteristics and distribution information. \n\nIn total, **Myospila argentata** is a tropical fly species with a yellow scutellum, silvery forehead, abdominal black spots, and specific bristle patterns, first documented by Walker in 1857 and found in regions such as China and Southeast Asia. Its morphological traits and geographic range make it a subject of interest for studies on dipteran biodiversity and taxonomy.

Conservation efforts in the area focus on preserving these natural resources, including the habitats of species like *Pygophora respondens*, which are integral to the islands' ecological balance. The descriptions provided align in identifying the Seychelles as both a geographical entity in the Indian Ocean and a key location for the distribution of this species, with no contradictions to resolve.\",1\n2640,CHRISTMAS ISLAND,\"\n\n**CHRISTMAS ISLAND** is a territory of Australia located in the Indian Ocean, approximately 2,600 kilometers northwest of the Australian mainland. It is renowned for its unique biodiversity, serving as a critical habitat for several endemic and rare species. The island is specifically noted as the distribution range of *Pygophora respondens*, a species of beetle, which highlights its ecological significance in supporting specialized insect life. Additionally, Christmas Island is recognized as a location where *Lasiopelta* species, a genus of ants, are found. These ants are part of the island’s distinct arthropod community, which has evolved in relative isolation due to the island’s remote position. As an Australian external territory, Christmas Island’s conservation efforts and scientific studies often focus on preserving its endemic species and understanding the dynamics of its isolated ecosystems. The combination of its geographical location and status as a protected area contributes to its role as a vital site for biodiversity research in the Indian Ocean region.\",3\n5160,BOETTCHERISCA KARNYI,,11\n868,ANDAMAN ISLANDS,Region where Hylemya detracta is distributed,2\n2635,PROC.

Walker, a notable figure in entomology, formally documented this species during the mid-19th century, contributing to the classification of beetles within the genus *Pygophora*. The species name \"\"respondens\"\" is derived from Latin, likely reflecting a characteristic or behavior observed in the insect, though specific details about its morphology, habitat, or ecological role are not provided in the given data. Walker's work in 1859 established the scientific recognition of *Pygophora respondens*, aligning with his broader contributions to the taxonomy of Coleoptera (beetles). No contradictions exist in the provided descriptions, as both confirm Walker's role in describing the species and the year 1859 as the point of its formal classification.\",56\n4530,MYOSPIRA ARGENTATA,WALKER,\"\n\n**Myospira argentata** is a species of insect first described by the entomologist **Walker** in 1857. The species was originally documented under the genus name *Myospila* in the same year by Walker, who is recognized for his extensive contributions to the taxonomy of Lepidoptera. Over time, the genus has been revised, and the species is now classified under *Myospira*, reflecting updated taxonomic understanding. Walker’s 1857 description marks the formal introduction of *Myospira argentata* into scientific literature, establishing its nomenclature and foundational classification. Both descriptions provided confirm the same author and year of publication, aligning with historical records of Walker’s work during the mid-19th century. The entity names *Myospira argentata* and **Walker** are directly linked in this context, as Walker’s taxonomic efforts are central to the species’ recognition. No contradictions exist in the data regarding the year or authorship, and the summary integrates the information to clarify the taxonomic history and current classification of the species.\",44\n10021,SARCOGAGA MISERA,WALKER,Walker described Sarcophaga misera in 1849,39\n7640,FAT-BODIED GREENBOTTLE FLY,WALKER,Walker described the Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly in 1858,37\n10027,SARCOGAGA SERICEA,WALKER,Walker described Sarcophaga sericea in 1852,37\n3946,MUSCA (NEOMYIA) GAVISA,WALKER,Walker described the type species Musca (Neomyia) gavisa in 1859,35\n7852,MUSCA EXEMPTA,WALKER,Walker described the species Musca exempta in 1857,35\n781,WALKER,ANHOMYIA ILOCATA,Walker described Anthomyia illocata,34\n3624,MUSCA CONDUCENS,WALKER,Walker described the species *Musca conducens*,34\n4608,WALKER,MYOSPILA ARGENTATA,Walker is the author of Myospila argentata,34\n8078,WALKER,\"PROC.LINN, SOC,LOND.\",Walker described the genus Cosmina and species Isomyia delectans in this journal,34\n11582,WALKER,LIST DIPT.
