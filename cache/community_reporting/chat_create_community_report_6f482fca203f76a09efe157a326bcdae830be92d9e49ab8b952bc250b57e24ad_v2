In 1964, the station conducted two significant surveys related to fly species: one focused on *Musca larvipara*, a parasitic fly known for its association with livestock, and another on *Chrysomya megacephala*, a common blowfly species often studied for its role in decomposition and forensic entomology. These studies likely aimed to assess the distribution, behavior, or public health implications of these insects in the region. The station’s work during this period reflects its role in monitoring and controlling vector-borne diseases, as well as contributing to scientific understanding of arthropod populations. While the descriptions do not clarify whether the surveys were part of a broader initiative or separate projects, they collectively highlight the station’s engagement in entomological research during the mid-20th century. The entity remains a key player in local health and disease prevention efforts, though its current activities may extend beyond the specific studies mentioned. The 1964 surveys underscore its historical commitment to addressing both agricultural and medical entomology challenges in Jinzhou.
