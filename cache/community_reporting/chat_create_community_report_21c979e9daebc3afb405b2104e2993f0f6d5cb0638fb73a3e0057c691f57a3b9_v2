It belongs to the subfamily Rhiniinae, as noted in the second description. The genus is characterized by distinct morphological features, including the presence of a single post-pretarsal bristle and specific wing vein patterns, which are critical for its taxonomic identification. Its type species is **Arhynidia aberrans**, though the first description mistakenly attributes the type species to the genus *Rhychomyia*. This discrepancy is resolved by aligning with standard taxonomic conventions, where the type species must belong to the described genus. \n\nGeographically, **ARRHINIDIA** is distributed in **Eastern China**, as indicated in the first description. The genus is part of the broader family of flies, though the exact family is not specified in the provided data. The combination of its unique bristle configuration and wing venation patterns, along with its regional distribution, helps distinguish it from other genera within the Rhiniinae subfamily. \n\nThe two descriptions are largely consistent, with the primary difference being the mention of the type species in the first and the subfamily classification in the second. By integrating these details, the summary clarifies that **ARRHINIDIA** is a taxonomically distinct genus within Rhiniinae, native to Eastern China, and defined by its specialized anatomical traits. This synthesis ensures a coherent and comprehensive overview of the entity. \n\n(Word count: 150)\",5\n4139,CHINESE EAST,\"Eastern China, the distribution area for the genus Arrhinidia.\",1\n4137,DENSKSCHR.AKAD.WISS,A journal where the genus Arrhinidia was published in 1891.,2\n4138,WIEN,\"Vienna, the location of the Austrian Academy of Sciences associated with the journal Denskschr.Akad.Wiss.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n7826,ARRHINIDIA,BRAUER ET BERGENSTAMM,\"\n\nThe genus **Arrhinidia** was first described in 1891 by the entomologists **Brauer and Bergenstamm**, whose collaborative work is also cited in scientific literature as **Brauer et Bergenstamm**.

The entity **Arrhinidia** refers to a taxonomic group within the field of entomology, while **Brauer et Bergenstamm** (or **Brauer and Bergenstamm**) represents the pair of researchers responsible for its formal classification. Their 1891 description established the foundational taxonomic framework for the genus, which remains a key reference in subsequent studies of the group.
