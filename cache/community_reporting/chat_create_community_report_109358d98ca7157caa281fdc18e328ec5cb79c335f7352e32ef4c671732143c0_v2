Established by entomologist **Boris Rohdendorf** in 1937, it is distinguished by specific morphological features of the male genitalia. Key characteristics include membranous processes on the parameres that are nearly equal in length to the base of these structures, as well as lateral parameres that extend forward. Additionally, the subgenus is marked by a small, less exposed epandrium, a component of the male genitalia. These traits collectively define the subgenus and differentiate it from other *Sarcophaga* subgenera. The **type species** of *Bellieriomima* is *Sarcophaga graciliforceps*, described by Thomas in 1949. This species serves as the nomenclatural reference for the subgenus. The descriptions provided align in their focus on male genitalia morphology, with the first offering more detailed anatomical specifics and the second emphasizing the broader taxonomic context. No contradictions exist between the sources, as they complement each other in defining the subgenus. Bellieriomima’s classification and diagnostic features are critical for identifying species within this group, particularly in taxonomic studies of Sarcophagidae. Its name reflects the unique structural adaptations observed in the male reproductive system, which are central to its taxonomic distinction. The subgenus remains a subject of interest in entomological research due to its specialized morphology and evolutionary significance within the *Sarcophaga* genus.\",4\n5048,SARCOPHAGA GRACILIFORCEPS,,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9431,BELLIERIOMIMA,PIERRETIA,Bellieriomima is a subgenus under the Pierretia genus,13\n9438,BELLIERIOMIMA,SARCOPHAGA GRACILIFORCEPS,Sarcophaga graciliforceps is the type species of Bellieriomima,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
