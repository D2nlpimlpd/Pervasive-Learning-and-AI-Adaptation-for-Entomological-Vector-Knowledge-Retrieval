It is documented as a habitat for **1396犁头亚麻蝇** (a species of fly, likely *Ophiomyia* or a related genus), as well as **Haematobia titillans** (horn fly) and **Haematobia minuta** (a smaller blood-feeding fly). Additionally, Spain serves as the **type locality** for **Miltogramma iberium**, a species within the genus *Miltogramma*, and is explicitly noted as an international distribution site for this species. The country is also associated with the presence of **Musca larvipara** (a blow fly species), the **Helicophagella genus** (a group of flies), and **Wohlfahrtia bella** (a flesh fly).  \n\nSpain is further recognized as a **foreign location** for the distribution of **Stomorhina lunata** (a species of tachinid fly) and **双毛碧蝇** (a Chinese name for a species, likely *Chrysomya* or a related hoverfly/flower fly). These references highlight Spain’s role as a non-native or secondary distribution site in some contexts, though it remains a primary location for others. For example, while the country is described as a \"\"foreign country\"\" in relation to certain species, it is also explicitly identified as the **type locality** for *Miltogramma iberium*, underscoring its importance in taxonomic studies.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Spain’s ecological and geographical relevance to entomological research, particularly for flies and their subspecies. The repeated mention of Spain as a distribution site across diverse taxa (e.g., blood-feeding flies, blow flies, tachinids) suggests it hosts a range of insect populations, possibly due to its varied climates and ecosystems. However, the term \"\"foreign country\"\" in some entries may reflect the perspective of the reporting sources, which could be from outside Europe or the Iberian Peninsula, rather than an inherent contradiction.  \n\nIn summary, Spain is a key location in the distribution of several insect species, including **1396犁头亚麻蝇**, **Haematobia titillans**, **Haematobia minuta**, **Miltogramma iberium** (with Spain as its type locality), **Musca larvipara**, **Helicophagella genus**, **Wohlfahrtia bella**, **Stomorhina lunata**, and **双毛碧蝇**. Its role as both a primary and foreign distribution site reflects its position within broader biogeographical studies, while the inclusion of the type locality for *Miltogramma iberium* highlights its contribution to scientific classification. The country’s diverse habitats and climatic conditions likely support these species, making it a focal point for entomological research in Europe.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",5\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n8476,VILLENUEVE,MILTOGRAMMA (CYLINDROTHECUM) IBERIUM,Villeneuve is the describer of the species Miltogramma (Cylindrothecum) iberium,41\n8480,SPAIN,MILTOGRAMMA (CYLINDROTHECUM) IBERIUM,Spain is the type locality for Miltogramma (Cylindrothecum) iberium,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
