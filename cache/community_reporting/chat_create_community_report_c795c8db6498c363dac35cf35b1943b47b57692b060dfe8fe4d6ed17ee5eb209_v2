Their career spans multiple decades, beginning with a 1959 study on larval development in human feces and continuing through the 1990s, during which they made significant contributions to the taxonomy of Diptera. FAN established the **Blaesoxiphini tribe** in 1965 and co-founded the subgenus **Apicamplexa** with Qian. They also described the genus **Sinochirosia** in 1988 and **Burmanomyia** in 1964. Collaborations with Fang and Wang further enriched their work, including co-describing *Isomyia latimarginata*, *Isomyia lingulata*, *Isomyia furcicula* (1986), and *Lispe lanceoseta* (1981).  \n\nFAN’s taxonomic contributions include over 50 species and subspecies. Early works from 1965 feature *Mesembrina montana asternopleuralis*, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) shenyangensis*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) hainanensis*, *Musca pilifacies*, *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Pegomya japonica mokanensis*, *Pegomya chinensis*, *Metopia amamiensis*, *Musca tibetana*, *Pollenia rudis*, *Protocalliphora lii*, *Craspedochoeta pullulula*, and *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia*. In 1964, they described *Heteronychia quoi*, and in 1965, the Chinese flat-headed fly *Catapicephala sinica*. The 1970s saw the description of *Coelomyia ctenophora* in 1974, while the 1980s marked a period of expanded focus, including *Delia tenuipensis*, *Delia quadrilateralis* (1982), *Delia latissima*, *Delia penicillella*, and *Delia sphaerobasis* (1984). They also co-authored descriptions of *Hydrophoria pronata* (with Qian), *Paradelia nototrigona*, *Lasiomma graciliapicum*, and *Lasiomma divergens* (1982).  \n\nFAN’s research on **Drymeia** species includes *Drymeia cinerascens*, *Drymeia pectinitibia*, *Drymeia oculipilosa*, *Drymeia brevifacies*, and *Drymeia yadongensis*, alongside *Dexopollenia uniseta* and *Hylemya bruneipalpis* (1982). In the 1980s and 1990s, they described *Pegohylemyia mediospicula* (拟山字泉种蝇) and *Pegohylemyia qinghaisenecio* (青泽菊泉种蝇) in 1984, as well as *Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis*, *Pegomya crinisternita*, and *Pegomya tenuiramula* in 1982. Collaborative efforts led to the co-establishment of the subgenus **Deliomyia** (1988) and **Sinolucilia** (1965), and the description of *Lispe anthomyioides* (1988) and *Egle anthomyioides*. Notable works from 1982 include *Hypoderma qinghaiense* and *Calliphora zaidamensis* (1984).  \n\nTheir legacy is further underscored by descriptions of **Phaonia** species such as *Phaonia lucidula*, *Phaonia insetitibia*, *Phaonia paucispina*, and *Phaonia latimargina*, often in collaboration with Fang. In 1990, FAN described *Syngamoptera gigas* and *Syngamoptera angustifrons*, while 1988 saw the subspecies *Adia grisella asiatica* and *Mesembrina resplendens ciliimaculata* (1965). Additional genera and species attributed to FAN include *Ceylonomyia* (1981), *Bengalia (Ochromyia) taiwanensis* (1981), *Polleniopsis lata* and *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, and *Tuberomembrana* (1981). They also described *Xenotachina* species as new to science and co-established the subgenus *Paradichosia blaesostyla* and *Paradichosia kangdingensis*.  \n\nFAN’s research was published in prominent journals such as *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, *昆虫学研究集刊*, and *昆虫分类学报*, solidifying their role in advancing entomological taxonomy in China. Their work on genera like *Alliopsis* (e.g., *Alliopsis gigantosternita*, *Alliopsis rectiforceps*, *Alliopsis heterophalla*) and *Pierretia bihami* (1981 with Qian) highlights their interdisciplinary impact. With a career spanning critical taxonomic advancements and collaborations, FAN’s contributions remain foundational to the study of Chinese Diptera.\",295\n1315,CALYTHEA CHENI,\"Calythea cheni is a species of fly described by Fan in 1965, characterized by a single row of lower orbital bristles in males, a body length of 3.3-4.0 mm, and distribution in Liaoning, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Tibet, and Shandong (Jinan) domestically.>\",5\n1658,SYNGAMOPTERA GIGAS,,3\n1661,SYNGAMOPTERA ANGUSTIFRONS,,3\n3771,CALLIPHORA ZAIDAMENSIS,\"A species of blowfly with a body length of 8.0-12.0 mm, described by Fan in 1965.

It is recognized as a sub-tribe within the larger tribe **Protodexiini**, which itself belongs to the family Tachinidae, a group of parasitoid flies. The tribe BLAESOXIPHINI is specifically defined by its inclusion of the genus **Blaesoxipha**, which is the sole representative attributed to this taxonomic group. Fan’s original work in 1965 introduced the tribe to classify and organize species within the Protodexiini framework, emphasizing distinct morphological or ecological characteristics that differentiate Blaesoxipha from other genera in the broader tribe. While the primary description highlights its establishment and the genus it contains, the secondary context situates it hierarchically within Protodexiini, clarifying its placement in the tachinid classification system. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the authorship (Fan, 1965), the tribe’s name, and its taxonomic scope. The summary integrates these details to reflect its role as a specialized sub-group within Protodexiini, centered on the genus Blaesoxipha. This tribe is significant for its contribution to the systematic study of tachinid flies, particularly in delineating evolutionary or ecological relationships among related genera. Further research may expand its composition or refine its phylogenetic position, but as established, BLAESOXIPHINI remains a key taxonomic unit in the classification of this insect group.\",3\n270,BURMANOMYIA,\"\n\n**Burmanomyia** is a genus of flies primarily associated with Myanmar, characterized by distinct morphological features that differentiate it from other related genera. The genus is notable for its sexually dimorphic traits, with females exhibiting a prominently red-colored sixth tergite, a feature that likely serves as a taxonomic marker for identification. Males, on the other hand, possess a uniquely flower-shaped phallic membrane, a structure that may play a role in reproductive behavior or species recognition. Additionally, both sexes display well-developed lateral processes and central processes with lateral branches, which are structural adaptations potentially linked to ecological or behavioral functions. These anatomical details, particularly the combination of the red sixth tergite in females and the specialized male genitalia, are critical for classifying and distinguishing *Burmanomyia* within the broader context of fly taxonomy. The genus’s association with Myanmar highlights its regional biodiversity significance, though further studies may clarify its distribution and ecological niche. Overall, *Burmanomyia* exemplifies the diversity of morphological adaptations in flies, with its defining traits offering insights into evolutionary patterns and taxonomic relationships.\",3\n4890,TSINANENSIS,\"Heteronychia tsinanensis Fan, 1964 is a species with a body length of 10 mm, found in Shandong (Jinan).\",3\n1061,DELIOMYIIA,\"Deliomyia is a subgenus within the genus Subhylemyia, established by Fan in 1988 to classify species like Subhylemyia lineola with distinct aedeagus morphology\",2\n1797,HYDROTAEA HSIAI,\"A species of fly described by Fan in 1965, associated with figure 434\",2\n1997,MESAMBRIANA MERIDIANA NUDIPARAFACIA,A subspecies of Mesembrina meridiana described by Fan in 1965.

Fan's work in 1965 remains a key reference in the field, as it introduced the Blaesoxiphini tribe as a distinct taxonomic entity, enabling further research and analysis of its members.\",298\n9056,BURMANOMYIA,FAN,Burmanomyia was established by Fan in 1964,298\n9211,FAN,TSINANENSIS,Fan is the author who described Heteronychia tsinanensis in 1964,298\n1364,FAN,DELIOMYIIA,Fan established the subgenus Deliomyia in 1988,297\n2998,HYDROTAEA HSIAI,FAN,Fan is the scientific author who described Hydrotaea hsiai,297\n3361,FAN,MESAMBRIANA MERIDIANA NUDIPARAFACIA,Fan described the subspecies Mesembrina meridiana nudiparafacia in 1965,297\n3625,MUSCA CHUI,FAN,Fan described the species *Musca chui* in 1965,297\n6789,FAN,HYPOPYGIOPSIS FORTIS,Fan described the species in 1965,297\n360,华蕨蝇属 SINOCROSIA,FAN,Fan described the Sinochrosia genus,296\n631,FAN,STROBILOMYIA MELANIOLA,Fan is the describer of the species Strobilomyia melaniola,296\n1016,FAN,HYLEMIA BRUNEIPALPIS,Fan described the species Hylemya bruneipalpis in 1982,296\n2771,FAN,XENOTACHINA ZHIBENENSIS,Fan described the Xenotachina zhibenensis species,296\n2772,FAN,XENOTACHINA FUMIFEMORALIS,Fan described the Xenotachina fumifemoralis species,296\n2773,FAN,XENOTACHINA FLAVIVENTRIS,Fan described the Xenotachina flaviventris species,296\n2774,FAN,XENOTACHINA PROFEMORALIS,Fan described the Xenotachina profemoralis species,296\n2775,FAN,XENOTACHINA CHONGQINGENSIS,Fan described the Xenotachina chongqingensis species,296\n2776,FAN,XENOTACHINA PULCHELLIFRONS,Fan described the Xenotachina pulchellifrons species,296\n6650,FAN,LUCILIA HAINANENSIS,Fan is the author of the species Lucilia hainanensis,296\n6651,FAN,LUCILIA SHENYANGENSIS,Fan is the author of the species Lucilia shenyangensis,296\n6734,LUCILIA (PHAEINICIA) SHANSIENSIS,FAN,Fan described *Lucilia (Phaenicia) shansiensis*,296\n6821,FAN,HYPOPYGIOPSIS VIOLACEA,Fan described the species Hypopygiopsis violacea,296\n6976,FAN,CALLIPHORA (ABONESIA) GENARUM,Fan is the author of the species Calliphora (Abonesia) genarum,296\n7248,FAN,CHINESE COMMON FLIES MANUAL,Fan authored entries in the Chinese Common Flies Manual,296\n7452,FAN,POLLENIA RUDIS,Fan described the species Pollenia rudis in 1965,296\n9035,TUBEROMEMBRANA,FAN,Fan described the genus Tuberomembrana in 1981,296\n9275,FAN,TRICHOLOIOPROCTIA,Fan is linked to the genus *Tricholioproctia*,296\n614,LIAONING,EGLE ANTHOMYIOIDES,Egle anthomyioides is distributed in Liaoning,229\n8594,JAPAN,METOPIA AMAMIENSIS,Japan is a foreign distribution site for Metopia amamiensis,224\n1042,HYLEMIA SUPRAORBITALIS,HEILONGJIANG,\"Hylemya supraorbitalis is distributed in Heilongjiang, China\",198\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
