Its distribution includes specific regions in China such as Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, and Xinjiang.\",19\n1139,OCEANIA,\"\n\nOceania is a biogeographic region characterized by the distribution of several insect species and genera. It serves as a habitat for the species *Fucellia sp. 1431* (1431家蚕追寄蝇), which is part of the genus *Fucellia*, a group of tachinid flies known for their parasitic behavior. Additionally, Oceania hosts other *Fucellia* species, though specific names beyond *Fucellia sp. 1431* are not detailed in the provided data. The region is also home to the genus *Sarcosolomonia*, which includes species within this taxonomic group, though no specific species names are listed. Furthermore, Oceania supports the presence of three distinct species: *Muscina assimilis*, *Synthesiomyia nudiseta*, and *Passeromyia heterochaeta*, all of which are likely dipteran flies given their genus classifications. The genus *Sarcorohdendorfia* is also reported to be distributed in Oceania, though its ecological or taxonomic details are not elaborated. Collectively, these findings highlight Oceania’s role as a significant region for the biodiversity of tachinid and muscid flies, as well as other related genera. The data underscores the region’s ecological importance in supporting a range of parasitic and potentially detritivorous or predatory insect species, though further taxonomic or ecological context for the mentioned genera and species would enhance understanding. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as all consistently identify Oceania as a shared distributional range for these organisms.
