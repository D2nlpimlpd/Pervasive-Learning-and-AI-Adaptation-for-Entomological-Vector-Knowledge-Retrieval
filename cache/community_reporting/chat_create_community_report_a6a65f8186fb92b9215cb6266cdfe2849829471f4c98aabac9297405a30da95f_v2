This individual is specifically noted for their work in collecting adult specimens of the species across diverse ecological settings, including orchards, forests, cultivated lands, grasslands, animal carcasses, sheep pens, and indoor environments. The study, which focused on the biology, distribution, or behavior of *Eudasyphora cyanicolor*, was likely part of entomological research in the Xinjiang region, where the researcher's fieldwork involved systematic sampling in both natural and human-modified habitats. The 1981 citation highlights their contribution to understanding the species' ecological preferences and potential interactions with agricultural or pastoral systems, given the inclusion of sites like sheep pens and cultivated areas. While the exact findings of the study are not detailed, the breadth of collection locations suggests a comprehensive approach to documenting the fly's habitat range and life cycle. The entity \"\"钱\"\" thus represents a scholar whose work in the early 1980s advanced knowledge of *Eudasyphora cyanicolor* in China, particularly in Xinjiang, through field-based research and taxonomic analysis.

The region hosts the Chinese endemic species *Dichaetomyia bibax*, as well as *Aplomyia*, a genus of flies. It is also home to 瘦喙近脉花蝇 (slender-billed near-veined flower fly) and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*. Notably, Tibet serves as a domestic distribution location for *Delia echinata* and the species 1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇 (1464 Sumatran narrow-cheeked parasitic fly), with the latter’s catalog number included in its name. The region supports Dasyphora species, and Rypellia (possibly a typo for *Pyrellia*; clarification needed) is documented in multiple locations, including Linzhi, Bomi Yigong, Cayu, Bomi, and Baxiong Ranwu. \n\nTibet is part of the distribution range for 黑瓣莫蝇 (*Pyrellia cyanicolor*), a species whose name appears in both Chinese and Latin. The autonomous region is also a key habitat for 兔裸皮蝇 (hare skin fly) in China’s southwest and 紫鼻狂蝇 (purple-nosed horn fly). Additionally, it is the type locality for 角板鬃粪蝇 (horned plate bristle fly), with the specific site being Aasan Tree (亚东阿桑树) in Subeast (Subeast may refer to a local area or a misrendered term; further verification required). The region is explicitly noted as the domestic distribution area for 西藏疣麻蝇 (*Sarcophaga tibetana*, 1289), a species named after Tibet. \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to Tibet as a \"\"province,\"\" this is inaccurate; it is officially an autonomous region. The data collectively highlight Tibet’s ecological role in supporting diverse fly populations, including both endemic and regionally distributed species. Specific localities within Tibet, such as Linzhi and Bomi Yigong, are critical for certain genera like Rypellia. The inclusion of scientific names in both Chinese and Latin (e.g., *Pyrellia cyanicolor* for 黑瓣莫蝇) underscores the region’s importance in entomological studies. Catalog numbers (e.g., 1464, 1289) suggest these species are part of formal taxonomic records.

Yunnan is also a key habitat for the genus *Isomyia*, with specific species like *Isomyia xishuangensis*, *Isomyia pentochaeta*, and *Isomyia furcicula* found there. The province hosts *Protocalliphora azurea*, a species associated with its capital city, Kunming, as well as *Harpagophalla kempi*, which is present in regions such as Xishuangbanna, Yunjinghong, and Mengzhe. Additionally, Yunnan is a domestic location for *Exorista rossica* and *Helina nemorum*, further highlighting its ecological significance.  \n\nAmong the notable species are the Chinese names 毛腹客夜蝇 (*Lucilia sinensis*), 云南客夜蝇, 黑瓣莫蝇, and 绥芬河莫蝇, all of which are distributed in the province. Yunnan is also a distribution area for *Pyrrellia cyanicolor* and the parasitic flies 1464苏门答腊狭颊寄蝇 and 1465松毛虫狭颊寄蝇, which are native to the region. The genus *Rypellia* is specifically documented in locations like Zhongdian and Dali, underscoring the province’s varied microhabitats. Furthermore, Yunnan is one of the domestic regions for *侧线孟蝇* (Sinapionia sp.) and *环斑孟蝇* (Ctenopsepalum sp.), as well as *疏斑纹蝇* (Chrysomya sp.), which are part of its diverse fly fauna.  \n\nThe province’s unique geographical and climatic conditions support a wide array of insect life, making it a focal point for entomological studies. Species such as *Lucilia sinensis*, *Isomyia* spp., and *Protocalliphora azurea* are particularly well-documented, with Kunming, Dali, and other areas serving as key sites for their presence.

Additionally, Moganshan is a **distribution area** for *Pyrellia cyanicolor*, indicating the species continues to inhabit or be observed in the region. The mountain is also associated with two other fly species, *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Isomyia furcicula*, which are part of its ecological or geographic context. These associations highlight Moganshan’s role as a biodiversity hotspot for specific insect taxa, particularly within the Diptera order. While the descriptions do not clarify whether *Isomyia pseudolucilia* and *Isomyia furcicula* are also type localities or merely present in the area, the confirmed status of *Pyrellia cyanicolor* as a type locality underscores the region’s importance in taxonomic research. Overall, Moganshan’s entomological significance lies in its connection to these species, contributing to scientific understanding of their habitats and distributions.
