It is home to numerous fly species, including **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Eutrichota inornata**, **Eutrichota similis**, and **Parasarcophaga polystylata**. The province hosts multiple **Helina** species such as **Helina calceataeformis**, **Helina quadrum**, **Helina hirtifemorata**, **Helina hengshanensis**, and **Helina obscuratoides**, with the Yanbei region specifically noted for some of these. **Lydella grisescens** and **Phryxe vulgaris** are also documented in Shanxi. The genus **Nupedia** includes **Nupedia aestiva**, **Nupedia patellans**, and **Nupedia infirma**, while **Polleniopsis mongolica** and **Adia** species are present.  \n\nShanxi is a key location for **Phaonia** species, with **Phaonia graciloides**, **Phaonia vulpinus**, **Phaonia submontana**, **Phaonia xingxianensis**, **Phaonia wenshuiensis**, **Phaonia yanggaoensis**, **Phaonia xiangningensis**, **Phaonia youyuensis**, and **Phaonia longifurca** reported. The province also supports **Coenosia** species like **Coenosia dilatitarsis**, **Coenosia mollicula**, **Coenosia incisurata**, and **Coenosia strigipes**, as well as **Hydrotaea bimaculatoides** and **Hydrotaea occulta**. Specific cities and regions within Shanxi, such as **Taiyuan** (where **Leucophora shanxiensis**, **Leucophora personata**, and **Leucophora dorsalis** are found), **Xian** (for **Calliphora axata** and **Phormia regina**), **Hanzhong** (for **Graphomya rufitibia**), and **Changzhi** (for **614裸蹠芒蝇**), are highlighted as focal points for certain species.  \n\nAdditional notable species include **Musca autumnalis**, **Musca bezzii**, **Musca conducens**, **Musca tempestiva**, **Muscina assimilis** (in Xingxian), **Haematobia**, **Cynomyiomima stackelbergi**, **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, **Calliphora nigribarbis**, **Chionomyia vetula**, **Fannia similis**, **Fannia scalaris**, **Hebecnema alba**, **Mydaea discimana**, **Mydaea laxidetrita**, **Servaisia rossica**, **Sarcophaga erythrura**, **Xenotachina fumifemoralis**, **Stomorhina obsoleta**, **Voria ruralis**, **Bercaea cruentata**, **Brontaea nigrogrisea**, **Bellardia menechmoides**, **Paraprosalpia tibialis**, **Pseudonupedia intersecta**, **Kramerea schuetzei**, **Lispe monochaita**, **Lispe loewi**, and **Anthomyia procellaris**. The **Shanxi Medical College** has conducted surveys in the province, contributing to records of species like **Pegomya esuriens** and **Calythea cheni**.  \n\nShanxi’s entomological significance is further underscored by the presence of **Hydrophoria megaloba** and other **Hydrophoria** species, **I. tripartita**, **Pales pavida** (蓝黑栉寄蝇), **Gonia picea**, **Cynomya mortuorum**, **Dolichocolon klapperichi**, **Paregle densibarbata**, **732 HEYUAN HUI FLY** (1351 Microspine Pierretia Fly), and **1278靴折麻蝇** and **1279膨端折麻蝇**.

The term \"\"type locality\"\" refers to the specific geographic location where a species is first discovered and described, making Hanzhong a critical site for taxonomic research related to these organisms. While the descriptions provided emphasize Hanzhong's role in the context of these species, they all consistently identify it as a city within Shaanxi Province, China. No contradictions exist in the data, as all references align on its administrative classification and ecological significance. The city's association with these species highlights its importance in biodiversity studies and insect taxonomy, though further details about the ecological or historical context of these associations are not included in the provided information.\",3\n2071,XI'AN,\"\n\nXi'an is a city located in Shaanxi province, China, and is recognized as a habitat for *Musca bezzii*, a species of housefly. The city's geographical position in the northwest region of China places it within a historically and culturally significant area, though the provided data emphasizes its ecological relevance in relation to this specific insect species. *Musca bezzii*, commonly known as the tsetse fly, is notable for its role in transmitting diseases such as African trypanosomiasis, though its presence in Xi'an may reflect local environmental conditions or research contexts. The descriptions confirm Xi'an's administrative and geographical ties to Shaanxi province, aligning with broader regional classifications. No contradictions exist between the two statements, as both consistently identify Xi'an as a city in Shaanxi while the first adds a specific ecological detail.
