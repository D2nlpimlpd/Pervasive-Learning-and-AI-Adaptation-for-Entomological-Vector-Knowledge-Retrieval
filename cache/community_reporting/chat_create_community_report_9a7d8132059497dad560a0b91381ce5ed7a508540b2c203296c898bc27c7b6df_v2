The province is home to multiple genera and species, including **Musca** (e.g., *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, *Musca hervei*, *Musca crassirostris*, *Musca conducens*, *Musca sorbens*), **Isomyia** (e.g., *Isomyia quadrina*, *Isomyia viridiscutellata*, *Isomyia nebulosa*, *Isomyia cupreoviridis*, *I. divisa*, *I. tripartita*), and **Emmesomyia** (e.g., *Emmesomyia megastigmata*, *Emmesomyia kemp*, *海南粪泉蝇*, *大孔粪泉蝇*). Specific locations within Hainan, such as **Dianluo**, **Baisha**, **Xinglong**, **Wuzhishan**, **Tongshi**, **Nada**, **Qiongzhong**, **Haikou**, **Wanning**, and **Baoting**, are highlighted as sub-regions where these species are found.  \n\nNotable species include the **Star Island Greenbottle Fly**, **Metoposisyrops scirpophagae**, **Chrysomya pinguis**, **Chrysomya megacephala**, **Chrysomya bezziana**, **Alisarcophaga gressitti**, **Parasarcophaga hui**, **Lispe loewi**, **Strongyloneura prasina**, **Ceylonomyia nigripes**, **Anthomyia plumiseta**, **Achoetandrus rufifacies**, **Haematobia minuta**, **Stomoxys sitiens**, **Stomoxys uruma**, and **Carcelia kockiana**. Additionally, Hainan hosts species such as **611扁蹠芒蝇**, **614裸蹠芒蝇**, **1337耳阳细麻蝇**, **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**, **1399胡氏亚麻蝇**, and **732 HEYUAN HUI FLY**, with the latter being the type locality for *1399胡氏亚麻蝇*. The **FLY GENUS** is also documented in Hainan, where **ZHANG BAOLIN** conducted research.  \n\nHainan is further recognized as a distribution area for **Bengalia species** (e.g., *Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri*), **Hypopygiopsis infumata** (including **Xinglong** as a sub-region), and **Morellia hainanensis**. However, it is explicitly noted that **Calliphora vomitoria** is not reported in the province. The region also supports **Silbomyia hoeneana**, **Caiusa coomani**, and **Graphomya rufitibia** (found in **Wuzhishan**, **Tongshi**, **Nada**, and **Qiongzhong**).  \n\nIn summary, HAINAN serves as a critical hub for entomological diversity in China, with extensive records of fly species across its ecological zones. The province’s cities and sub-regions, such as **Xinglong**, **Nada**, and **Sanya**, are frequently cited in distribution studies, underscoring its role as a focal area for both common and specialized fly populations. Research efforts, including those by **ZHANG BAOLIN**, have further enriched understanding of Hainan’s unique faunal assemblages, while the absence of *Calliphora vomitoria* highlights regional ecological distinctions. This comprehensive overview reflects Hainan’s importance in documenting and studying fly biodiversity within China.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",79\n5073,PIERRETTIA ZHOUQUENSIS,\"A species of fly with a body length of 7.0 mm, distributed in China (Hainan, Ledong Jianfengling) and internationally in the Soviet Union (Far East, Caucasus, Ukraine, Russia).♂ specimens have a pair of small, membranous processes with petal-like lateral branches and slender, forward-curving abdominal setae.♀ characteristics are unknown.\",2\n2100,YINGGEN,\"Yinggen is a city in Hainan province, China\",1\n2101,TONGSHI,\"\n\nTONGSHI is a city located in Hainan province, China, and is recognized as a significant geographical entity within the region. It is specifically noted for its association with the distribution of certain species, including *611扁蹠芒蝇* (likely a species of fly, though the full scientific name is not provided) and *614裸蹠芒蝇* (another species, similarly unnamed in full). These species are part of the broader ecological context of Tongshi, which is described as a location where they are present. Additionally, Tongshi is identified as an area within Hainan where *Musca crassirostris*, a species of fly, is distributed. While some descriptions refer to Tongshi as a \"\"region\"\" or \"\"area,\"\" the most consistent and specific designation across the data is that it is a city in Hainan. This aligns with the administrative and geographical framework of Hainan, where cities and regions often overlap in classification. The mention of multiple species highlights Tongshi’s role as a habitat or study site for entomological research, particularly for these fly species. The data does not present direct contradictions but rather varying levels of specificity in describing Tongshi’s geographical and ecological significance. In summary, Tongshi is a city in Hainan, China, notable for its connection to the distribution of *611扁蹠芒蝇*, *614裸蹠芒蝇*, and *Musca crassirostris*, underscoring its importance in regional biodiversity studies. The entity’s dual characterization as both a city and a broader ecological area reflects its multifaceted relevance in scientific and administrative contexts.

These species, part of the Muscidae family, are associated with the ecological and geographical characteristics of the Baoting area, which may include its tropical climate, biodiversity, or specific habitats. The city’s role in the distribution of *Musca crassirostris* further underscores its significance in regional entomological studies. While the descriptions emphasize Baoting’s connection to these species, they collectively confirm its status as a distinct administrative and geographical entity within Hainan. The city is likely part of a broader network of locations where these species thrive, contributing to local ecological dynamics. No contradictions exist in the provided data, as all descriptions align on Baoting’s identity as a Hainan-based location linked to the mentioned species. The summary integrates the entity’s administrative classification (city/region) and its biological relevance, ensuring coherence and completeness.\",1\n2103,BAISHA,\"\n\n**BAISHA** is a location situated in Hainan province, China, and is recognized as part of the geographical distribution range of the species *Musca crassirostris*. While one description refers to it as a \"\"city,\"\" this likely reflects a broader or colloquial understanding of the term, as Hainan is home to several administrative divisions, including cities like Sanya and Haikou, but Baisha itself is more accurately characterized as a district or town within the province. Its significance lies in its ecological relevance to *Musca crassirostris*, a species of fly whose habitat and range are studied in entomological contexts. The mention of Baisha in relation to this species highlights its role as a regional point of interest for biodiversity research, though no further details about the local environment or specific studies conducted there are provided in the data.
