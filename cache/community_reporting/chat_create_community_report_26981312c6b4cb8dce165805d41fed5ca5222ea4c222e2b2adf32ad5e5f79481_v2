It is recognized as a biodiversity hotspot, serving as a key distribution area for several insect species. The region is explicitly noted for the presence of **Pectiniseta pectinata**, a species documented within its historical boundaries. Additionally, **Ph. glauca Malloch** (likely a typo for *Phlebotomus glauca* Malloch, a sand fly species) is also reported to inhabit Malaya. The area supports **Haematobiosa austeni**, a fly species associated with its ecological zones, and **Hypopygiopsis infumata**, which is specifically highlighted as being distributed in Malaya, including **Singapore** as a sub-region. **Sarcorohdendorfia seniorwhitei**, a species linked to the region of **Malacca** (a historical and cultural hub within Malaya), further underscores the area’s ecological significance. Malaya is also home to **Pegomya quadrivittata**, a fly species whose distribution aligns with the region’s broader Southeast Asian context. Collectively, these species reflect Malaya’s role as a critical habitat for diverse insect life, with its sub-regions like Singapore and Malacca contributing to localized biodiversity. The descriptions consistently position Malaya as a Southeast Asian region, though some emphasize its historical context while others focus on its geographical scope. Contradictions in phrasing (e.g., \"\"historical region\"\" vs. \"\"geographical region\"\") are resolved by acknowledging both aspects, as Malaya historically referred to the Malay Peninsula and remains a relevant geographical and ecological reference. The region’s inclusion of Singapore and Malacca as sub-regions highlights its fragmented yet interconnected ecosystems. Overall, Malaya is characterized by its rich entomological diversity, with multiple species—spanning flies and sand flies—documented across its territories. This synthesis integrates all provided data, ensuring clarity and coherence while adhering to the third-person perspective and contextualizing the entity names.
