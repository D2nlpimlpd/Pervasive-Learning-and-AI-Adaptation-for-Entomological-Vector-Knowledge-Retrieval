Its body length is 7.5-8 mm.>\",15\n1803,TURKEY,,18\n1475,PALESTINE,\"\n\nPalestine, a region in the Middle East, is noted for its role as a habitat for various insect species, particularly flies and parasitic organisms. It is described as a country where **Sarcophaga haematodes**, a species of flesh fly, is distributed, and it is also part of the regions referenced in a taxonomic key for the **Sarcophagini** family, which includes blow flies and related species. Additionally, Palestine has foreign distribution records for **Musca crassirostris**, a fly species typically associated with other geographic areas, suggesting either recent introductions or underreported occurrences in the region.  \n\nThe region is further highlighted as a location where the **Helicophagella** genus, a group of flies, is found, alongside multiple species of the **Stomorhina** genus, which are likely native or well-established there. **Pegomya exilis**, a fly species known to parasitize **Hyoscyamus aureus** (a plant in the nightshade family), is also reported to be distributed in Palestine, underscoring the region’s ecological significance in host-parasite interactions. Similarly, **Peribaea orbata**, a species of hoverfly, is documented as occurring in Palestine, contributing to its biodiversity profile.  \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to Palestine as a \"\"country,\"\" others use \"\"region,\"\" reflecting its complex geopolitical status. The term \"\"foreign distribution records\"\" in the case of **Musca crassirostris** may indicate that the species is not native to Palestine but has been observed there, possibly due to migration or human activity. In contrast, species like **Sarcophaga haematodes**, **Stomorhina** spp., **Pegomya exilis**, and **Peribaea orbata** are presented as naturally occurring in the region. The inclusion of Palestine in taxonomic keys for **Sarcophagini** suggests its relevance in entomological studies, particularly for identifying and classifying flies within this family.  \n\nOverall, Palestine serves as a notable area for the distribution of diverse insect taxa, including both native and non-native species. Its role in supporting species such as **Sarcophaga haematodes**, **Stomorhina** spp., **Pegomya exilis**, and **Peribaea orbata**, as well as its connection to parasitic interactions and taxonomic research, highlights its ecological and scientific importance. The region’s status as a crossroads for species with both local and foreign records further emphasizes its dynamic biodiversity context.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",2\n4704,SAUDI ARABIA,\"\n\nSaudi Arabia, a country located in the Arabian Peninsula, is highlighted in the provided data as a region of ecological and taxonomic significance for specific insect species. It is noted as a distribution site for *Sarcophaga haematodes*, a species of blowfly, and *Blaesoxipha gladiatrix*, another fly species, both of which are part of the Sarcophaginae subfamily. Additionally, the Helicophagella genus, a group of flies within the Sarcophagidae family, is also documented as being present in the country. These findings position Saudi Arabia as a key area for studying the biodiversity and geographic range of Sarcophagini, a tribe of flies that includes carrion and flesh flies. The data further specifies that Saudi Arabia is explicitly mentioned in a taxonomic key for Sarcophagini, indicating its relevance as a reference region for identifying and classifying species within this group. While the term \"\"foreign country\"\" appears in some descriptions, this likely reflects the perspective of the text’s intended audience rather than an inherent characteristic of Saudi Arabia itself. Collectively, the information underscores Saudi Arabia’s role in the ecological distribution of these fly species and its inclusion in scientific frameworks for their taxonomic analysis. The country’s arid and semi-arid environments, as well as its unique geographical position, may contribute to the presence and study of such species, which are often associated with decomposition processes and ecological niches in diverse climates. This synthesis of data emphasizes the intersection of Saudi Arabia’s natural habitats with entomological research, particularly in the context of Sarcophagini taxonomy and species distribution.\",1\n2214,DEGEER,\"\n\n**DEGEER** is a historical entomologist recognized for his significant contributions to the classification of fly species in the 18th century. In 1776, he first described the species *Musca autumnalis*, which is now commonly known as the autumn housefly. This species, a member of the family Muscidae, is notable for its seasonal activity and role in disease transmission. Additionally, DEGEER is credited as the author of *Lispe tentaculata*, a species later reclassified under the genus *Lispe* (family Syrphidae), though some sources previously cited it as *Musca tentaculata* before taxonomic revisions. His work on this species highlights his early efforts in distinguishing hoverflies from other muscoid flies.  \n\nDEGEER also described *Siphona geniculata* in 1776, a species now classified under the genus *Siphona* (family Syrphidae), further demonstrating his focus on syrphid flies. The descriptions provided in the data reflect both his original classifications and subsequent taxonomic changes, as scientific nomenclature has evolved over time. For instance, the mention of *Musca tentaculata* in one source aligns with *Lispe tentaculata* in another, indicating that DEGEER’s initial placement of the species under the genus *Musca* was later corrected to *Lispe*. Similarly, the Chinese description notes his role as the first to describe *Musca autumnalis*, corroborating the Western sources.  \n\nDespite minor discrepancies in genus names across historical records, DEGEER’s work remains foundational in entomology. His 1776 contributions to the taxonomy of flies, including the autumn housefly and various syrphid species, established early frameworks for understanding these insects’ morphology and ecological roles. As a scientist of the 18th century, DEGEER operated during a period of rapid biological classification, often relying on morphological traits to categorize species before modern genetic and ecological methods became available. His legacy is preserved in the continued use of his species descriptions, even as some have been updated to reflect contemporary scientific consensus.  \n\nIn summary, DEGEER is acknowledged as a pioneering entomologist who described *Musca autumnalis* (autumn housefly), *Lispe tentaculata* (formerly *Musca tentaculata*), and *Siphona geniculata* in 1776. His work, while subject to later taxonomic adjustments, laid critical groundwork for the study of flies and underscores his role in the early development of entomological science. The variations in genus names across sources reflect the dynamic nature of taxonomic classification rather than contradictions in DEGEER’s original work.\",3\n2213,秋家蝇,秋家蝇 (Musca autumnalis DeGeer) 是一种橙黄色的蝇类，♀个体若呈黑色则第一、二合背板的腹缘不呈黑色。其体长4.5-7.5毫米，是牛的眼中线虫 (Thelazia rhodesii) 的中间宿主，雌蝇将卵产于较新的牛粪上，幼虫在25°C时需约9天完成发育。分布于中国河北、山西、宁夏、甘肃、新疆、青海，以及欧洲大部（瑞典为模式产地）、叙利亚、土耳其、印度（克什米尔）、巴基斯坦、北非和北美。,10\n1802,AFGHANISTAN,,5\n6168,MUSCA AUTUMNALIS,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n8892,BLAESOXIPHA GLADIATRIX,PANDELLE,Pandelle described Blaesoxipha gladiatrix in 1896,31\n3137,TURKEY,THRICOPS SEMICINEREUS,Thricops semicinereus is found in Turkey,26\n10338,PALESTINE,PERIBAEA ORBATA,Peribaea orbata is distributed in Palestine,18\n8899,BLAESOXIPHA GLADIATRIX,SAUDI ARABIA,Blaesoxipha gladiatrix is distributed in Saudi Arabia,16\n4925,DEGEER,LISPE TENTACULATA,DeGeer described the species Lispe tentaculata in 1776,15\n3704,秋家蝇,DEGEER,DeGeer 是秋家蝇的首次描述者,13\n3019,HYDROTAEA PANDELLEI,AFGHANISTAN,Hydrotaea pandellei is distributed in Afghanistan,12\n11934,DEGEER,MUSCA AUTUMNALIS,DeGeer described the species Musca autumnalis in 1776,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
