Altitudinal records, such as 2400 meters in Manshan and Akesu, highlight the region’s varied habitats. Xinjiang is also associated with the Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing as a domestic reference area for entomological studies. The data underscores its role as a biodiversity hotspot for flies, with multiple species coexisting in its ecosystems, including rare or regionally endemic taxa like *Drymeia xinjiangensis* and *Pegohylemyia pulvinata*. Despite some descriptions using \"\"province\"\" or \"\"region\"\" interchangeably, the consistent focus on Xinjiang’s ecological significance for these species remains clear.

Additionally, Xinyuan serves as the **type locality** for *Pegomya crinilamella*, meaning it is the specific location where this species was first identified and described. The region’s biodiversity is further highlighted by its role as a sublocation in Xinjiang where *Heteronychia heptapotamica* is documented. While the descriptions emphasize Xinyuan’s connection to these species, they collectively underscore its importance as a hub for studying dipteran (true fly) and other insect populations in the broader Xinjiang area. The repeated references to Xinjiang as the overarching region align with the data, and no contradictions exist in the entity’s identification as a county or its ecological associations. This synthesis integrates all provided information into a cohesive overview of Xinyuan’s entomological significance.\",4\n963,CHANGJI,\"\n\nChangji is a city located in Xinjiang province, China, and serves as a geographical reference point for the distribution and association of specific species.

The lake's unique environment in Xinjiang supports the distribution of this species, highlighting its role in regional biodiversity. As a high-altitude lake in the Tianshan Mountains, Kanas Lake is part of a protected area renowned for its pristine natural landscapes and diverse ecosystems, which likely contribute to the presence of specialized fauna such as *Delia penicillosa*.
