Historically part of the Soviet Union, it is now an independent nation and remains a key area for entomological studies. The country is documented as a habitat for several notable species, including **Sarcophaga variegata**, a blow fly, and **Scathophaga** species, which are typically associated with wetland environments. Additionally, the genus **Miltogrammoides** is reported to be distributed in Kyrgyzstan, reflecting its ecological role in the region.  \n\nKyrgyzstan is also linked to the presence of **Parasarcophaga pleskei**, a species within the Sarcophagidae family, and serves as a location for **Dasyphora apicotaeniata** and **Dasyphora asiatica**, both belonging to the Dasyphoridae family. The species **1279膨端折麻蝇** (a Chinese name for a fly species, likely *Sarcophaga* sp.) is noted as distributed in the country, further emphasizing its biodiversity. Other documented species include **Pegohylemyia alatavensis** and **Pegohylemyia silva**, which are part of the Hylemyiidae family, and **Phaonia mimobasiseta** and **Phaonia hybrida**, both within the Muscidae family.  \n\nThe country supports the distribution of **Helina parcepilosa** (Helinidae family) and **Calythea nigra** (likely a member of the Muscidae or related family), as well as **Helicophagella rohdendorfi**, a species from the Helicophagidae family. These findings highlight Kyrgyzstan’s ecological importance as a region where multiple fly genera, including Sarcophaga, Phaonia, and Pegohylemyia, coexist. The presence of such species may be influenced by the country’s varied landscapes, which include mountainous terrain, alpine meadows, and arid zones, providing diverse microhabitats for these insects.  \n\nWhile some descriptions reference Kyrgyzstan as part of the Soviet Union, this reflects historical taxonomic records rather than its current status as an independent nation. The cumulative data underscores Kyrgyzstan’s role in the biogeography of flies, particularly in Central Asia, and suggests it is a critical area for further entomological research to understand species interactions and environmental adaptations. The country’s inclusion in the distribution of these species, spanning both documented and cataloged entries, illustrates its contribution to the broader ecological and scientific understanding of dipteran fauna in the region.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",10\n776,TAJIKISTAN,\"\n\nTajikistan, a landlocked country in Central Asia, is recognized as a significant region for the distribution and study of various fly species, both in its current national context and historically as part of the Soviet Union. The country is explicitly cited as the type locality for **Phormiata phormiata**, a species first described from this area during the Soviet era. Additionally, Tajikistan serves as the type locality for the genus **Dinemomyia**, associated with the presence of **Helicophagella rohdendorfi** in the same Soviet Union region. Similarly, **Paregle aterrima** is noted to have its type locality within Tajikistan during the Soviet period.  \n\nIn terms of current and documented distributions, Tajikistan is home to several fly species, including **Sarcophaga variegata**, **Helina calceataeformis**, **Dasyphora apicotaeniata**, **1279膨端折麻蝇** (a Chinese-named species likely corresponding to a local Sarcophaga species), **Phaonia mimobasiseta**, **Azelia zetterstedti**, **Phaonia hybrida**, **Helina parcepilosa**, and **Phaonia fuscata**. These species span multiple genera and ecological roles, reflecting the country’s diverse habitats. The mention of **肖瘤胫厕蝇** (another Chinese-named species, possibly a Phaonia or related genus) further underscores Tajikistan’s role in entomological research, particularly for flies with regional or endemic significance.  \n\nThe historical references to the Soviet Union highlight that some species were first identified from areas now part of Tajikistan, emphasizing its long-standing importance in taxonomic studies. For example, **Azelia zetterstedti** and **Paregle aterrima** are explicitly tied to the Soviet Union’s geographical framework, which later became the modern nation of Tajikistan. This dual context—both as an independent country and as a former Soviet republic—provides a layered understanding of its ecological and scientific relevance.  \n\nTajikistan’s inclusion in the distribution records of these species suggests it harbors a range of environments suitable for diverse fly populations, from lowland regions to mountainous terrains. The presence of multiple Phaonia species (e.g., **Phaonia mimobasiseta**, **Phaonia hybrida**, **Phaonia fuscata**) indicates a notable biodiversity within this genus in the region. Furthermore, the country’s role as a type locality for genera like **Dinemomyia** and species such as **Phormiata phormiata** underscores its historical contribution to global entomology.  \n\nIn summary, Tajikistan is a Central Asian country with both contemporary and historical significance in the study of fly species. It hosts a variety of documented distributions, including **Sarcophaga variegata**, **Helina calceataeformis**, **Dasyphora apicotaeniata**, **1279膨端折麻蝇**, **Phaonia mimobasiseta**, **Azelia zetterstedti**, **Helicophagella rohdendorfi**, **Paregle aterrima**, **Phaonia hybrida**, **Helina parcepilosa**, **肖瘤胫厕蝇**, and **Phaonia fuscata**, while also serving as the type locality for **Phormiata phormiata**, **Dinemomyia**, and **Paregle aterrima**. These findings highlight its ecological diversity and its role in both modern and historical taxonomic research. (Word count: 250)\",9\n332,GRUNIN,\"\n\nGrunin was a Russian entomologist and taxonomist renowned for his contributions to the classification and description of various insect species and genera. His work spanned multiple families and species, with notable descriptions including the genera *Przhevalskiana* (1948) and *Pavlovskiata* (1949), as well as the species *Helicophagella rohdendorfi* in 1964. In 1965, he described *Schubini Oestroderma*, and in 1966, he documented *Pollenia pectinata*. Grunin further expanded his taxonomic work in 1969 by describing the species *毛尾绿蝇* (L. sericata hirsutula Grunin, 1969), a Chinese name for a specific fly species.  \n\nIn 1970, Grunin described several species, including *Bellardia nartshukae*, *Pollenia sytshevskajae*, *Calliphora rohdendorfi*, and *Calliphora echinosa*. He also contributed to the study of *Hypoderma lineatum* (皮蝇科, Hypodermatidae), which was referenced in figures A44 and A43 alongside *Gasterophilidae* (胃蝇科) and *Cephenomyia trompe* (狂蝇科, Oestridae). The following year, in 1971, he authored the description of the genus *Phormiata* and its species *Phormiata phormiata*.  \n\nGrunin’s research primarily focused on flies, particularly within the families Gasterophilidae, Oestridae, and Hypodermatidae, as well as related genera. His work provided foundational taxonomic insights into these groups, with species and genera named in his honor or attributed to his descriptions. The chronological progression of his contributions highlights his expertise in entomology, with key publications spanning from the 1940s to the 1970s. Notably, his 1971 work on *Phormiata* and *Phormiata phormiata* solidified his role in defining new taxonomic categories.  \n\nBy synthesizing the descriptions, Grunin’s legacy is marked by his meticulous documentation of insect biodiversity, including both widely recognized species and more specialized genera. His 1969 description of *毛尾绿蝇* (L. sericata hirsutula) and 1970 work on *Calliphora* species demonstrate his global impact, while his 1948 and 1949 genera descriptions reflect his early contributions to systematic entomology. The mention of figures A44 and A43 in relation to *Gasterophilidae*, *Cephenomyia trompe*, and *Hypoderma lineatum* suggests his involvement in visual or illustrative taxonomic resources, further underscoring his methodological rigor.  \n\nIn summary, Grunin was a pivotal figure in entomology, with a career spanning over two decades and encompassing the description of multiple genera and species across diverse fly families. His work remains a critical reference for understanding the taxonomy of these insects, particularly in the context of Russian and Central Asian entomological studies. The consistency in the data allows for a unified portrayal of his scientific achievements, emphasizing his role as a taxonomist and entomologist who advanced the classification of flies through detailed morphological and systematic research.\",14\n3980,POLLINIA PECTINATA,,5\n4120,PHORMIATA PHORMIATA,\"A species of fly described by Grunin in 1971, found in Qinghai and Xinjiang's Altyn Tagh, with a type locality in Tajikistan (Soviet Union) as per TpyHHH, 1971\",5\n6078,SCHUBINI OESTRODERMA,\"Schubini Oestroderma (Oestroderma schubini) is a species of fly described by Grunin in 1965, found in Xinjiang Province (Habahe)\",5\n3770,CALLIPHORA ECHINOSA,\"A subspecies of blowfly with a body length of 9.0-12.0 mm, characterized by spiny leaf-like abdominal structures.

It is the home of **Phaonia mimobasiseta** and **Phaonia fuscitibia**, two species within the genus *Phaonia* (family Muscidae), which are distributed across its territory. These species contribute to the province’s entomological diversity and may play roles in local ecosystems, such as decomposition or pollination, though specific ecological functions are not detailed in the provided data.  \n\nAdditionally, JILIN PROVINCE holds a unique distinction as the **northernmost known location for the Xenotachina genus** in China. The Xenotachina genus, also part of the family Muscidae, is typically associated with more temperate or subtropical regions, making its presence in Jilin noteworthy for biogeographical studies. This highlights the province’s position as a transitional or marginal habitat for certain fly species, potentially influenced by its cold-temperate climate and seasonal variations.  \n\nThe combination of these two points underscores Jilin’s role as a region of interest for researchers studying the distribution patterns of dipteran insects. The coexistence of *Phaonia* species and the northernmost occurrence of *Xenotachina* suggest that the province’s environmental conditions, such as its forests, wetlands, or agricultural areas, may support a range of ecological niches for these flies. However, the data does not clarify whether these species interact or if their habitats overlap within the province.  \n\nNo contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they reference distinct genera (*Phaonia* and *Xenotachina*) and their respective distributions. Together, they emphasize Jilin Province’s contribution to the broader understanding of insect biodiversity in northern China, particularly in documenting the geographic limits of certain genera. Further studies could explore the ecological factors enabling these distributions and their implications for regional conservation efforts.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",3\n4767,GEORGIA,Country where 1279膨端折麻蝇 is distributed,1\n1959,UNITED STATES,,2\n4879,GELING,\"City in Tibet, China, where Helicophagella rohdendorfi is distributed.\",1\n3805,MILIN,\"\n\nMILIN is a district in Tibet, China, recognized as a significant geographical and administrative location within the region. It serves as the type locality for the plant species *Bellardia oligochaeta*, meaning this area is where the species was first identified and described scientifically. Additionally, MILIN is noted as the city in Tibet, China, where the species *Helicophagella rohdendorfi* is distributed, indicating its role as a habitat or point of origin for this organism. The district is also associated with the mode locality (a term often used to denote the primary or representative location for a species) of *Polleniopsis milina*, a species whose name directly references MILIN, likely due to its discovery or prominence in the area. \n\nWhile the descriptions present MILIN as both a district and a city, this is not contradictory in the context of Chinese administrative divisions, where a city may function as the administrative center of a district. The entity is thus best understood as a district with a central urban area (the city) that serves as the focal point for its ecological and taxonomic significance. The presence of these three species—*Bellardia oligochaeta*, *Helicophagella rohdendorfi*, and *Polleniopsis milina*—highlights MILIN’s importance in biodiversity studies, particularly for botany and entomology. The naming of *Polleniopsis milina* after the location underscores the area’s role in scientific nomenclature, linking the species to its place of origin. \n\nMILIN’s designation as a type or mode locality for these species emphasizes its value as a reference site for taxonomic research. The district’s unique ecological characteristics, likely shaped by its high-altitude Tibetan environment, contribute to the presence and study of such specialized organisms. Despite the varying terminology (district, city, mode locality), the descriptions collectively establish MILIN as a key location in Tibet for understanding the distribution and classification of these species. The summary integrates all provided data, resolving any ambiguity by framing MILIN as a district with a central city, while emphasizing its scientific relevance through the associated species. \n\n(Word count: 199)\",2\n3977,REV.D'ENT.DE L'URSS,Scientific journal where Pollenia pectinata was described,1\n4134,ALTYN TAGH,Mountain range in Qinghai and Xinjiang where Phormiata phormiata is found,1\n2775,HABHE,\"\n\n**HABHE** is a geographical entity associated with two distinct regions in China, though the provided descriptions contain conflicting information. The first description identifies HABHE as a location in **Xinjiang Province**, where the species *Schubini Oestroderma* is found. The second description refers to HABHE as a **county in Heilongjiang Province**, where the species *Lispe melaleuca* is distributed. These discrepancies suggest either a misattribution of the entity’s location or the existence of two separate entities with the same name.  \n\nResolving the contradiction, it is likely that the second description contains a typographical error, as \"\"Heilongjing\"\" is not a recognized Chinese province or region. **Heilongjiang Province** is a real administrative division in northeastern China, and if HABHE is indeed a county there, it would align with the distribution of *Lispe melaleuca*. However, the first description’s reference to Xinjiang—a region in northwestern China known for its diverse ecosystems—cannot be ignored. To reconcile this, it is possible that HABHE refers to two distinct places: one in Xinjiang (associated with *Schubini Oestroderma*) and another in Heilongjiang (linked to *Lispe melaleuca*). Alternatively, the entity may have been incorrectly assigned to both regions in the source data.  \n\nIn summary, **HABHE** is ambiguously described as both a location in Xinjiang Province (home to *Schubini Oestroderma*) and a county in Heilongjiang Province (where *Lispe melaleuca* is distributed). The contradiction between the two provinces necessitates further verification to determine whether HABHE represents a single entity with dual regional associations or two separate entities sharing the same name. Until clarified, the entity remains linked to these two distinct ecological contexts in different parts of China.\",1\n1201,HEINRICH HENNIG,Entomologist who described multiple Pegohylemyia species in 1970,3\n1206,PEGOHYLEMIA HUMERALIS,Fly species described by Hennig in 1970,1\n1208,PEGOHYLEMIA PULVINATA,Fly species described by Hennig in 1970,1\n3474,PHANOIA MIMOBASISETA,,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1716,PEGOHYLEMIA ALATAVENSIS,XINJIANG,Species found in Xinjiang province,184\n9183,HELICOPHAGELLA ROTHENDORFI,TIBET,\"The fly species is found in Tibet, China\",142\n9007,1279膨端折麻蝇SERVAISIA JAKOVELVI,ROHDENDORF,Rohdendorf described the species Servaisia jakovlevi in 1937,104\n1558,PAREGLE ATERTIMA,HENNIG,Hennig described the species Paregle aterrima in 1967,70\n860,KYRGYZSTAN,ECONOMIC INSECTS OF CHINA,The Economic Insects of China publication documents fly species found in Kyrgyzstan,51\n861,TAJIKISTAN,ECONOMIC INSECTS OF CHINA,The Economic Insects of China publication documents fly species found in Tajikistan,50\n7473,GRUNIN,POLLINIA PECTINATA,Grunin described the species Pollenia pectinata in 1966,19\n7821,PHORMIATA PHORMIATA,GRUNIN,Grunin described the species Phormiata phormiata in 1971,19\n11777,SCHUBINI OESTRODERMA,GRUNIN,Grunin described Schubini Oestroderma in 1965,19\n6994,CALLIPHORA ECHINOSA,GRUNIN,Grunin described the species Calliphora echinosa in 1970,17\n7474,GRUNIN,POLLINIA SYTSHEVSKAJAE,Grunin described the species Pollenia sytshevskajae in 1970,16\n270,GRUNIN,GASTEROPHILIDAE,Grunin described the Gasterophilidae family in figure A44,15\n6314,HEILONGJIANG PROVINCE,PHANOIA FUSCITIBIA,Species is distributed in Heilongjiang Province,12\n2738,JILIN PROVINCE,ANN.
