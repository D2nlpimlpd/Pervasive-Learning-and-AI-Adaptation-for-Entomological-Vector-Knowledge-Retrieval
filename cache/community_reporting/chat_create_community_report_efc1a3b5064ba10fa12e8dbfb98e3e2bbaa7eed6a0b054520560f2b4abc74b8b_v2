It serves as the type locality for **Meliniella bisinuata**, **Hydrotaea mimopilipes**, **Delia conversata**, **Polietes nigrolimbata**, and **Leucophora tavastica**, indicating that these species were first described based on specimens collected there. Additionally, Finland is the type locality for **角缘花蝇** (*Delia canescens*), a species native to the region. The country hosts a range of distributed species, including **Helina bohemani**, **Helina ciliata**, and **Helina longicornis** (all within the genus *Helina*), as well as **Coenosia octopunctata** and **Coenosia flavicornis** (genus *Coenosia*). **Lasiomma curtigena** and **Eglconcomitans** are also documented as distributed in Finland, with the former being specifically noted as having its type locality in the country. \n\nFinland is part of the international distribution range for **Periscepsia carbonaria**, a species found beyond its native regions, and it is a key location for **Periscepsia** as a genus. The country supports **Ph. pallidisquama** (likely *Phaonia pallidisquama* or a related species) and **Paraprosalpia sepiella**, both of which are recorded in its fauna. **Delia cuneata** and **Delia floricola** are further examples of species associated with Finland, contributing to its biodiversity in the Delia genus. **Phaonia nigripennis** is described as distributed abroad, but the context implies Finland is one of its habitats. \n\nThe descriptions collectively highlight Finland’s ecological significance as a hub for diverse fly species, particularly in the genera *Helina*, *Coenosia*, *Delia*, *Phaonia*, and *Periscepsia*. Its status as a type locality for multiple species underscores its importance in taxonomic research. While some entries specify Finland as a type locality, others emphasize its role as a distribution site, with no contradictions in the data. The country’s position in Northern Europe and its varied habitats likely support this rich entomological diversity. This summary consolidates all provided information, ensuring clarity and coherence by attributing each species to Finland’s role in their distribution or taxonomy.

Among these, the genus *Helina* is represented by two species: *Helina bohemani* and *Helina longicornis*, both of which are documented as distributed within the country. Additionally, *Coenosia octopunctata*, a species of fruit fly, is found in Norway, contributing to its ecological biodiversity. The moth *Paraprosalpia sepiella* is also reported to be distributed in the region, further highlighting Norway’s role as a habitat for varied invertebrates. Another species, *Polietes nigrolimbata*, a type of hoverfly, is similarly noted as distributed in Norway. Beyond its natural habitats, Norway is associated with the publication *Dipt. Scand.*, a scientific journal focused on Scandinavian dipteran (fly) species, which was cited in the context of describing *Polietes nigrolimbata* (4:1570, Aricia). This publication underscores Norway’s significance in entomological research, particularly for documenting and studying the distribution of flies in the region. Collectively, these records illustrate Norway’s ecological importance as a location where multiple insect species, including both flies and moths, thrive, supported by its diverse environments and active scientific contributions to taxonomy and biodiversity studies.
