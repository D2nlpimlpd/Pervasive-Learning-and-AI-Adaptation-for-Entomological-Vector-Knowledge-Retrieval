It is a sovereign nation, not a city in Malaysia or a sub-region of Malaya, as some descriptions inaccurately suggest. The country serves as a distribution site for several insect species, including *Caiusa testacea*, a fly species noted for its presence in the region. Additionally, Singapore hosts the *Bengalia* species, a group of insects whose distribution is tied to the area, and *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, a fly species documented within its borders. The Neomyia genus, which includes various fly species, is also found in Singapore, further underscoring its ecological importance.  \n\nTwo specific species, *Hypopygiopsis tumrasvini* and *Hypopygiopsis infumata*, are directly associated with Singapore as their type localities. *Hypopygiopsis tumrasvini* was first described from Singapore, which is cited as its type locality, while *Hypopygiopsis infumata* is similarly linked to the country as a sub-region within historical Malaya. These designations highlight Singapore’s role in scientific discovery and taxonomy. Furthermore, the Star Island Greenbottle Fly, a species within the *Lucilia* genus, has Singapore as its type locality, indicating the country’s contribution to the study of blowflies.  \n\nThe descriptions provided contain minor inconsistencies regarding Singapore’s geopolitical status. While one incorrectly identifies it as a \"\"city in Malaysia\"\" and another as a \"\"sub-region within Malaya,\"\" the accurate context is that Singapore is a self-governing nation, having gained independence from Malaysia in 1965. These errors likely stem from outdated or imprecise terminology, as \"\"Malaya\"\" historically referred to the Malay Peninsula before the formation of modern Malaysia. The correct classification of Singapore as a country is essential for clarity in ecological and taxonomic records.  \n\nIn summary, Singapore is a key location for the distribution and type localities of multiple insect species, including *Caiusa testacea*, *Bengalia* species, *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, Neomyia species, *Hypopygiopsis tumrasvini*, *Hypopygiopsis infumata*, and the Star Island Greenbottle Fly. Its unique position as a biodiversity hotspot in Southeast Asia, combined with its status as an independent nation, makes it a critical reference point in entomological research. The country’s role in documenting these species reflects its ecological significance and the need for accurate geographical representation in scientific literature.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",8\n6214,CHRYSOYA CHANI,,2\n3792,TRICYCLOPSEOPSIS PARADOXA,\"Species of fly within the Tricycleopsis genus, first described in 1927\",3\n3791,REVUE ZOOL.
