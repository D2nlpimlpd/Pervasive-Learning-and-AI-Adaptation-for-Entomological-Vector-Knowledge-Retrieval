He first characterized the genus *Tertiuseginia* and the species *Syngamoptera chekiangensis* in the same year, with the latter publication appearing in the *Journal of the Shanghai Scientific Institute* (referred to as \"\"J, Shanghai Sci. Inst.\"\" in the data). Additionally, OUCHI described the species *Musca shanghaiensis* in 1938, though the journal of publication is noted as both the *Journal of the Shanghai Scientific Institute* and the *Indian Journal of Medical Research* (Ind.Journ,Med.Res.), suggesting a possible discrepancy in the sources.  \n\nIn the same year, OUCHI also referenced the genus *Cryptolucilia*, indicating his engagement with related taxonomic groups. Furthermore, he is credited with describing two species in Chinese: *溪口厕蝇* (likely \"\"Xikou latrine fly\"\") and *疏斑纹蝇* (possibly \"\"Sparse-spotted muscid fly\"\"), both of which correspond to the scientific name *Musca shanghaiensis*. The Chinese term \"\"疏斑纹蝇\"\" is explicitly linked to OUCHI as its describer, while \"\"溪口厕蝇\"\" is similarly attributed to him in the data.  \n\nThe conflicting journal references for *Musca shanghaiensis*—the *Journal of the Shanghai Scientific Institute* and the *Indian Journal of Medical Research*—may stem from differing citation styles or errors in the original sources. However, all descriptions consistently attribute the 1938 publication date to OUCHI for these works. His contributions span entomological taxonomy, focusing on flies and related genera, and reflect a significant body of research from the 1930s. OUCHI’s work remains foundational in the classification of these species, with his 1938 publications serving as key references in scientific literature.  \n\nIn summary, OUCHI described *Tertiuseginia* (genus), *Syngamoptera chekiangensis*, and *Musca shanghaiensis* in 1938, with the latter species appearing in both the *Journal of the Shanghai Scientific Institute* and the *Indian Journal of Medical Research*. He also referenced *Cryptolucilia* and is associated with the Chinese species names *溪口厕蝇* and *疏斑纹蝇*.
