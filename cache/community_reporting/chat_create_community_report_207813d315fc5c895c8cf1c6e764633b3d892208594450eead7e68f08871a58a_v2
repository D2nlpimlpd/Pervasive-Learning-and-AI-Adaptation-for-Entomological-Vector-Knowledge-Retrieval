Found in Guangdong (Taishan), Malaysia (type locality), and Sri Lanka.\",7\n2527,TAISHAN,\"\n\n**TAISHAN** is a location in China that has been referenced in multiple entomological studies, though its geographical context appears to vary across reports. Primarily, it is identified as a city in **Guangdong Province**, where it serves as the **type locality** for several species within the genus *Atherigona*, including *Atherigona reversura* and *Atherigona yiwulushan*. These associations highlight its significance in the taxonomy and biodiversity of flies, particularly in the study of *Atherigona* species. However, a separate description notes a location named **Taishan** in **Shandong Province**, linked to the species *1341细角细麻蝇* (likely a Chinese name for a fly species, though the exact scientific nomenclature is unclear). This discrepancy suggests that \"\"Taishan\"\" may refer to distinct geographical sites in different provinces, or there may be an error in the data.  \n\nAdditionally, a survey on *Fannia incisurata* (a species of fly) was conducted in **Taishan**, though the specific province is not explicitly stated in this context. The survey was carried out by the **Jinzhou City Health and Epidemic Prevention Station**, which is located in **Liaoning Province**. This raises the possibility that the Taishan referenced in the survey could be a different location, potentially in Liaoning, or that the station collaborated on a study in another province. The lack of clarity in the survey’s location complicates the consolidation of Taishan’s role in entomological research.  \n\nIn summary, **Taishan** is most consistently associated with **Guangdong Province** as a type locality for *Atherigona* species and a site of ecological surveys. However, its mention in **Shandong Province** and the involvement of a **Liaoning-based institution** in a fly survey indicate either regional variations in the name \"\"Taishan\"\" or potential inconsistencies in the data. Further verification is needed to reconcile these geographical references and confirm whether multiple Taishan locations exist or if the discrepancies stem from reporting errors. The entity remains a focal point for studies on fly species, underscoring its ecological relevance in China’s biodiversity research.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",4\n2572,ATHERIGONA CRASSIBIFURCA,\"A species of fly characterized by black front tibiae (except knee area), all-black front tarsus, and a 3.5 mm body length.
