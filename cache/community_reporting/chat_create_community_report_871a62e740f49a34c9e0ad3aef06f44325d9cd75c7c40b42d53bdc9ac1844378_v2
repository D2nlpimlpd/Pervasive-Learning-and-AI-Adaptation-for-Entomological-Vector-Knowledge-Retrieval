The species is characterized by its distinct physical features, including yellow femora (the third segment of the leg), and a body length of approximately 5 millimeters. These morphological traits are critical for its identification and classification within the broader context of dipteran taxonomy. The type locality for *Dexiopsis scissura* is Jianchang, a region in the Liaoning Province of China, which serves as the primary reference location for its initial discovery and description. This geographical association highlights the species' distribution in the area, though further details about its range or habitat preferences are not explicitly provided in the descriptions. The combination of its taxonomic history, physical attributes, and regional origin establishes *Dexiopsis scissura* as a documented but relatively understudied member of the fly family, with its scientific recognition tied to Ma’s 1981 work. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, allowing for a unified summary that integrates all specified details.\",4\n2850,DEXIOPSIS FLAVIPES,\"A species of fly with darkened tibiae and a body length of 4-4.5 mm, described by Stein in 1908 and distributed in Shaanxi and Canary Islands\",3\n640,CANARY ISLANDS,\"\n\nThe Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of Africa, are a geographically and politically significant region with a diverse array of biological and taxonomic associations. As an autonomous community of Spain, they are part of the European Union but lie within the African continent’s proximity, creating a unique cross-regional identity. The islands are explicitly noted as a distribution site for multiple species, including **Sarcophaga haematodes**, **Calliphora vomitoria**, **Lispe tentaculata**, **Wohlfahrtia bella**, **Craspedochoeta liturata**, and **Caricea mikii**, highlighting their ecological role in supporting these organisms. Additionally, the archipelago serves as the type locality for **Dexiopsis scissura** and **Stomorhina lunata**, meaning these species were first described based on specimens collected there. \n\nThe Canary Islands are also linked to the genus **Helina** (specifically *Helina calceataeformis* and *Helina quadrum*), as well as **Bercaea cruentata** and **Helicophagella**, which are reported to inhabit the region. The islands are referenced in the distribution of **Egle muscaria** and **SHUANG YANGYING**, though the latter’s connection is less clearly defined in the data. Furthermore, the region is mentioned in the context of a taxonomic key for the Sarcophagini tribe, underscoring its importance in entomological classification. \n\nWhile some descriptions ambiguously categorize the Canary Islands as a \"\"foreign region\"\" in relation to species’ ranges, this likely reflects their status as an isolated archipelago rather than a contradiction. The islands’ position as a bridge between Europe and Africa contributes to their role as a biodiversity hotspot, with species such as **Craspedochoeta liturata** and **Caricea mikii** being associated with North African or broader Atlantic ecosystems. The data collectively emphasize the Canary Islands’ significance as both a biogeographic and taxonomic reference point, supporting a wide range of species and serving as the origin for scientific descriptions of others. Their inclusion in Spain’s distributional records further aligns them with European ecological frameworks, despite their geographic location. This synthesis integrates all provided details, resolving discrepancies by clarifying the islands’ political affiliation (Spain/Europe) and geographic placement (Atlantic Ocean, near Africa), while consolidating species-specific mentions into a cohesive overview.\",12\n2845,DEXIOPSIS,\"\n\n**DEXIOPSIS** is a genus of flies within the order Diptera, first established by the entomologist Pokorny in 1893. The genus is taxonomically defined by its type species, *Aricia lacteipennis*, which serves as the reference point for classifying other members of the group. Morphologically, DEXIOPSIS species are distinguished by unique bristle patterns on the thorax, a critical feature for identifying and differentiating them from related genera. Additionally, their wing venation exhibits specific structural characteristics that further support their classification within this taxonomic group. These traits—thoracic bristle arrangements and wing venation patterns—are widely recognized as diagnostic markers in entomological studies, underscoring the genus's distinct evolutionary and ecological identity. The establishment of DEXIOPSIS by Pokorny marked a significant contribution to the systematics of flies, providing a framework for understanding the diversity and relationships of species within this lineage. While the original type species remains *Aricia lacteipennis*, subsequent research may have expanded the genus to include additional species, though such details are not specified in the provided data.

The species name *lacteipennis* may refer to specific morphological features, such as pale or whitish wing markings, though this detail is not explicitly detailed in the provided descriptions. As a member of the fly order (Diptera), *Dexiopsis lacteipennis* likely exhibits typical dipteran traits, including a single pair of functional wings and a life cycle involving complete metamorphosis.
