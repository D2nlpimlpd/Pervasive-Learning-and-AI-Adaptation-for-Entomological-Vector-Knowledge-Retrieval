The region hosts a wide array of dipteran insects, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Frontina laeta*, *Helina calceataeformis* (specifically in Zhaowuda League, Chifeng), *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Muscina stabulans*, *Muscina angustifrons*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Sarcophaga variegata*, *Zenillia dolosa*, and *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *albiceps*. Tachina species such as *Tachina albidopilosa* and *Tachina nupta* are also documented there. Specific locations within Inner Mongolia, like Jining, Tumertei, Linhe, Siziwang Banner, Xilingol League, Hohhot (including Dagao Mountain and Naoxintai), Hulunbeier League, and Alashan Banner, are highlighted as key habitats for various species. For instance, *Cephalopina titillator* is found in Hohhot and Alashan Banner, while *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus* and *Oestromyia tarandi* occur in the northern Greater Khingan Range. \n\nThe region is notable for its biodiversity of genera and subgenera, including *Sarcophaga* (e.g., *KENT'S SARCOPHAGA*), *Protomiltogramma* (two species), *Strobilomyia* (e.g., *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Strobilomyia laricicola* in Ganhe and Guxuan), *Hydrophoria* (e.g., *Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*), and *Miltogramma* (*Miltogramma bimaculatum*, *Miltogramma tibitum*). Species such as *Phaenicia jagedaqiensis*, *Phaonia malaisei*, *Phaonia changbaishanensis*, and *Phaonia beizhenesis* are reported in Guyuan and other areas. The Caesar Greenbottle Fly and Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly are also present, alongside *Muscina assimilis* in Yitulihé, Tuluihé, and Genhé, and *Muscina atrifimbriae* in Jiagedaqi. \n\nInner Mongolia’s ecological diversity supports species like *Calliphora axata* (Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner, Hohhot), *Calliphora genarum* (southeastern Naoxintai), *Calliphora nigribarbis*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, and *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*. Notable distributions include *Haematobia titillans* and *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* in Alashan and Wuchuan Banner, *Paraprosalpia recta*, *Protocalliphora lii*, and *Blaesoxipha litoralis* (Keshiketeng Banner). The region is also home to *Carcelia lymantriae*, *Carcelia kockiana*, *Delia bisetosa*, *Delia sphaerobasis* (Ejina Banner), and *Delia planipalpis*. \n\nAdditional species documented in Inner Mongolia include *1238黑条蝇*, *1254钝叶污蝇*, *1256黑须污蝇*, *1281毛股折麻蝇*, *1341细角细麻蝇* (type locality), *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (Guoyuan), *731 BINGLU FLY*, *Austrophorocera*, *Azelia fengi*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Chionomyia vetula*, *Coenosia dilatitarsis*, *Dasyphora trichosterna*, *Dasyphora asiatica*, *Dasyphora albofasciata*, *Gonia bimaculata*, *Leucophora unilineata*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Macronychia griseola* and *Macronychia polyodon*, *Mydaea setifemur* and *Mydaea sinensis*, *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae*, *Peteina erinaceus*, *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Senotainia deserta*, *Apodacra pulchra*, *Servaisia rossica*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, and *Voria ruralis*.

First, Fan is cited for documenting the **domestic distribution data of *Haematobia***, a genus of flies commonly known as horn flies, within Inner Mongolia. This work provides critical insights into the geographic range and ecological presence of *Haematobia* species in the area, which is relevant for agricultural and veterinary science due to the pest's impact on livestock. Second, Fan described the species ***Strobilomyia melaniola***, a fly belonging to the family Stratiomyidae (soldier flies), and confirmed its distribution in Inner Mongolia. This taxonomic contribution highlights the region's role as a habitat for diverse and potentially understudied insect species.  \n\nInner Mongolia, a vast autonomous region in northern China characterized by its temperate climate and grassland ecosystems, serves as a significant area for entomological research. The documented presence of *Haematobia* underscores the region's importance in studying insect populations that affect local agriculture, while *Strobilomyia melaniola* adds to the catalog of native species, reflecting the area's ecological complexity. Fan's dual contributions—both in analyzing existing species' distributions and identifying new ones—demonstrate a focus on advancing knowledge of Inner Mongolia's insect fauna. These studies may inform conservation efforts, pest management strategies, and broader ecological assessments in the region.  \n\nNo contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they reference separate species and research outcomes.
