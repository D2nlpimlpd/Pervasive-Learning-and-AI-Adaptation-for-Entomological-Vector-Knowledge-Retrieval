It is explicitly noted as a domestic distribution location for the species *Limnophora fallax fallax*, indicating its role in the geographic range of this organism. Additionally, Kunming is highlighted as part of the distribution range for *Delia bracata*, further underscoring its ecological relevance for certain insect populations. The city is also referenced in the taxonomic key for *Sarcophagini*, a family of flies (Sarcophagidae), suggesting that it is a site where species within this family have been documented or studied. These descriptions collectively establish Kunming as a hub for biodiversity research, particularly in the context of insect species. While the specific species associated with the *Sarcophagini* key are not named in the provided data, the repeated emphasis on Kunming’s role in entomological taxonomy and distribution aligns with its reputation as a biologically diverse region in Yunnan. The city’s inclusion in these scientific records reflects its importance as a location for both local and regional ecological studies. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as they all consistently identify Kunming as a Yunnan, China-based entity linked to the distribution or classification of various species.
