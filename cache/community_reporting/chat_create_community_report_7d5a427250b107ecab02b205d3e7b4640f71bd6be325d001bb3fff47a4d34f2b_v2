The region is explicitly noted as part of the native range for **Exorista japonica**, a species found within its boundaries. Additionally, **1279膨端折麻蝇** (a species of fly, likely *Chrysomya pinguis* or a similar name based on the Chinese characters) is reported to occur specifically in the **northwestern part** of Northeast China, indicating a localized concentration within the broader region. **Syllegopterula**, another species, is also documented as being distributed in this area, though no further details about its specific habitats or patterns are provided. Similarly, **Blondelia nigripes** is confirmed to inhabit the Northeast region of China as part of its domestic range. Collectively, these descriptions highlight Northeast China as a significant ecological zone for the presence and diversity of these species, with some exhibiting regional specificity (e.g., 1279膨端折麻蝇 in the northwest) while others are more broadly associated with the entire area. The region’s role as a shared habitat underscores its importance in the study of these organisms’ geographic and ecological distributions.
