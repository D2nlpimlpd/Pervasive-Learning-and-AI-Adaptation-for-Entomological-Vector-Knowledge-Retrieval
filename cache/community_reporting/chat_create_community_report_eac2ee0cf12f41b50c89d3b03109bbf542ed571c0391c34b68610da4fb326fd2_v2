This area is notable for its ecological significance, as it serves as a habitat for certain species of biological interest. The **Ussuri Border** is recognized as a distribution site for the species *Robineauella scoparia*, a type of fly belonging to the family Syrphidae, which is often associated with specific environmental conditions in temperate regions. Additionally, the same region is home to the genus *Sarcorohdendorfia*, a group of organisms (likely plants or invertebrates, depending on taxonomic context) that are also documented in the USSR's Far East. While the two descriptions highlight different species or genera, they collectively underscore the **Ussuri Border** as a biologically relevant area within the Soviet Union's eastern territories, where these distinct taxa are found. The region’s ecological characteristics, such as its temperate climate and proximity to the Ussuri River, may contribute to the presence of these species, though further details on their specific roles or interactions in the ecosystem are not provided in the data. The use of \"\"Ussuri Border\"\" in both contexts appears consistent, referring to the same geographical boundary, and the summary integrates the information to reflect its association with both *Robineauella scoparia* and *Sarcorohdendorfia*. No direct contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they focus on separate taxonomic groups within the same location. The **Ussuri Border** remains a key reference point for understanding the distribution patterns of these species in the historical USSR.\",2\n4917,NORTHERN OCEANIA,Northern Oceania is a subregion of Oceania where the species Sarcorohdendorfia antilope is distributed internationally,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9229,BARANOV,SARCOROHDENDORFIA,Baranov described the genus Sarcorohdendorfia in 1938,18\n9247,USSURI BORDER,SARCOROHDENDORFIA,The genus Sarcorohdendorfia is distributed near the Ussuri border in the USSR,7\n9246,NORTHERN OCEANIA,SARCOROHDENDORFIA,The genus Sarcorohdendorfia is distributed in Northern Oceania,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
