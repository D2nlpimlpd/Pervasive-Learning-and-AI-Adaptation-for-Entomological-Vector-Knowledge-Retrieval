In 1947, James was associated with the documentation of the **Illustris Greenbottle Fly** (*Lucilia illustris*) in **New Zealand**, as well as the distribution of species in the **Oriental and Australian regions**. This work likely involved field studies or taxonomic revisions to establish or clarify geographic ranges for these species. By 1977, James expanded his contributions, being cited for detailed distribution records of multiple species, including the **Strongyloneura prasina**, a greenbottle fly species. His 1977 study also encompassed broader taxonomic analyses, suggesting a focus on classifying and mapping the geographic occurrences of various insect species. \n\nThe descriptions indicate that James’s work in 1947 centered on specific regional and species-level documentation, particularly in New Zealand and the Oriental-Australian biogeographic zones, while his 1977 efforts were more comprehensive, addressing both distribution patterns and taxonomic classifications. The mention of *Strongyloneura prasina* in 1977 highlights his role in refining data for this particular species, though it is unclear if this overlaps with the 1947 work on the Illustris Greenbottle Fly. Notably, the 1947 and 1977 citations are treated as separate contributions, implying James may have worked on different species or geographic areas in these years. \n\nDespite the temporal separation, the recurring theme in his work is the documentation of insect distribution, particularly for flies. The 1947 records emphasize the Oriental and Australian regions, whereas the 1977 study includes *Strongyloneura prasina* and potentially other species, though the latter is not explicitly named. The taxonomic aspect in 1977 suggests James also engaged in identifying or reclassifying species, adding to the scientific understanding of their morphology and relationships. \n\nIn summary, **James** is recognized as a key figure in entomology for his 1947 documentation of the Illustris Greenbottle Fly in New Zealand and the distribution of species in the Oriental and Australian regions, as well as his 1977 study on the distribution and taxonomy of *Strongyloneura prasina* and other species. His work bridges regional and taxonomic research, contributing to the foundational data of insect biodiversity in these areas. The discrepancies in time and species focus are resolved by acknowledging separate contributions in 1947 and 1977, with no direct conflict between the two.\",7\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n7718,CHRYSOMYA BEZZIANA,VILLENEUVE,Villeneuve described the species Chrysomya bezziana in 1914,24\n7715,JAMES,CHRYSOMYA BEZZIANA,James documented the species Chrysomya bezziana in the Oriental and Australian regions,17\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
