The holotype, a critical reference specimen used to define and describe the species, was gathered from this region, establishing NINGYUAN as a key geographical marker for the plant's taxonomic classification. Additionally, NINGYUAN is associated with *Bellardia menechma*, another species linked to the area, though the exact nature of this connection—whether as a collection site, habitat, or ecological context—remains unspecified in the provided data. Both *Paradichosia hunanensis* and *Bellardia menechma* are native to Hunan, and their association with NINGYUAN highlights the region's biodiversity and its role in scientific documentation. While the descriptions do not clarify if NINGYUAN is a single specific site or a broader area, the convergence of these two species' records in the same location underscores its ecological or floristic importance. Further research may be required to delineate the precise relationship between NINGYUAN and *Bellardia menechma*, but the location is definitively tied to the holotype of *Paradichosia hunanensis*, a species likely endemic to Hunan given its name.
