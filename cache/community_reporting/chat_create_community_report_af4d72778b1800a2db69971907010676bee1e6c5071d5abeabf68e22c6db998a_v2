The species was first described in the *Northeast Forestry University Journal* in 1982, in the first issue of that year, on page 9, and is accompanied by an illustration labeled Fig. 8. Additionally, the species is depicted on page 59 of the same publication, providing further visual documentation of its morphology. The original description and illustrations were authored by Fan and Ge, who established the taxonomic foundation for this species. No contradictory information is present in the provided descriptions, and the summary consolidates all details into a coherent account of the fly’s physical attributes, geographic distribution, and taxonomic history.\",5\n568,NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIVERSITY JOURNAL,\"\n\nThe **Northeast Forestry University Journal** is an academic publication associated with Northeast Forestry University, known for contributing to entomological research through the documentation of insect species. In 1982, the journal featured multiple studies on distinct species, highlighting its role as a platform for scientific discoveries in the field. Specifically, it published research on **Strobilomyia melaniola**, conducted by an author named Fan, as well as descriptions of two other species: **Lasiomma divergens** and **Lasiomma graciliapicum**. The description of *Lasiomma divergens* appeared in the first issue of 1982 (1982(1):9), accompanied by a figure (Fig. 7), while *Lasiomma graciliapicum* was also documented in the same year, though without specifying the exact issue. These entries collectively underscore the journal’s focus on taxonomic and ecological studies of insects, particularly within the context of forestry and related disciplines. The 1982 publications reflect the journal’s commitment to advancing knowledge of biodiversity, with contributions from researchers such as Fan and others who described new or notable species. While the descriptions of *Lasiomma divergens* and *Lasiomma graciliapicum* are attributed to the journal itself, the involvement of Fan in the study of *Strobilomyia melaniola* indicates individual scholarly contributions alongside institutional efforts. The journal’s inclusion of detailed figures, such as Fig. 7 for *Lasiomma divergens*, further emphasizes its dedication to providing visual and empirical support for taxonomic classifications. These works from 1982 demonstrate the journal’s historical significance in entomology, particularly in documenting species within the genera *Strobilomyia* and *Lasiomma*. The absence of conflicting information in the provided descriptions allows for a unified summary, affirming the journal’s role in publishing diverse research on insect species during that year. Its contributions to the scientific community, as evidenced by these studies, align with the broader mission of Northeast Forestry University to promote interdisciplinary research in natural sciences. The journal remains a notable source for historical entomological data, with its 1982 publications serving as early references for these species.\",3\n598,DIEBU,,2\n589,MUDANJING DONGCUN FORESTRY FARM,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n507,LASIOMMA DIVERGENS,FAN,Lasiomma divergens was described by Fan in 1982,300\n545,LASIOMMA GRACILIAPICUM,GE,Lasiomma graciliapicum was described by Ge in 1982,18\n513,NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIVERSITY JOURNAL,LASIOMMA GRACILIAPICUM,\"\n\nThe **Northeast Forestry University Journal**, a publication associated with **Northeast Forestry University**, documented the species **Lasiomma graciliapicum** in 1982.
