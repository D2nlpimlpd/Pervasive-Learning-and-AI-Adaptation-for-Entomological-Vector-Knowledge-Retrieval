CHEN's work spans multiple genera, including *Dinemomyia*, *Bellardia*, *Polleniopsis*, *Enneastigma*, *Paradichosia*, and *Alliopsis*, with collaborations involving researchers such as Fan, Yao, and others. In 1975, CHEN established the genus *Dinemomyia* and described its type species, *Dinemomyia nigribasicosta*. Earlier, in 1979, CHEN authored *Bellardia menechmoides* and *Onesia variola*, and by 1983, expanded the *Bellardia* genus by describing *Bellardia xinganensis* as well as additional species like Qinghai *Bellardia*, Fengcheng *Bellardia*, Chosen *Bellardia*, and Menechmoides *Bellardia*. \n\nCHEN's collaborations with Fan are notable, particularly in the 1980s. Together, they described *Enneastigma shanghaiensis* and *Enneastigma pilosiventrosa*, as well as *E. labradorensis* in 1980. In 1980, CHEN and Fan also co-authored the description of *曲叶近脉花蝇* (a species name in Chinese, likely *Pierretia recurvata*). By 1982, CHEN contributed to the description of *Delia gracilibacilla* and the 1337耳阳细麻蝇 species. In 1983, CHEN and Fan co-authored *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae* and *Paraprosalpia conifrons changbaiensis*, and CHEN independently described *Delia jilinensis*. The same year, CHEN co-established the genus *Alliopsis* with Fan. \n\nCHEN's work on the *Polleniopsis* genus is extensive, including the 1988 description of *Polleniopsis yunnanensis* and *Polleniopsis varilata*, as well as *Polleniopsis deqingensis* and *Polleniopsis milina*. In 1991, CHEN co-authored *Polleniopsis cuonaensis*. Additionally, CHEN co-described *Pegomya aurivillosa* in 1984 and *Pierretia (s.str.) recurvata* in 1986 with Yao. In 1990, CHEN collaborated on the description of *Limnophora brunneisquama*. \n\nBeyond species-level work, CHEN is associated with the subgenus *Hamimembrana* and broader taxonomic classifications. CHEN also co-authored the 1981 description of the genus *Alisarcophaga*. Notably, CHEN's contributions to *Paradichosia* include co-describing *blaesostyla*, *brachyphalla*, and *kangdingensis*. The researcher's work with Fan further extended to *Monochrotogaster rufifrons* in 1982 and *Engyneura curvostylata* in 1980. \n\nCHEN's career reflects a focus on dipteran taxonomy, with a particular emphasis on genera such as *Dinemomyia*, *Bellardia*, and *Polleniopsis*. Collaborations with Fan and Yao highlight partnerships in advancing the understanding of these groups, while independent work on species like *Delia gracilibacilla* and *Onesia variola* underscores CHEN's individual expertise.
