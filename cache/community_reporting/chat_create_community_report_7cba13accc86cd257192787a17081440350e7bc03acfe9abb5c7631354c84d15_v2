They are cited in entomological literature as an author who described multiple species, including *Isomyia pseudoviridana* in 1952. In the same year, PERIS completed the classification work for a genus, though the specific genus is not explicitly named in the data. Additionally, they served as a co-author for the genus *Idiella* in 1952, indicating collaboration in taxonomic studies. PERIS also documented the distribution of two species, *Rhinia apicalis* in 1952 and *Stomorhina lunata* in 1956, contributing to geographic and ecological records. Their work spans at least three years (1952, 1956, and another 1952 reference, likely a duplicate), with a focus on species-level descriptions and broader taxonomic classifications. While the data does not specify the exact genera or families involved beyond *Isomyia*, *Idiella*, *Rhinia*, and *Stomorhina*, it highlights PERIS’s role in advancing entomological knowledge through detailed species accounts, collaborative genus-level research, and distributional studies. The repeated emphasis on 1952 suggests this was a particularly productive year for their taxonomic work, encompassing both standalone species descriptions and collaborative projects. PERIS’s studies on *Rhinia apicalis* and *Stomorhina lunata* further demonstrate their engagement with documenting geographic ranges, which is critical for understanding biodiversity and ecological dynamics. Overall, PERIS’s contributions reflect a multidisciplinary approach to entomology, combining systematic classification, species discovery, and ecological documentation. Their work remains foundational in the field, providing essential references for subsequent research on these taxa. The data does not clarify whether PERIS’s studies on \"\"the species\"\" in 1952, 1956, and 1952 (the latter likely a typographical repetition) refer to the same or different species, but it underscores their sustained activity in entomological research during this period. By integrating authorship of species, genus-level classifications, and distributional records, PERIS’s legacy is marked by a commitment to both taxonomic precision and ecological insight. Their 1952 publications, in particular, appear to be pivotal, as they include the description of *Isomyia pseudoviridana*, the completion of a genus classification, and co-authorship of *Idiella*, alongside earlier work on *Rhinia apicalis*. The 1956 study on *Stomorhina lunata* adds a later contribution to their portfolio, emphasizing their long-term involvement in the field. PERIS’s efforts exemplify the collaborative and cumulative nature of entomological science, where individual contributions often form part of larger taxonomic frameworks. Despite the lack of additional biographical details, their documented works establish PERIS as a key figure in mid-20th-century entomology, with a focus on dipteran or related insect groups, given the species names provided. The synthesis of these activities into a cohesive body of work highlights their role in expanding the taxonomic database and supporting ecological research through meticulous documentation.\",15\n4335,ISOMYIA PSEUDOVIRIDANA,\"A species of fly described by Peris in 1952, with a body length of 6.5 mm, distributed in Anhui, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Hainan, and internationally in Myanmar, Nepal, India, and Sri Lanka\",3\n4282,ANN.

It is a region where Neomyia species, a genus of flies, are found, as noted in one of the descriptions. Additionally, Sikkim is described as a location where \"\"the species\"\" (likely referring to Neomyia or other unspecified organisms) are present. However, a contradiction arises in the data: one description incorrectly identifies Sikkim as a \"\"country,\"\" while the others correctly classify it as an \"\"Indian state\"\" and a \"\"region.\"\" This discrepancy is resolved by confirming Sikkim’s status as a state within the Republic of India, not an independent country. \n\nThe state is characterized by its mountainous terrain, alpine forests, and trans-Himalayan ecosystems, which contribute to its role as a biodiversity hotspot. Its geographical position, bordering China, Nepal, and Bhutan, enhances its ecological significance. The presence of Neomyia species in Sikkim aligns with its rich natural environments, which support a variety of flora and fauna. While the term \"\"species\"\" in the first description is vague, the third provides specificity by naming Neomyia, a genus of flies often associated with moist, temperate habitats. \n\nIn summary, Sikkim is an Indian state in the northeastern Himalayas that serves as a habitat for Neomyia species and other biodiversity. The conflicting reference to it being a \"\"country\"\" is corrected to reflect its accurate administrative classification as a state within India. Its ecosystems, shaped by high-altitude geography and regional climate, make it a critical area for the study and conservation of such species.\",2\n4186,1952 STUDY,The 1952 study by Peris on the species distribution,2\n4336,AN.
