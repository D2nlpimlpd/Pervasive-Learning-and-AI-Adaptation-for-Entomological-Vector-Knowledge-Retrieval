Additionally, **1256黑须污蝇** (a Chinese species name) and **圆斑莠蝇** (another Chinese species name) are noted as part of its fauna.  \n\nBeijing is further associated with the **genera** *Kramerea* (*Kramerea schuetzei*), *Bessa*, *Hyleorus elatus*, and *Bellardia* (*Bellardia benshiensis*, *Bellardia menechma*). The **Blue-Black栉寄蝇** (*Pales pavida*) and **Charcoal-Black栉寄蝇** (*Pales carbonata*) are specifically mentioned as distributed in the city. It is also a domestic region for **Delia antiqua**, **Craspedoeta species**, **Polleniopsis mongolica**, **Lasiomma anthomyinum**, **Musca tempestiva**, and **Calythea nigricans**.  \n\nDespite some descriptions ambiguously referring to Beijing as a \"\"province\"\" or part of **Hebei province**, the correct administrative classification is as a **municipality**. The city’s ecological diversity supports both native and potentially invasive species, such as **Musca bezzii** and **Musca conducens**, while its status as a type locality underscores its importance in entomological taxonomy. Overall, Beijing functions as a shared distribution location for multiple fly species, reflecting its role as a key geographical and ecological reference point in China.  \n\n(Word count: 299)\",97\n5484,1430筒须新怯寄蝇,,5\n5534,MEDINA COLLARIS,\"Medina collaris is a species within the Medina genus, described by Fallen in 1820.

Notably, he is recognized as a collector who documented the species *Heteronychia quoi*, contributing to the understanding of its distribution or characteristics in the region. Additionally, Wang Shuyong is linked to the study of *Meigenia grandigena*, another entomological subject, further highlighting his involvement in documenting or analyzing insect biodiversity in Beijing. While the descriptions do not specify the exact nature of his role in the study of *Meigenia grandigena* (e.g., whether he conducted fieldwork, taxonomic analysis, or collaborative research), they collectively establish his engagement with entomological work in the area. The lack of direct contradiction between the two descriptions allows for a unified summary, emphasizing his contributions to the documentation of at least two distinct species within the same geographic context. His activities likely support broader scientific efforts to catalog and understand insect populations in Beijing, though further details about his methodologies, affiliations, or the scope of his research remain unspecified in the provided data.\",3\n5536,ZHOU SHIXIU,Zhou Shixiu is an individual associated with the study of Meigenia grandigena in Beijing.,2\n4099,STEJN,Stejn is a researcher associated with the subspecies Passer montanus saturatue in Beijing,1\n1505,PEGOMYA ORIENTIS,\"Fly species described by Suwa in 1974, found in Shanghai and Zhejiang\",4\n5485,1431家蚕追寄蝇,,18\n5507,TACHINA NOCTUARUM,A species of fly described by Rondani in 1865,11\n1066,LEUCOPHORA UNILINEATA,\"Leucophora unilineata is a species of fly described by Zetterstedt in 1920, characterized by specific morphological features such as wing bristles and body length of 6-7 mm\",7\n1464,PEGOMYA CUNICULARIA,\"A species of Pegomya fly in the Pegomya hyoscyami group with no pre-dorsal bristles on the fore tibia, yellow or brownish lower mouthparts, and dark-tipped antennae.

It serves as a domestic distribution location for numerous insect species, including both flies and parasitic wasps. Among the notable species recorded in Guangxi are *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca convexifrons* (found in Guilin and Yushan), and *Musca crassirostris* (with records in Guilin Yanshan and Yangshuo). The region is also home to *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Argyrophylax phoeda*, *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*, and *Carcelia matsukarehae*, *Carcelia ambigua*, *Carcelia lymantriae*, as well as *Carcelia kockiana*. \n\nGuangxi hosts several species of the genus *Parasarcophaga*, including *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Parasarcophaga idmais*, *Parasarcophaga hui*, and *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*. Additionally, the region is a habitat for *Servillia planiforceps*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Heteronychia quoi*, *Bengalia* species, *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, *Dichaetomyia* species, *Lispe loewi*, *Stomorhina obsoleta*, *Austrophorocera*, *Caiusa coomani*, *Nemoraea pellucida*, *Cuphocera varia*, *Miltogramma iberium*, *Dolichocolon klapperichi*, and *Anthomyia illocata*. Specific localities within Guangxi, such as Nanning and Wuzhou, are highlighted for the presence of *Chrysomya pinguis*, *Chrysomya megacephala*, and *Chrysomya bezziana*. \n\nThe region is further associated with the distribution of *Stomoxys sitiens*, *Medina collaris*, *Gonia chinensis*, *Neomyia* species, *Vibrissina Rondani* genus, *Bessa* genus, *Achoetandrus rufifacies* (at Guilin Yanshan), *Hemipyrellia liguriens* (in Yangshuo), and *Actia nigroscutellata*. Chinese names for species include 紫翠蝇 (a species of fly), 翼阳细麻蝇, 1430筒须新怯寄蝇, and 1393义乌亚麻蝇, 1399胡氏亚麻蝇, alongside the genus *Hengda Jiewei Jiying* (recorded in Longsheng) and *Sisyropa prominens* (also found with *Drino inconspicua*). \n\nGuangxi’s biodiversity is underscored by its inclusion of *Lydella grisescens*, *I. euidielloides*, and *Lydella* species, as well as the genus *Lydella* and *Miltogramma iberium*. The region’s cities, such as Baise, Chongzuo, and Lingye, are noted for their ecological significance in supporting these species. While some descriptions refer to Guangxi as a \"\"province,\"\" it is technically an autonomous region within China, a distinction that aligns with its administrative classification. The data collectively emphasize Guangxi as a critical area for the study and conservation of various fly and parasitic wasp species, with specific localities and genera contributing to its entomological importance. This summary integrates all provided descriptions, resolving minor terminological variations (e.g., \"\"province\"\" vs. \"\"autonomous region\"\") to reflect Guangxi’s accurate status while consolidating species mentions for clarity.\",59\n2372,NEOMYIA (ORTHELLIA) RUFIFACIES,,4\n2097,BAISE,\"Baise is a city in Guangxi province, China\",1\n3798,ONESIA VARIOLA,\"A species of fly described by Chen in 1979, characterized by specific morphological features such as wing coloration and abdominal patterns, found in China's domestic regions like Liaoning, Beijing, and Hebei\",5\n5502,EXORISTA FASCIAATA,\"Exorista fasciata is a species of fly characterized by underdeveloped frontostigmal bristles, grayish-white powder on the frons, and similar-sized hairs on the frons and cheeks.
