He is credited with describing multiple genera within the Diptera order, including *Hydrotaea*, *Ophyra*, and *Xestomyia*, which are now foundational in the study of fly taxonomy. In 1830, Robineau-Desvoidy formally described the genus *Tachina*, a group of robber flies, and also documented the species *Neomyia indica*, commonly known as the Indian greenbottle fly, which is native to South Asia. His work on *Neomyia indica* provided early taxonomic clarity for this blow fly, which is ecologically and economically relevant due to its role in decomposition and potential pest status. While the descriptions highlight his role in defining both genera and species, there is no contradiction in the data, as *Tachina* refers to a genus and *Neomyia indica* to a specific species. Robineau-Desvoidy’s efforts in the 19th century advanced the understanding of fly biodiversity, particularly in regions like India, and his classifications remain referenced in modern entomological literature. His legacy is preserved through the scientific names he assigned, which continue to be used in taxonomic studies and ecological research.
