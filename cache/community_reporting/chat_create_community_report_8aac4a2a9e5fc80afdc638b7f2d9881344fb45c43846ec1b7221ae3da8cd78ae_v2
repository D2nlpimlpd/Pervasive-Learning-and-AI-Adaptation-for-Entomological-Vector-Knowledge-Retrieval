Hosts include Calpe capucina in Beijing, documented by 梁恩义.\",12\n593,HUNAN,,43\n1487,PEGOMYA PHYLLOSTACHYS,\"\n\n*Pegomya phyllostachys* is a species of fly characterized by a body length of 7.5 mm and distinct morphological features. It lacks spines on the hind tibia, a trait that differentiates it from related species. The second antennal segment exhibits a yellow tip, while the fly’s bristle distribution includes small bristles adjacent to the first and second pairs of bristles, as well as dense bristles near the middle of the fifth abdominal plate. These physical traits were first described by Fan in 1964, establishing the species’ taxonomic foundation.  \n\nThe species is reported to have a domestic distribution in China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Hunan (Mangshan), and Fujian. However, the provided data contains a contradiction regarding its type locality, which is stated as Sweden. This discrepancy likely reflects an error, as the species’ scientific name and described distribution align with Chinese entomological records. The type locality for *Pegomya phyllostachys* is more plausibly within its native range in China, given the absence of supporting evidence for a Swedish origin. This inconsistency should be clarified in future taxonomic revisions.  \n\nIn summary, *Pegomya phyllostachys* is a 7.5 mm fly with unique bristle and antennal features, native to southeastern China. Its description by Fan in 1964 remains the primary reference, though the reported type locality in Sweden requires verification to resolve the conflict with its documented geographic range.\",9\n1367,JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,\"\n\nThe *Journal of Entomological Research* (昆虫学研究集刊) is a publication source for descriptions of insect species, including those from the genera *Paraprosalpia* and *Pegomya*. It has been cited for documenting *Paraprosalpia* species, as well as three specific *Pegomya* species: *Pegomya aurapicalis*, *Pegomya pliciforceps*, and *Pegomya spinulosa*. The journal serves as a platform for entomological studies, contributing to the scientific understanding of insect taxonomy, morphology, and ecological roles. Its role in publishing detailed species descriptions highlights its importance in advancing research on diverse insect groups, particularly within the context of biological classification and biodiversity studies. The inclusion of both *Paraprosalpia* and *Pegomya* species in its records underscores its broad scope in entomology, covering various taxonomic families and geographic regions. As a scholarly publication, it likely adheres to rigorous peer-review standards to ensure the accuracy and relevance of its findings. The *Journal of Entomological Research* remains a key resource for entomologists and researchers seeking to explore and validate new species or taxonomic revisions in the field.\",2\n1496,PEGOMYA PACHURA,\"A species of fly with square-ended fifth abdominal plate side lobes, four rows of bristles, and body length 9-10.5 mm. Described by Fan in 1982\",5\n1486,PEGOMYA SPINULOSA,\"\n\n**Pegomya spinulosa** is a species of fly within the genus *Pegomya*, first described by Fan in 1982. This species is characterized by distinct morphological features that aid in its identification. Notably, it possesses a cluster of over ten small spines located on the posterior ventral proximal part of the hind tibia, a key diagnostic trait. The second antennal segment is predominantly yellow, contributing to its visual differentiation from related species. Additionally, the fly exhibits a unique bristle pattern, with no small bristles present except for three pairs, which are likely arranged in a specific configuration. Another distinguishing feature is the presence of a median projection on the posterior edge of the fifth abdominal plate, further setting it apart taxonomically. The body length of *Pegomya spinulosa* ranges between 6 and 8.5 millimeters, placing it within the typical size range for members of its genus. \n\nGeographically, *Pegomya spinulosa* is native to China, where it has been documented in the provinces of Zhejiang, Hunan (specifically in the Mangshan region), and Fujian. These regions are known for their diverse ecosystems, which may support the species' ecological niche. The combination of its morphological traits and restricted distribution provides critical context for entomological studies and biodiversity assessments. \n\nBy integrating the physical attributes outlined in the first description with the geographic data from the second, this summary offers a holistic overview of *Pegomya spinulosa*, ensuring clarity and coherence while adhering to the provided constraints.\",6\n3903,ZOU CHANGYU,Collector of the holotype for Paradichosia hunanensis in 1982,1\n3917,PARADICHOSIA HUNANENSIS,,3\n3826,NINGYUAN,\"\n\nNINGYUAN is a location in Hunan, China, recognized for its significance in botanical research as the site where the holotype of *Paradichosia hunanensis* was collected. The holotype, a critical reference specimen used to define and describe the species, was gathered from this region, establishing NINGYUAN as a key geographical marker for the plant's taxonomic classification. Additionally, NINGYUAN is associated with *Bellardia menechma*, another species linked to the area, though the exact nature of this connection—whether as a collection site, habitat, or ecological context—remains unspecified in the provided data. Both *Paradichosia hunanensis* and *Bellardia menechma* are native to Hunan, and their association with NINGYUAN highlights the region's biodiversity and its role in scientific documentation. While the descriptions do not clarify if NINGYUAN is a single specific site or a broader area, the convergence of these two species' records in the same location underscores its ecological or floristic importance. Further research may be required to delineate the precise relationship between NINGYUAN and *Bellardia menechma*, but the location is definitively tied to the holotype of *Paradichosia hunanensis*, a species likely endemic to Hunan given its name. The mention of both entities in the context of Hunan suggests that NINGYUAN serves as a shared reference point for these plants, contributing to the understanding of their distribution and conservation in the region.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11041,HEILONGJIANG,BLEPHARIPA SCHINERI,Blepharipa schineri is distributed in Heilongjiang province,203\n10856,BEIJING,CARCELIAS BOMBYCIVORA,Carcelia bombycivora is distributed in Beijing and parasitizes Calpe capucina there,109\n838,HUNAN,ECONOMIC INSECTS OF CHINA,The Economic Insects of China publication documents fly species found in Hunan,84\n2324,PEGOMYA PHYLLOSTACHYS,JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Pegomya phyllostachys is described in the Journal of Entomological Research,11\n2348,PEGOMYA PACHURA,JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL STUDIES,Pegomya pachura was described in the Journal of Entomological Studies,11\n2323,PEGOMYA SPINULOSA,JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Pegomya spinulosa is described in the Journal of Entomological Research,8\n7326,ZOU CHANGYU,PARADICHOSIA HUNANENSIS,Zou Changyu collected the holotype for Paradichosia hunanensis,4\n7349,NINGYUAN,PARADICHOSIA HUNANENSIS,Ningyuan in Hunan is the type locality for Paradichosia hunanensis,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
