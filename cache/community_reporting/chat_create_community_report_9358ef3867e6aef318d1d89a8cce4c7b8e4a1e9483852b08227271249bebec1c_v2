It holds ecological and taxonomic significance as a key site for entomological research. Specifically, Qianshan is recognized as the type locality for *Phaonia angustiprosternum*, a species in the fly family Muscidae, which means it is the geographic location where this species was first formally described and documented. Additionally, the mountain is associated with the distribution of *Megophyra* species, a genus within the hoverfly family Syrphidae, highlighting its role as a habitat or ecological reference point for these insects. \n\nThe connection to *Phaonia angustiprosternum* underscores Qianshan's importance in the study of dipteran taxonomy, as type localities are critical for defining and validating species classifications. Meanwhile, the presence of *Megophyra* species in the region suggests that Qianshan's environment supports biodiversity relevant to syrphid flies, which are often studied for their ecological roles as pollinators and indicators of ecosystem health. While the two descriptions focus on different insect groups, they collectively emphasize Qianshan's value as a site for scientific investigation into arthropod diversity and biogeography. \n\nGeographically, Qianshan is part of the broader landscape of Liaoning Province, an area known for its rich fossil deposits and diverse ecosystems. The mountain's specific location in Anshan may contribute to unique microhabitats that facilitate the presence of these species. However, the descriptions provided do not clarify whether the *Megophyra* species are endemic to Qianshan or merely part of a wider regional distribution. Further research would be needed to determine the extent of the mountain's influence on these taxa. \n\nIn summary, Qianshan in Anshan, Liaoning, China, serves as both a type locality for *Phaonia angustiprosternum* and a site linked to *Megophyra* species distribution, reflecting its dual role in entomological science as a reference point for taxonomic work and a habitat for ecologically significant insects. These associations highlight the mountain's contribution to understanding the biodiversity and evolutionary history of dipteran species in the region. \n\n(Word count: 200)\",1\n1904,DRYMEIA GRAPSOPODA,,2\n1905,CAO,,10\n3425,PHAOINIA DISMAGNICONDIS,\"Fly species described in 1989 by Xue and Cao with type locality in Taibai Mountain, Shaanxi\",5\n2598,TAIBAI MOUNTAIN,\"\n\n**TAIBAI MOUNTAIN** is a prominent geographical entity located in Shaanxi Province, China.
