The province also hosts species such as *Adia danieli* (genus *Adia*), *Phaonia incana*, *Phaonia errans*, *Phaonia hamiloba*, *Phaonia tenuirostris*, *Phaonia rufitarsis*, *Phaonia decussata*, *Phaonia suspiciosa*, and *Phaonia vidua*, *Phaonia nudiseta*, *Phaonia subfausta*. \n\nQinghai is notable for its role as a type locality for several species, including *Hydrotaea spinosa* and *Hydrotaea nudispinosa* (Menyuan), *Limnophora orbitalis* (Chaidamu), and *Scathophaga amplipennis* (type locality). Specific locations within the province, such as **Yushu**, **Zeku**, **Menyuan**, **Huangyuan**, **Dulan**, **East Qilian Mountains**, and **Chaidamu**, are frequently cited as habitats for these insects. For example, *Calliphora chinghaiensis* and *Helina truncata* are documented in Yushu, while *Coenosia dilatitarsis* is associated with Chaidamu as its type locality. \n\nThe province supports a wide array of **Delia** species, including *Delia canalis*, *Delia felsicanalis*, *Delia angustissima*, *Delia brassicaeformis*, *Delia subnigribasis*, *Delia nigribasis*, and *Delia coarctata* (found in Huangyuan, Qilian, and Zhumu). **Pegomya** species like *Pegomya aurivillosa*, *Pegomya flavoscutellata*, *Pegomya betae*, *Pegomya melatrochanter*, and *Pegomya esuriens* are also present. Additionally, Qinghai is a key region for **Pegohylemyia** (e.g., *Pegohylemyia pulvineta*, *Pegohylemyia latirufifrons*), **Hydrophoria** (e.g., *Hydrophoria melaena*), **Hylemya** (*Hylemya bruneipalpis*, *Hylemya nigrimana*), **Lydella**, **Lispe** (*Lispe cinifera*), **Paraprosalpia** (*Paraprosalpia magnilamella*, *Paraprosalpia pilitarsis*, *Paraprosalpia dasyops* in Nangqian), and **Gonia** (*Gonia klapperichi*, *Gonia bimaculata* in Yushu). \n\nOther documented species include *Calliphora rohdendorfi*, *Calythea xizangensis* (Nangqian), *Chaetogena gynacphorae*, *Helina brunneipalpis*, *Linnaemya* spp., *Polietes nigrolimbata*, *I. tripartita*, *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Onesiomima pamirica*, *Blondelia nigripes*, *Subhylemyia longula*, *Leucophora grisella*, *Leucophora sericea*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, *Morellia hortorum tibetana*, *Musca domestica*, and the Chinese *731 BINGLU FLY*.
