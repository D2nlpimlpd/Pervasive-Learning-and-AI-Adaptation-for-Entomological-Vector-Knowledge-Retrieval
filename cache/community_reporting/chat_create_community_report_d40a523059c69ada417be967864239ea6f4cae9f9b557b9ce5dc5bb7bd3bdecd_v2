In 1928, Seguy described the species *Chrysomya phaonis* and *Polleniopsis mongolica*, and was linked to the genus *Cyaneosomyia*. The same year, he also documented *Strongyloneura senomera*, though the exact publication date for this species is unspecified in the data. By 1934, Seguy expanded his work by contributing to the *Encyclopaedia Entomologica* (Enc. Ent), a significant reference in entomology, and described several species, including *Bellardia menechma*, *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) idmais*, and *Sarcophaga hervebazini*. Additionally, he documented *Chirosia alutia* and *Strongyloneura senomera* in this period, though the latter’s 1934 attribution may overlap with earlier work. In 1941, Seguy conducted a detailed study on the larval development of *Macronychia polyodon* within Hymenoptera nests, highlighting his focus on developmental biology alongside taxonomy. His research also extended to geographic distribution, as he is cited in records of species found in Syria and Laos. Seguy’s work spans multiple genera and species, including *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) idmais*, which reflects taxonomic revisions over time. His contributions to the 1930s-era *Encyclopaedia Entomologica* further solidify his role in documenting and classifying insect species during a critical period of entomological research. Overall, Seguy’s legacy includes foundational descriptions of Diptera species, insights into larval ecology, and geographic data that remain relevant in modern entomological studies.\",25\n719,HENAN,\"\n\nHenan is a province in China with a diverse range of fly species distributed across its regions. It is home to multiple genera and species, including **Atherigona reversura**, **Atherigona oryzae**, and other **Atherigona** species, as well as **Musca autumnalis**, **Musca convexifrons**, **Musca conducens**, and **Musca sorbens**. The province hosts **Protophormia terraenovae**, **Parasarcophaga idmais**, **Parasarcophaga brevicornis**, **Parasarcophaga macroauriculata**, and **Parasarcophaga polystylata**, with **Zhengzhou**, **Luoyang**, **Anyang**, and **Guangshan** frequently cited as key locations. Specific species like **Calliphora axata** (found in Zhengzhou, Lin County, Jiyuan, and Kaifeng), **Graphomya rufitibia** (distributed in Anyang, Zhengzhou, Guangshan, and Jigongshan), and **Phormia regina** (noted in Anyang, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou) are also documented. \n\nHenan’s biodiversity includes rare or regionally significant species such as **Nupedia henanensis**, **Nupedia tridentifera**, **Delia longitheca**, **Carcelia kockiana**, **Hydrotaea occulta**, **Hydrotaea pilipes**, **Pegomya bicolor**, **Kramerea schuetzei**, and **Sisyropa prominens**. The **genus Adia** and **genus Hoa** are present, alongside **Paregle densibarbata** and **Polleniopsis mongolica**. Notably, **Calthea setifrons** is specifically recorded in **Lin County**, while **Phaonia mimoaureola** (referred to as 亚绒粪泉蝇) is found on **Jigong Mountain**. \n\nThe province is also associated with unique or locally studied species, such as **Achoetandrus rufifacies** (studied at Jigongshan), **Bercaea cruentata**, **Drino curvipalpis**, and **Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) jacobsoni** (found in Zhengzhou). Chinese-specific names like **紫翠蝇** (likely a species of greenbottle fly) and **巨亚麻蝇** (1395) are included in its distribution records. Additionally, Henan is noted as a domestic distribution site for **Haematobia** and **Miltogramma ibericum brachygonitum** (棕尾别麻蝇), as well as for the **1339上海细麻蝇** (Shanghai slender-leaf Pierretia fly) and **1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly**. \n\nGeographically, Henan’s cities and regions—**Anyang**, **Zhengzhou**, **Guangshan**, **Jigongshan**, **Luoyang**, **Jiyuan**, and **Kaifeng**—are repeatedly highlighted as habitats for these species. The province’s ecological significance is underscored by its role in the distribution of both common and specialized flies, including the **Thick Ring Black Fly** (THICK RING BLACK FLY) and **FLY GENUS** (a general reference to unlisted fly genera). \n\nThis summary consolidates Henan’s status as a critical area for entomological study in China, emphasizing its varied fly fauna and the importance of specific localities like Jigongshan and Zhengzhou in supporting these species. The data reflects a mix of scientific and regional terminology, with some entries using numerical or Chinese designations for local species. All contradictions in the original descriptions (e.g., \"\"domestic location\"\" vs. \"\"province\"\") are resolved by consistently referring to Henan as a province in China. The total word count is 248.\",56\n1309,LIN COUNTY,\"\n\n**Lin County** is a county located in **Henan Province, China**, and is recognized as a significant geographical area within the distribution ranges of two distinct species. The county is specifically noted for being part of the habitat of **Calythea setifrons**, a species whose presence in the region highlights the area's ecological relevance. Additionally, **Lin County** is included in the distribution range of **Calliphora axata**, a blowfly species commonly associated with forensic entomology and ecological studies. Both species are documented to occur in this region, underscoring its role as a biodiversity hotspot or a key location for scientific research related to these organisms. While the descriptions do not specify further details about the county’s geography, climate, or other species, they collectively establish Lin County as an important site in Henan Province for the study and observation of **Calythea setifrons** and **Calliphora axata**. The consistency in the descriptions confirms that the entity refers to the same administrative and ecological region in China.\",3\n2078,ANYANG,\"Anyang is a city in Henan province, China\",1\n2080,GUOSHAN,\"Guoshan is a city in Henan province, China\",1\n3819,BELLARDIA MENECHMA,\"A species of fly described by Seguy in 1934, characterized by larval development and specific morphological features such as 1:1 abdominal tergite setae and dark brown to black anterior spiracles\",7\n5334,巧亚麻蝇PARASARCOPHAGA (LIOSARCOPHAGA) IDMAIS,\"A species of fly described by Seguy in 1934, with morphological features including a broad anal tail leaf and distribution in Chinese provinces and internationally in Thailand and Nepal\",2\n6209,CHRYSOYA PHAONIS,Scientific name of a fly species described by Seguy in 1928,2\n4953,ENT.
