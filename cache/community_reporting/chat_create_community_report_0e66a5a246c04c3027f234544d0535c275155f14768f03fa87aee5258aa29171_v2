It was first described by the entomologist Fan in 1988, as documented in taxonomic literature. The species is native to China, with specific records indicating its presence in Zhejiang Province, a region in eastern China known for its diverse ecosystems. While one description refers to it as a \"\"species of Eutrichota,\"\" the other broadly identifies it as a \"\"species of fly,\"\" both align in confirming its classification within the fly order Diptera and its association with the genus *Eutrichota*. The genus *Eutrichota* is characterized by its parasitoid lifestyle, as many of its members are known to lay eggs on or in host insects, particularly caterpillars. *Eutrichota gigas* likely shares these ecological traits, though specific details about its behavior, host preferences, or life cycle are not provided in the given data. The species’ discovery in Zhejiang Province highlights the region’s significance as a biodiversity hotspot for tachinid flies, which play critical roles in natural pest control. No contradictions exist in the provided descriptions, as both confirm the species’ taxonomic placement and geographic origin.

The province hosts a wide array of dipteran genera and species, many of which are associated with specific localities such as Tianmu Mountain, Hangzhou, Fuyang, Zhoushan, Yiwu, Beiyandangshan, and Moganshan. These regions serve as key distribution sites and type localities for various taxa, reflecting Zhejiang’s ecological importance in entomological studies.  \n\nZhejiang is home to multiple genera and species of flies, including **Atherigona** (*A. reversura*, *A. triglomerata*), **Eutrichota** (*E. gigas*, type locality at Tianmu Mountain), **Musca** (*M. autumnalis*, *M. convexifrons*, *M. conducens*, *M. sorbens*), and **Thecocarcelia** (*T. parnarae*, *T. laticornis*). The province also supports **Argyrophylax** (*A. phoeda*, *A. nigrotibialis*), **Parasarcophaga** (*P. albiceps*, *P. brevicornis*, *P. macroauriculata*, *P. polystylata*, *P. idmais*), and **Tachina** (*T. nupta*, *T. noctuarum*), alongside **Servillia ardens** and **Exorista jugoslavica**. Notably, **Syngamoptera chekiangensis** is endemic to Zhejiang, with Tianmu Mountain as its type locality, and the province is also a distribution site for **1430筒须新怯寄蝇** and **1431家蚕追寄蝇**.  \n\nThe region is a critical habitat for **Gonia** species (*G. klapperichi*, *G. chinensis*, *G. bimaculata*), **Carcelia** (*C. matsukarehae*, *C. ambigua*, *C. kockiana*), and **Sarcophaga** (including *S. polystylata* and *S. macroauriculata*). **Pegomya** is well-represented, with *P. spinulosa*, *P. phyllostachys*, *P. pachura*, *P. clavellata*, *P. lyrura*, and *P. japonica mokanensis* documented. **Graphomya rufitibia** is found in Hangzhou, Tianmu Mountain, and Jiangshan, while **Calliphora axata** is recorded in Hangzhou. **Brontaea tonitrui** and **Linnaemya** species are also present, as are **Hyleorus elatus** and **Voria ruralis**.  \n\nZhejiang’s biodiversity includes **Meigenia** (*M. grandigena* in Moganshan) and **Bessa** genera, alongside **Leucophora hangzhouensis**, **Fucellia apicalis**, and **Fucellia chinensis**. The province is notable for hosting **Sisyropa prominens** and **Drino inconspicua**, as well as **Cuphocera varia** and **Nupedia fulva**. Specific species like **1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly**, **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**, and **PIERRETIACAUDAGALLI** are documented, with **Rhyncomya setipyga** and **Sarcorohdendorfia** (*S. antilope*, *S. mimobasalis*) also occurring there.  \n\nAgricultural and ecological significance is evident, as Zhejiang is associated with species targeting pests such as the **Rice Borer** and **Rice Leafroller Moth**. The province supports **Muscina** species (including at Tianmu Mountain), **Haematobia**, and **Exorista larvarum**. Additionally, **Compsilura concinnata**, **Dinemomyia nigribasicosta**, and **Isomyia** (*I. electa*, *I. pichoni*, *I. pseudolucilia*) are recorded. **I. tripartita** and **Stomorhina obsoleta** are also found in the region.  \n\nZhejiang’s unique status as a type locality for **1393义乌亚麻蝇** (Yiwu) and **Syngamoptera chekiangensis** (Tianmu Mountain) underscores its role in taxonomic research. The province is further linked to **THICK RING BLACK FLY** (Tianmu Mountain, Beiyandangshan) and **翼阳细麻蝇** (Yiyang). Chinese names for species, such as **半透璃蝇**, **棕尾别麻蝇**, **绿翠蝇**, **东方粪泉蝇**, and **朔粪泉蝇**, are documented, with many tied to Tianmu Mountain.  \n\nIn summary, Zhejiang province in China is a hotspot for dipteran diversity, hosting over 50 species across 20+ genera, including several with restricted distributions or type localities. Its varied habitats, from mountainous regions like Tianmu Mountain to urban centers like Hangzhou, contribute to this richness, making it a vital area for studying fly ecology and taxonomy.\",107\n4008,ARCHIVES OF THE MUSÉUM NATIONAL D'HISTOIRE NATURELLE,A scientific journal where Surcouf described the genus Caiusa in 1919,6\n1503,MOGANSAN,\"\n\n**Mogansan** is a mountainous region located in Zhejiang Province, China, renowned for its ecological significance and biodiversity. Contrary to a conflicting description that incorrectly identifies it as a city, Mogansan is a natural landscape characterized by lush bamboo forests, scenic valleys, and a subtropical climate, making it a notable tourist destination and a hub for environmental research. The area is part of the documented distribution range for two species of flies: *Isomyia pichoni* and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, which are likely associated with the region’s specific habitats, such as its dense vegetation or microclimates. Additionally, Mogansan has been modeled as a key location for *Pegomya japonica mokanensis*, a subspecies of the Pegomya fly, further underscoring its role in entomological studies. These species, all within the family of flies (Diptera), highlight the region’s importance as a biodiversity hotspot, particularly for insects that may rely on the unique ecological conditions of the mountain. The discrepancies in the data—such as the misclassification of Mogansan as a city—are resolved by confirming its status as a geographic and ecological site rather than an urban center. Its inclusion in species distribution models and records reflects its value in understanding the biogeography and habitat preferences of these organisms.

The second antennal segment exhibits a yellow tip, while the fly’s bristle distribution includes small bristles adjacent to the first and second pairs of bristles, as well as dense bristles near the middle of the fifth abdominal plate. These physical traits were first described by Fan in 1964, establishing the species’ taxonomic foundation.  \n\nThe species is reported to have a domestic distribution in China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Hunan (Mangshan), and Fujian. However, the provided data contains a contradiction regarding its type locality, which is stated as Sweden. This discrepancy likely reflects an error, as the species’ scientific name and described distribution align with Chinese entomological records. The type locality for *Pegomya phyllostachys* is more plausibly within its native range in China, given the absence of supporting evidence for a Swedish origin. This inconsistency should be clarified in future taxonomic revisions.  \n\nIn summary, *Pegomya phyllostachys* is a 7.5 mm fly with unique bristle and antennal features, native to southeastern China. Its description by Fan in 1964 remains the primary reference, though the reported type locality in Sweden requires verification to resolve the conflict with its documented geographic range.\",9\n1367,JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,\"\n\nThe *Journal of Entomological Research* (昆虫学研究集刊) is a publication source for descriptions of insect species, including those from the genera *Paraprosalpia* and *Pegomya*.
