He is the author of the genus *Pygophora*, which he described in 1868, and also documented the species *Rhychomyia aberrans* in the same year. Additionally, SCHINER described *Atherigona (Acritochaeta) orientalis* in 1868, a species later reclassified under the subgenus *Acritochaeta* within the genus *Atherigona*. His work in 1861 further established the genus *Pharyngomyia* and the subgenus *Paragusia*, the latter of which he defined as a taxonomic subgroup within *Atherigona*. These contributions highlight his role in systematizing and expanding the classification of dipteran species during the mid-1800s. SCHINER’s research, though focused on specific genera and species, reflects a broader engagement with the morphological and ecological diversity of flies, providing foundational references for subsequent studies in the field. His descriptions, published in the 1860s, remain critical to understanding the historical development of entomological taxonomy and the relationships among these groups. Notably, the subgenus *Paragusia* and the genus *Pharyngomyia* predate his 1868 works, underscoring his sustained scholarly activity over the decade. SCHINER’s legacy is preserved in the continued use of these taxonomic names, which are cited in modern scientific literature to trace the evolutionary and ecological contexts of the species he documented. His efforts in 1861 and 1868 collectively advanced the systematic study of flies, offering insights into their classification that remain relevant to contemporary researchers. By delineating distinct genera and subgenera, SCHINER helped clarify the hierarchical structure of dipteran taxonomy, contributing to the broader scientific understanding of insect biodiversity during his era.\",6\n2493,ZOOLOGISCHE THEIL,Zool.
