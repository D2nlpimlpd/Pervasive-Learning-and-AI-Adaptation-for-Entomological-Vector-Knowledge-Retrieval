It is associated with the same species description and distribution data.\",3\n2355,TUMRASVIN,\"\n\n**TUMRASVIN** is a Thai entomologist notable for his contributions to the study of blow fly taxonomy and biogeography. He is primarily associated with research on the distribution and classification of species within the genera *Neomyia*, *Calliphora*, *Kanomyia*, and *Hosarcophaga*. TUMRASVIN's work on *Neomyia indica* in Thailand has been cited as a key reference for understanding the geographic range of this species. Additionally, he contributed to the documentation of *Calliphora pattoni*, with his 1976 study providing foundational distribution data for this species.  \n\nIn 1979, TUMRASVIN co-authored a significant study on the Star Island Greenbottle Fly (*Neomyia cornuta*), which expanded knowledge of its distribution across Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. This research highlights his role in analyzing the biogeographic patterns of blow flies in the region. The same year, he was also involved in the taxonomic description of the genus *Hosarcophaga*, a contribution to the classification of blow flies.  \n\nTUMRASVIN's 1976 collaborative work, cited as *Tumrasvin et al.*, focused on the foreign origins of certain *Calliphora* species, underscoring his interest in the historical and ecological contexts of fly populations. Furthermore, he co-established the genus *Kanomyia*, which represents a taxonomic advancement in the field. His citations in studies related to *Neomyia* species distribution, including *Neomyia indica*, reflect his broader expertise in the ecology and systematics of this genus.  \n\nWhile some descriptions mention overlapping timelines (e.g., 1976 and 1979), these appear to reference distinct studies or collaborative efforts, as the 1976 work on *Calliphora pattoni* and foreign origins is attributed to a team, whereas the 1979 *Hosarcophaga* and *Neomyia cornuta* studies are linked to his individual or collaborative taxonomic and biogeographic research. TUMRASVIN’s work remains a critical resource for understanding the diversity and geographic spread of blow flies in Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand, where he has documented multiple species. His contributions to both species-level distribution data and higher-level taxonomic classifications demonstrate a comprehensive approach to entomological research.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",7\n4823,HOSARCOHPHAGA,,3\n4822,HOSARCOHPHAGA SERRATA,,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10292,KANOMYIA,SHINONAGA,Shinonaga co-established the genus Kanomyia,29\n9197,PIERRETIA MELANIA,SHINONAGA,Shinonaga is an author of the synonym Pierretia melania for Dinemomyia nigribasicosta,28\n4101,TUMRASVIN,NEOMYIA INDICA,Tumrasvin documented the Indian greenbottle fly in Thailand,22\n9091,HOSARCOHPHAGA,TUMRASVIN,Tumrasvin described the genus Hosarcophaga,10\n9089,HOSARCOHPHAGA SERRATA,HOSARCOHPHAGA,Hosarcophaga serrata belongs to the Hosarcophaga genus,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
