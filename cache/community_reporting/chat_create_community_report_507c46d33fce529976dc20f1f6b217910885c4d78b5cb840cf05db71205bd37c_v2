It is recognized as a key distribution area for the genus *Phaonia* (球麻蝇属), a group of flies within the family Muscidae. Specifically, the region hosts the habitats of two notable species: *Phaonia asierrans* Zinovjev and *Phaonia malaisei* Ringdahl. These species are part of the broader *Phaonia* fauna found in the area, reflecting the ecological diversity of the Soviet Far East as a significant zone for entomological study. The presence of these flies underscores the region’s role in supporting unique arthropod populations, particularly in its temperate and subarctic climates. The Soviet Far East’s geographical position, bordering China, North Korea, and the Pacific Ocean, likely contributes to its distinct biodiversity, including the distribution patterns of *Phaonia* species. This information highlights the area’s importance in understanding the biogeography and ecological adaptations of the genus.\",3\n3287,PH.MALAISEI RINGDAHL,,3\n1965,西伯利亚,\"\n\nSiberia is a vast subregion of the Soviet Union, historically recognized as a significant area for the distribution of various species, including those within the Mesembrina genus. The region serves as a habitat for two notable species: *Ph.falleni* Michelsen and *Ph.sytschevskajae* Hennig, both of which are documented to occur in Siberia. Additionally, the Chinese-named species 介污蝇 (*Mesembrina intermedius*, likely a translation of *Ph.falleni*) and 亚西污蝇 (*Mesembrina sibirica*, possibly corresponding to *Ph.sytschevskajae*) are also reported to be present in the area. These findings highlight Siberia's ecological role in supporting diverse populations of the Mesembrina genus, a group of flies often associated with specific environmental conditions. While the descriptions emphasize the Soviet Union as the geopolitical context, it is important to note that Siberia spans a large portion of northern Eurasia and has been a focal point for biological studies due to its unique ecosystems. The inclusion of both Latin and Chinese species names reflects the region's significance in international scientific research, though the exact taxonomic relationships between the named species may require further clarification to resolve potential overlaps or discrepancies. Overall, Siberia is characterized as a key distribution zone for these Mesembrina species, underscoring its importance in entomological studies.
