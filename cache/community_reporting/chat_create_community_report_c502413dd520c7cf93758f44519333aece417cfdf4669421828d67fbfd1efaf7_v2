He is credited as the author of the genus *Syllegopterula*, which he described in 1893, and the genus *Chiastocheta*, established in 1889. Additionally, POKORNY described the genus *Dexiopsis* in 1893, as well as the genus *Parastauferia* in the same year. His work on *Delia majuscula* is also noted, with descriptions of both the species and its genus. Furthermore, he is recognized for describing the species *Ph. tenuiseta* (likely a member of the genus *Phaonia* or a similar taxon, though the full genus name is not specified in the data). These contributions highlight his role in classifying and naming various fly species and genera during the late 19th century. The data consistently attributes these taxonomic acts to POKORNY, with no contradictions in the years or entities mentioned. His work spans multiple genera, including *Chiastocheta* (1889), *Syllegopterula* (1893), *Dexiopsis* (1893), and *Parastauferia* (1893), as well as the species *Delia majuscula* and *Ph. tenuiseta*. The descriptions are presented in both English and Chinese, but the entity names and dates align across all entries. POKORNY’s legacy in entomology is marked by his meticulous documentation of these taxa, contributing to the foundational understanding of their classification.
