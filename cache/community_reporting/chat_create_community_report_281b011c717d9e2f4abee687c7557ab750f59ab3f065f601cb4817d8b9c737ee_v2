The species is characterized by its **red-yellow body features**, including **red-yellow legs and antennae** as noted in one source, while another description specifies a **body length of 4 mm**. These physical traits suggest a distinct coloration pattern that may aid in identification within its habitats.  \n\nRegarding its distribution, there is a notable discrepancy between the two descriptions. One source states that *Caricea boops* is found in **Taiwan (Tainan), Guangdong (coastal islands), India, and Indonesia**, regions spanning East and Southeast Asia. The other description claims its distribution is in **Europe**, which conflicts with the Asian range. This contradiction could arise from taxonomic confusion, regional misreporting, or the possibility that the species has a broader geographic range than previously documented. Further research or verification of regional records may be necessary to resolve this inconsistency.  \n\nThe species’ name and classification remain consistent across both descriptions, with **Thomson (1869)** cited as the original describer. While the first source emphasizes specific anatomical features (legs and antennae), the second provides a more general reference to red-yellow body coloration. Combining these details, *Caricea boops* appears to exhibit a striking red-yellow hue across multiple body parts, with a compact size of 4 mm.  \n\nIn summary, *Caricea boops* is a 4 mm-long fly species described in 1869, noted for its red-yellow coloration. Its distribution is reported in **Asia** (Taiwan, Guangdong, India, Indonesia) and **Europe**, though the overlap or validity of the European range remains unclear.
