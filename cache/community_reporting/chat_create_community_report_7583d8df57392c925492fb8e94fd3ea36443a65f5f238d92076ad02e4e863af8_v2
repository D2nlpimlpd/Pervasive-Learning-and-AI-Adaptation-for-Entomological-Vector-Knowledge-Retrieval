They described the nominate subspecies *Delia rondanii* in 1918 and *Eutrichota pilimana* in the same year, as well as *Helina bohemani* in 1916. In 1922, RINGDAHL documented *Lispe loewi*, and in 1924, they published a note on the antennae of *Helina subvittata*. Their work in 1926 included the description of *Fannia bisetosa* and *Nodulosa Fannia* (likely a synonym or related species).  \n\nRINGDAHL’s taxonomic activity expanded in the 1930s, with significant contributions to genera and species. They described the genus *Chionomyia* in 1933 and the subgenus *Arctopegomyia* in 1938. In 1933, they also introduced *Subhylemyia* and *Paradelia* genera, while in 1935, they documented *Lasiomma curtigena* and *Pegohylemyia hucketti*. The 1930s saw further work on *Coenosia griseiventris* (1930) and *Coenosia luteipes* (1930), though a conflicting 1869 date for *Coenosia incisurata* is likely an error. In 1934, RINGDAHL described *Paraprosalpia aldrichi* and the genus *Pseudomyopina*. Their 1938 work included the genus *Eutrichota*.  \n\nAdditional species attributed to RINGDAHL include *Phaonia malaisei* (1930), *Fucellia kamtchatica* (1930), *Delia brassicaeformis*, and *Ph. wohlbergi*. They also described *Pogohylemyia coronata* (冕形泉种蝇) in 1951 and *Pegohylemyia tuxeni* in 1953. In 1959, RINGDAHL introduced the genus *Pseudonupedia*. Their studies on *Phaonia* in 1949 and 1963, as well as *Hydrophoria zetterstedti* (1918), further highlight their focus on fly taxonomy.  \n\nRINGDAHL’s work spans multiple genera, including *Acklandia* (with *A. subgrisea* and *A. aculeata*), *Monochrotogaster unicolor*, and *Pseudomyopina*. They also contributed to the understanding of *Paraprosalpia* (originally under *Pseudochirosia* in 1928) and *Subhylemyia*. Despite some inconsistencies in dates (e.g., *Coenosia incisurata* in 1869, which may be a misattribution), their legacy is marked by systematic descriptions of diverse dipteran taxa.  \n\nRINGDAHL’s career reflects a deep engagement with both species-level and higher-level classifications, particularly within the families Muscidae and Syrphidae. Their publications in journals such as *Entomologisk Tidskrift* (Ent.Tidskr.) and their role in defining genera like *Chionomyia* and *Paradelia* underscore their influence in entomological taxonomy.

It is taxonomically related to the genus *Pegomya*, sharing certain morphological similarities, but is distinguished by unique characteristics in bristle patterns and tail structures. Key diagnostic features of *Paradelia* include the notched lateral lobes of the fifth abdominal tergite, a trait not observed in *Pegomya*, and the presence of long, curved setae (bristles) on the abdomen, which contribute to its distinct appearance. These abdominal features, particularly the notched lobes, are critical for differentiating *Paradelia* from closely related genera within the same family. The bristle patterns, while not explicitly detailed in the descriptions, are noted as a primary morphological divergence from *Pegomya*, likely involving variations in arrangement, density, or shape. Additionally, the tail structures of *Paradelia*—possibly referring to terminal abdominal segments or appendages—exhibit unique traits that further set it apart. The combination of these features, including the notched abdominal lobes and specialized setae, underscores the genus’s evolutionary adaptations and taxonomic significance. Ringdahl’s original classification emphasized these morphological distinctions to establish *Paradelia* as a separate entity within the fly family, reflecting its role in clarifying biodiversity and phylogenetic relationships among similar species.
