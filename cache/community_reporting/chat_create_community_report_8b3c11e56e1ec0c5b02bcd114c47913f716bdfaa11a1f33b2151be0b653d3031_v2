It serves as the type locality for *Servaisia cothurnata*, a species whose classification and nomenclature are anchored to this location. Additionally, Benxi is the type locality for *Blaesoxipha dongfangis* and *长白山点池蝇* (Changbaishan Dianchiying), a species likely associated with the Changbai Mountains region. The city is also linked to the distribution of *银额阳蝇* (Yin'e Yangying), a species whose presence in the area has been documented. \n\nBenxi is further notable for its association with multiple *Blaesoxipha* species, indicating it as a key site for the genus's biodiversity. The area is also marked as a domestic distribution location for *Helina* species, which are found in both Liaoning and Shaanxi provinces. However, it is important to clarify that while *Helina* species are present in these regions, Benxi itself is specifically situated in Liaoning. \n\nIn Chinese entomological contexts, Benxi is highlighted as one of the distribution sites for the genus *斑麻蝇属* (Chromatomyia), a group of flies. This aligns with its role as a hub for diverse fly species, including those with specific ecological or taxonomic significance. The city’s prominence in scientific literature stems from its repeated designation as a type locality, a status that underscores its importance in the study and classification of these organisms. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Benxi’s ecological and taxonomic relevance, particularly in the fields of dipterology (study of flies) and related biological disciplines. While some references mention broader regional distributions (e.g., *Helina* in Shaanxi), the core data consistently identifies Benxi as a Liaoning-based city with specific ties to the type localities and habitats of multiple species. This synthesis resolves any apparent contradictions by focusing on Benxi’s direct associations, ensuring a coherent summary of its role in scientific research. \n\nIn total, Benxi is a critical location for understanding the biodiversity and taxonomy of flies, including *Servaisia cothurnata*, *Blaesoxipha* species, *长白山点池蝇*, *银额阳蝇*, and *斑麻蝇属*. Its designation as a type locality for several species highlights its importance in defining their geographic origins, while its role as a distribution site reflects its ecological suitability for these organisms. The city’s contributions to entomological studies in Liaoning and its connections to broader regional species distributions underscore its value as a focal point for scientific investigation.\",5\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4730,长白山点池蝇,XUE,Xue于1981年描述了长白山点池蝇,62\n8863,本溪,HSUE,Hsue is associated with the type locality in Benxi city,34\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
