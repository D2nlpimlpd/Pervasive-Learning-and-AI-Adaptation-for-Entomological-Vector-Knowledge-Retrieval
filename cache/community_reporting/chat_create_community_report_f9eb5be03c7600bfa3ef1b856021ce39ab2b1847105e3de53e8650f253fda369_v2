It has served as a key platform for documenting new species and their morphological characteristics, with contributions spanning multiple volumes. For example, Volume 5 of the series includes pages 305–308 and features figures 14–25, detailing descriptions of *Isomyia sagittalis*, *Isomyia quadrina*, and other *Isomyia* species. Similarly, *Isomyia lingulata* and *Isomyia furcicula* have been published in the series, further expanding the understanding of this genus.  \n\nThe journal has also been instrumental in describing species from the *Oestroderma* genus, including *Qinghai Oestroderma*, *Sichuan Oestroderma*, and *Tibetan Oestroderma*, which are associated with specific geographic regions in China. Additionally, *Helina truncata* was documented in Volume 6, specifically on page 240, accompanied by figures 11–12. Another notable entry is the 1984 description of *斑脉缘花蝇* (a Chinese species name) by researcher Fan, underscoring the series’ role in regional entomological studies.  \n\nThe publication series extends to the *Drymeia* genus, where several species have been formally described, including *Drymeia yadongensis*, *Drymeia midtibia*, *Drymeia qiaoershanensis*, *Drymeia hirsutitibia*, *Drymeia totipilosa*, and *Drymeia plumisaeta*. These contributions highlight the journal’s focus on documenting diverse fly species, particularly those with ecological or taxonomic significance in China.  \n\nBy consolidating species descriptions, morphological illustrations, and regional studies, the **Entomological Research Series** provides a comprehensive resource for entomologists, offering insights into the taxonomy, distribution, and biological features of various fly species. Its structured format, with detailed volume and page references, ensures accessibility to specific findings, such as the *Isomyia* species in Volume 5 or *Helina truncata* in Volume 6. The inclusion of both Latin and Chinese species names, as seen in the 1984 *斑脉缘花蝇* entry, reflects its commitment to bridging international and local scientific communities. Overall, the series plays a vital role in advancing entomological knowledge, particularly in documenting understudied or regionally endemic species.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",30\n4346,JINGPING MENG LA,\"A location in Yunnan, China, where Isomyia quadrina is documented.\",1\n4177,RUILI,\"\n\n**RUILI** is a city located in Yunnan Province, China, recognized as a significant geographical site in entomological studies. It serves as the **type locality** for two species of the genus *Isomyia*: *Isomyia sagittalis* and *Isomyia lingulata*, meaning these species were first identified and described based on specimens collected there. Additionally, RUILI is part of the **distribution range** for *Isomyia cupreoviridis*, indicating the presence of this species in the region. The city’s ecological and geographical characteristics, likely influenced by Yunnan’s biodiversity-rich environment, make it a key location for the study of these mosquito species. While the descriptions emphasize RUILI’s role in the taxonomy and ecology of *Isomyia*, they collectively highlight its importance as a hub for understanding the distribution and classification of these insects. The term \"\"Ruli\"\" in the fourth description aligns with the entity \"\"RUILI,\"\" confirming the city’s name and its association with the species mentioned. No contradictions exist among the descriptions, as they all reinforce RUILI’s connection to the *Isomyia* genus through distinct but complementary roles.
