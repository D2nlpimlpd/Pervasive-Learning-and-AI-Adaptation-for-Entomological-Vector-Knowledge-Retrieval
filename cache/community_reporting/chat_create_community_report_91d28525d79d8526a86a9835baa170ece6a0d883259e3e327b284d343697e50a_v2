Key species and genera documented in the Soviet Union include **Macronychia striginervis** and **Macronychia polyodon**, as well as **Pseudocoenosia fletcheri**, which was found in Siberia and the Ural Mountains. The **Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia** and **Servillia ardens** were also recorded, alongside **Tachina albidopilosa** and **Tachina nupta**, which were distributed internationally within the country.  \n\nThe Soviet Union hosted multiple species of the **Helina** genus, including **Helina confinis** in the Far East and Northern/Central Europe, **Helina cothurnata**, **Helina latitarsis**, and others in regions like Siberia, Tajikistan, and the European part. **Parasarcophaga** species such as **Parasarcophaga pleskei**, **Parasarcophaga portschinskyi**, and **Parasarcophaga emdeni** were documented, as were **Phaonia** species like **Phaonia fuscata** (Far East, Western Siberia, Tajikistan, and European regions), **Phaonia hybrida**, **Phaonia malaisei**, and **Phaonia nigripennis**.
