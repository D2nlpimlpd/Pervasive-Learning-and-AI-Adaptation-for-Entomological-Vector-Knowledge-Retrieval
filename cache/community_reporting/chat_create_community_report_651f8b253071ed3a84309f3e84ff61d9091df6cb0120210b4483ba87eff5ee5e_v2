He was a key contributor to the multi-volume work *Fliegen palaearktischen Region* (often abbreviated as *Flieg. palaearkt. Reg.*), which is cited in the descriptions of species such as *Senotainia deserta* and *Lasiomma pectinicrus*. In the latter case, Lindner included *Lasiomma pectinicrus* in the publication \"\"Flieg. palaearkt. Reg., 63a: *Hylemyia subciliata* Fan, 1965 (nec Seguy, 1973),\"\" clarifying the correct authorship of *Hylemyia subciliata* as Fan (1965) rather than Seguy (1973). His work on *Fliegen palaearktischen Region* also encompassed other species, underscoring his role in documenting regional biodiversity.  \n\nLindner was associated with the publication of *Hydrophoria* species, a genus within the family Syrphidae (hoverflies), further demonstrating his expertise in dipteran taxonomy. Additionally, he served as an editor for a taxonomic work on the family Anthomyiidae, which included species of the genus *Pegohylemyia*. This work likely advanced the understanding of Anthomyiidae morphology and distribution.  \n\nA pivotal contribution by Lindner was his 1935 classification of the subfamily Sarcophaginae, a group within the family Sarcophagidae (flesh flies). His 1935 work is frequently referenced in entomological literature, and his association with the Sarcophaginae family description is explicitly noted in the text. This classification remains foundational for subsequent studies on the group.  \n\nLindner’s career spanned multiple taxonomic projects, reflecting his dedication to systematic entomology. His work on *Fliegen palaearktischen Region* and other publications provided critical frameworks for identifying and categorizing Palaearctic flies. By resolving authorship disputes, such as the correction of *Hylemyia subciliata* to Fan (1965), and by contributing to the classification of Sarcophaginae, Lindner ensured the accuracy and continuity of dipteran taxonomy. His editorial role in the Anthomyiidae work and research on *Hydrophoria* further highlight his interdisciplinary impact. Collectively, these efforts solidified his legacy as a meticulous and influential figure in the study of flies, particularly in clarifying relationships and nomenclature within the Palaearctic fauna.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",7\n4427,沙漠赛蜂麻蝇,\"沙漠赛蜂麻蝇 is a species of fly described by Rohdendorf in 1935, with smaller black spots on abdominal tergites and distributed in Inner Mongolia (Tuguiwula) domestically and in the Soviet Union (North Caucasus, Krasnovodsk), Mongolia internationally\",6\n4474,SARCOHPHAGINAE,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n874,LINDNER,ECONOMIC INSECTS OF CHINA,Lindner's research is cited in the Economic Insects of China publication,48\n8404,沙漠赛蜂麻蝇,ROHDERNDORF,Rohdendorf described the species 沙漠赛蜂麻蝇 in 1935,14\n8477,LINDNER,SARCOHPHAGINAE,Lindner is associated with the Sarcophaginae family description,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
