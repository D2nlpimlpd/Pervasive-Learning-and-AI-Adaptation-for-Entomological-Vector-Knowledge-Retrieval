Distributed in Chinese provinces and the USSR (Far East, Ussuri as type locality)\",2\n5059,ΦAYHA CCCP,\"\n\nThe entity \"\"ΦAYHA CCCP\"\" refers to a 1937 Soviet Union journal publication that documented multiple entomological discoveries. This publication is notable for three key contributions: the description of *Pierretia (s.str.) sororcula* by B. Rohdendorf, the inclusion of *Phallocheira minor* in the Soviet Union’s Diptera records, and the formal description of the species 1341细角细麻蝇 (translated as *Chaetostomella sororcula* or a related species, depending on taxonomic alignment). All three entries were published within the same journal issue or series, reflecting the Soviet Union’s efforts to catalog and classify insect biodiversity during the 1930s.  \n\nThe first entry, *Pierretia (s.str.) sororcula*, was described by B. Rohdendorf, a prominent Soviet entomologist known for his work on Diptera. The species is part of the genus *Pierretia*, which is typically associated with specific ecological or morphological traits within the fly family. The second entry, *Phallocheira minor*, was added to the Soviet Union’s Diptera records, likely expanding the known distribution or taxonomic understanding of this species. The third entry, 1341细角细麻蝇, is a Chinese-named species (translating to \"\"fine-horned small botfly\"\") that was formally described in the Russian journal, indicating cross-regional taxonomic collaboration or the documentation of species found in Soviet territories with Chinese linguistic influence.  \n\nWhile the descriptions appear to reference distinct species, the entity \"\"ΦAYHA CCCP\"\" consolidates these as part of a single publication event. The apparent overlap in naming (e.g., \"\"sororcula\"\" in both *Pierretia* and the Chinese-named species) may suggest a taxonomic synonym or a shared lineage, though the journal likely treated them as separate entries. The publication’s focus on Diptera (flies) highlights its role in advancing Soviet entomological science, with contributions from both domestic and potentially international researchers. The use of the Chinese name for one species implies that the journal either documented specimens from regions with Chinese-speaking populations or incorporated local nomenclature for clarity.  \n\nIn summary, \"\"ΦAYHA CCCP\"\" is a 1937 Soviet Union journal that served as a platform for describing three significant Diptera species: *Pierretia (s.str.) sororcula* by Rohdendorf, *Phallocheira minor*, and 1341细角细麻蝇. These entries reflect the journal’s contribution to entomological taxonomy, bridging Soviet scientific efforts with regional and linguistic contexts. The publication remains a historical record of biodiversity studies in the Soviet Union during the early 20th century.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",9\n5210,大洋洲区,Biogeographic region (Irian) where Harpagophalla is distributed,1\n5184,SARCOHPHAGA SERA,Type species of the Harpagophalla genus,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9868,钩麻蝇属,ROHDENDORF,Rohdendorf established the genus Harpagophalla,99\n9457,ROHDENDORF,PIERRETIA (S.STR.)
