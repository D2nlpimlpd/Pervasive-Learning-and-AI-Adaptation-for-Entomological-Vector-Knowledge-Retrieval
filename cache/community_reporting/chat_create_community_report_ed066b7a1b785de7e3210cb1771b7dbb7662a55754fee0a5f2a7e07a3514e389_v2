The journal has served as a platform for entomologists to document new species and their initial taxonomic placements. Among the species associated with this publication are *Pegoplata virginea*, which was first described in 1826 under the genus *Anthomyia*; *Botanophila varicolor*, referenced in the journal; *Pegohylemyia fugax*, described within its pages; *Pseudonupedia intersecta*, detailed in SYST.BESCHR. with its original classification also under *Anthomyia*; and *Hylemya partita*, another species formally described in the same publication. These entries highlight the journal’s role in early 19th-century entomology, particularly in the systematic study of flies, where species were often reclassified over time as taxonomic understanding evolved. For instance, *Pegoplata virginea* and *Pseudonupedia intersecta* were initially placed in *Anthomyia*, a genus that has since been revised, with these species moved to their current genera. The journal’s contributions to dipteran taxonomy are notable for establishing foundational records, even as subsequent research has refined their classifications. SYST.BESCHR. remains a key historical source for understanding the nomenclatural history and phylogenetic relationships of these species. Its descriptions provide critical baseline data for modern taxonomists to trace the evolution of scientific naming conventions and ecological insights into these fly species. The publication’s focus on systematic biology underscores its importance in the broader context of biodiversity documentation during its active period. While specific dates for all species are not provided, the 1826 reference for *Pegoplata virginea* situates SYST.BESCHR. as a 19th-century resource, aligning with the era’s emphasis on formalizing biological classifications. The inclusion of multiple species across different genera (e.g., *Pegohylemyia*, *Pseudonupedia*, *Hylemya*) suggests the journal covered a range of dipteran families, contributing to the taxonomic framework of the time. Overall, SYST.BESCHR. exemplifies the iterative nature of scientific classification, where initial groupings are later adjusted based on new evidence, and its records remain valuable for both historical and contemporary entomological research.\",6\n1728,厩腐蝇,\"A species of fly, Muscina(s.str.) stabulans (Fallen, 1823), widely distributed in China and globally.
