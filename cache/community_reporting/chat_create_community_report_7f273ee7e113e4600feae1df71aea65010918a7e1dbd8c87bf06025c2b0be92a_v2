It is taxonomically distinguished by the presence of robust bristle rows on the front femur, a key morphological characteristic that aids in its identification. Additionally, the genus exhibits specific wing features, which further contribute to its classification within this family. The Scathophagidae family is part of the order Diptera (true flies), and its members are typically associated with ecological niches involving decomposition or detritus, though detailed behavioral traits of *Norellia* remain less documented.  \n\nThe genus *Norellia* is reported to include two recognized species: *长腹鬃粪蝇* (Long-abdominal Bristle Dung Fly) and *角板鬃粪蝇* (Angle-plate Bristle Dung Fly). These species names, provided in Chinese, align with the family’s common name (*粪蝇科*), suggesting their ecological relevance to dung or similar substrates. However, the English translation of these species names is not explicitly stated in the data, and their morphological or genetic distinctions from one another are not elaborated.  \n\nThe descriptions provided are consistent in defining *Norellia* as a Scathophagidae genus with two species and specific anatomical traits. No contradictions exist between the two entries, as they complement each other by specifying the family classification in both English and Chinese and listing the species. The summary integrates the morphological features (bristle rows and wing characteristics) from the first description with the species-level information from the second.  \n\nIn conclusion, *Norellia* is a well-defined genus in the dung fly family Scathophagidae, characterized by robust bristle rows on the front femur and unique wing structures. It comprises two species, *长腹鬃粪蝇* and *角板鬃粪蝇*, which are likely adapted to ecological roles within their family. Further research may clarify the species’ geographic distribution, life history, or ecological functions, but the current data establishes a clear taxonomic and morphological framework for the genus.  \n\n(Word count: 200)\",5\n349,长腹鬃粪蝇,长腹鬃粪蝇（Norellia longiabdomina）是1991年由Sun描述的粪蝇科物种，特征包括♂下颚须黄，线状，末端有1明显长鬃，体长11-14毫米，分布于中国四川峨眉山九老洞（模式产地）,4\n353,SUN,\"\n\n**SUN** is a taxonomist recognized for their contributions to the classification of fly species.

The same year, they also co-described the species *棕须阳蝇* (likely a Chinese name for a related or distinct fly species, though the exact scientific name is not provided in the data). By 1991, SUN expanded their work, independently describing two additional species: *长腹鬃粪蝇* (translated as \"\"Long-abdominal Hairy Feces Fly\"\") and *角板鬃粪蝇* (\"\"Horn-plate Hairy Feces Fly\"\"), both belonging to the family Muscidae. These contributions highlight SUN's expertise in entomology, particularly in the taxonomy of flies, and their role in documenting biodiversity through collaborative and independent research efforts. The species described by SUN span different genera and ecological contexts, reflecting a broad engagement with fly morphology and classification. While the 1987 work involved collaboration, the 1991 descriptions were conducted as a sole author, underscoring their growing authority in the field.
