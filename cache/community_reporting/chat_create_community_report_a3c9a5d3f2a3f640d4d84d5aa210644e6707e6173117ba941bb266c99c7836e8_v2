He first gained recognition in 1916 for documenting the parasitism of the genus *Sphegina* (斑麻蝇属) on locusts, a significant ecological observation in entomology. In 1925, he described the species *Mesembrina magnifica*, and the following year (1926), he authored the description of *Peteina hyperdiscalis*. By 1930, Aldrich had described multiple genera and species, including the genus *Xanthotryxus* and its species *X. mongol*, as well as the genus *Aldrichina*, which was later named in his honor for the species *Aldrichina grahami* (Aldrich, 1930). The same year, he also provided the first description of *Dexopollenia flava*. In 1932, he described the large hoverfly *Scathophaga gigantea* and the genus *Trophops*, though the latter was later synonymized with *Pexopsis*. His work continued into 1933 with the description of *Elodia subfasciata*, and in 1935, he documented *Dexopollenia geniculata*. Additionally, Aldrich is credited as the author of *Mesembrina tristis*, further expanding his taxonomic legacy in the *Mesembrina* genus. His research spanned diverse fly families, including Syrphidae (hoverflies) and Tachinidae (parasitic flies), with a focus on morphological classification and ecological relationships. The genus *Aldrichina*, established for the species *A. grahami*, remains a direct tribute to his work. Despite the synonymization of *Trophops*, his descriptions of *Dexopollenia* species and other genera have endured in scientific literature. Aldrich’s contributions, spanning over two decades, reflect a dedicated effort to catalog and understand dipteran biodiversity, particularly in regions where his studies were conducted. His work in 1930, which included both *Xanthotryxus* and *Aldrichina*, highlights his dual role as both a describer of new taxa and a namesake for a genus. The 1935 description of *Dexopollenia geniculata* further underscores his ongoing engagement with fly taxonomy. Overall, Aldrich’s legacy is preserved in the nomenclature of several species and genera, as well as in historical records of parasitic interactions, cementing his place in entomological history.

The larvae of this family are distinguished by specific anatomical features, including 12 or more short projections on the eighth abdominal segment, which are part of the broader description of \"\"distinct abdominal segment features.\"\" These larvae also possess unique spiracle structures, a trait that contributes to their identification within the family. Additionally, the anal cerci (or anal tubercles) of the larvae are typically broad and short, further differentiating them from other fly families.  \n\nAdult Anthomyiidae display notable traits such as developed lower calypters, which are flap-like structures on the wings, and a unique wing venation pattern. These features are critical for distinguishing the family in taxonomic classifications. The family is well-documented in entomological studies, with its placement in the broader fly taxonomy being a subject of discussion due to its distinct morphological and ecological attributes.  \n\nWhile the descriptions provided emphasize both larval and adult characteristics, they collectively highlight the family’s specialized adaptations. The combination of larval abdominal projections, spiracle structures, and broad anal cerci, alongside adult features like calypters and wing venation, underscores the taxonomic significance of Anthomyiidae. These traits are consistent across the descriptions, with no direct contradictions observed. The family’s role in ecological systems, particularly as flower-associated insects, is implied through the common name \"\"flower flies,\"\" though specific behavioral or ecological details are not elaborated in the given data.  \n\nIn summary, Anthomyiidae is a fly family characterized by larvae with 12 or more short projections on the eighth abdominal segment, broad and short anal cerci, and specific spiracle structures, while adults exhibit developed lower calypters and a distinctive wing venation pattern.

The genus includes species such as *青稞穗蝇* (barley stem fly), which is notable for its ecological and agricultural significance. Taxonomically, Nanna belongs to the order Diptera (true flies) and is part of the broader group of scathophagid flies, commonly referred to as dung flies or flower flies, though this classification may vary depending on specific phylogenetic studies. Morphological features of the genus, beyond the abdominal bristle ratio, likely include traits such as body size, wing venation, or coloration patterns typical of Scathophagidae, though these are not explicitly detailed in the provided descriptions. The Chinese name *穗蝇属* directly translates to \"\"spike fly genus,\"\" reflecting the association of some species within the genus with plant spikes or stems, as seen in *青稞穗蝇*. This species is particularly relevant in regions where barley is cultivated, as it may impact crop health. While the descriptions do not elaborate on the geographic distribution or behavioral ecology of the genus, the inclusion of *青稞穗蝇* suggests a focus on species with agricultural or ecological importance. The genus Nanna is thus defined by its taxonomic placement in Scathophagidae, the 1:2 abdominal bristle ratio, and the presence of species like the barley stem fly, which are linked to plant interactions. Further research or detailed taxonomic studies would be required to fully delineate the morphological, ecological, and phylogenetic scope of the genus.

This taxonomic classification is based on specific anatomical features, particularly those observed in the male terminalia, which are critical for identifying and differentiating tribes within the subfamily. The tribe is further defined by additional morphological criteria, though these are not explicitly detailed in the provided descriptions. The name \"\"EGLINI\"\" reflects its systematic placement in the broader context of Diptera (true flies) and underscores its evolutionary or ecological significance within the Anthomyiinae. While the first description emphasizes the absence of the postgenical sclerite as a defining characteristic, the second highlights the tribe’s inclusion in the Anthomyiinae subfamily and its reliance on morphological traits for classification. These two accounts are consistent in identifying EGLINI as a distinct taxonomic group within the subfamily, with the primary divergence being the phrasing of the subfamily name (Anthomyiinae vs. Anthomyiina). The subfamily Anthomyiinae is part of the family Muscidae, which includes various flies such as houseflies and fruit flies, and EGLINI’s unique features contribute to the subfamily’s taxonomic diversity. The tribe’s classification is likely supported by entomological studies that use detailed anatomical comparisons to establish phylogenetic relationships. No contradictions exist in the core information provided, as both descriptions align on the tribe’s placement and the absence of the postgenital sclerite as a diagnostic trait. The summary integrates the available data to present EGLINI as a morphologically distinct and taxonomically recognized group within the Anthomyiinae subfamily, emphasizing its defining characteristic and broader classification context.\",1\n408,ANTHOMYIINI,\"\n\n**ANTHOMYIINI** is a tribe within the **Anthomyiinae** subfamily of the fly family Muscidae. This taxonomic group is distinguished by two key morphological features: the presence of a **postgenital sclerite on the epandrium**, a hardened structure in the male genitalia, and a **simple aedeagus** (the intromittent organ of the male reproductive system) accompanied by **distinct parameres** (lateral appendages of the aedeagus). These traits collectively serve as diagnostic markers for the tribe, aiding in its classification and differentiation from other related groups within the subfamily. The postgenital sclerite on the epandrium is a notable anatomical characteristic that contributes to the structural complexity of the male terminalia, while the simplicity of the aedeagus and the prominence of parameres suggest adaptations in reproductive behavior or mechanics. Despite minor variations in phrasing between the descriptions (e.g., \"\"Anthomyiina\"\" vs. \"\"Anthomyiinae\"\"), the tribe is consistently associated with the subfamily **Anthomyiinae**, which is part of the larger superfamily Muscoidea. ANTHOMYIINI is recognized for its role in the evolutionary and taxonomic framework of muscoid flies, with these morphological traits reflecting its phylogenetic distinctiveness. The tribe’s defining features are critical for entomologists in identifying and studying its members, which may include species with ecological or agricultural significance. Overall, the combination of a postgenital sclerite, a simple aedeagus, and distinct parameres establishes ANTHOMYIINI as a well-defined taxonomic unit within the Anthomyiinae subfamily.\",1\n409,ACRIDOMYIINI,\"\n\nThe ACRIDOMYIINI are a tribe within the subfamily Anthomyiinae (family Muscidae), characterized by a combination of distinct morphological features that aid in their taxonomic identification. Members of this tribe are primarily defined by the absence of a labellar tooth, a structure typically present in other anthomyiid flies, which differentiates them from closely related groups. Additionally, they exhibit a unique wing bristle pattern, a key diagnostic trait that contributes to their classification. Another notable feature is the absence of a lower labellum, a part of the proboscis, which further distinguishes them from other tribes in the subfamily. The hardened aedeagus, a rigid and often sclerotized male genital structure, is also a consistent characteristic among ACRIDOMYIINI species, playing a role in reproductive specialization. These traits collectively—loss of the labellar tooth, absence of the lower labellum, specific wing bristle arrangements, and a hardened aedeagus—form the basis for their taxonomic separation and ecological adaptation. While the descriptions provided highlight slightly different aspects (e.g., \"\"labellar tooth\"\" vs. \"\"lower labellum\"\"), these features are not mutually exclusive and can coexist as part of the tribe’s defining morphology. The ACRIDOMYIINI are thus recognized by a suite of anatomical traits that reflect both their evolutionary divergence and functional adaptations within the broader context of the Anthomyiinae subfamily.\",1\n410,HYDROPHORINI,\"\n\nThe tribe **HYDROPHORINI** is a taxonomic group within the subfamily **Anthomyiinae** (Diptera: Muscidae), characterized by distinct morphological features that distinguish it from other related tribes. Members of HYDROPHORINI are primarily defined by specific structures in their male genitalia and wing anatomy. Morphologically, the tribe is marked by the presence of **lateral processes on the epandrium** (a component of the male genitalia) that bear a **hairy projection** and a **terminal plate separated from the epandrium**. These traits are critical for identification and classification within the subfamily. Additionally, HYDROPHORINI species exhibit **large lower axillary lobes** on the wings, which are prominent anatomical features contributing to their taxonomic recognition. The **parameres** (another part of the male genitalia) are also specialized in this tribe, further supporting its distinct evolutionary lineage. \n\nThe combination of these traits—epandrial modifications, wing lobes, and parameral specialization—provides a cohesive framework for diagnosing HYDROPHORINI. While the first description emphasizes the epandrium’s structure, the second highlights the axillary lobes and parameres, both of which are consistent and complementary. These features collectively reflect adaptations potentially linked to ecological or reproductive behaviors, though specific functional hypotheses remain unexplored in the provided data. The tribe’s placement within Anthomyiinae aligns with broader phylogenetic studies of muscoid flies, which group organisms based on shared derived characteristics. \n\nHYDROPHORINI is notable for its morphological uniqueness, which aids in differentiating it from other tribes in the subfamily. The hairy projection on the epandrium’s lateral processes and the detached terminal plate suggest a specialized developmental or mechanical role in mating or sensory functions. The large lower axillary lobes, meanwhile, may influence flight dynamics or serve as taxonomic markers for species identification. The parameres’ specialization further underscores the tribe’s distinctiveness, as these structures often play a role in copulatory mechanisms. \n\nIn summary, **HYDROPHORINI** is a well-defined tribe within the **Anthomyiinae** subfamily, characterized by a combination of epandrial, wing, and parameral features. These traits, including the hairy lateral processes of the epandrium, a terminal plate separated from the epandrium, large lower axillary lobes, and specialized parameres, collectively establish its identity and evolutionary divergence. The descriptions provided are non-contradictory and reinforce a unified taxonomic profile, emphasizing the tribe’s morphological distinctiveness in the context of muscoid fly systematics.\",1\n3996,DEXOPOLLENIA FLAVA,\"Species of fly described by Aldrich in 1930, found in Sichuan and Japan\",4\n405,PEGOMYINA,Subfamily of Anthomyiidae with flattened lateral parameres and other traits.,2\n396,YULONG GANG,\"Area in Sichuan, China, where Scathophaga gigantea is distributed (type locality).\",1\n1987,ANNING,\"A city in Yunnan, China, where Mesembrina magnifica is distributed\",1\n1988,MOKOK,\"A location in Tibet, China, where Mesembrina magnifica is distributed\",1\n4266,\"ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY, 1830\",Author who established the genus Rhyncomya in 1830,2\n4277,RHYNCOMYA FLAVIBASIS,\"Species described in Mem.
