It is notably associated with the species *611扁蹠芒蝇* (a Chinese name for a fly, likely *Chrysomya megacephala* or a similar blowfly, though the exact scientific name requires verification). The city is also home to multiple *Dichaetomyia* species, a genus of flies within the family Muscidae, with specific records highlighting the presence of *Dichaetomyia quadrata*. These species are distributed domestically within Kaohsiung, and the city hosts key type localities such as Jiaxianpu and Zukou, which are critical for taxonomic research and identification of these flies. Additionally, Kaohsiung is linked to *Helina lateralis*, a species in the family Muscidae, further underscoring its ecological importance in the region. The repeated mention of \"\"the species\"\" in the descriptions likely refers to the aforementioned *Dichaetomyia* and *611扁蹠芒蝇* groups, emphasizing Kaohsiung's role as a hub for their biodiversity. While some descriptions use the term \"\"Taiwan, China,\"\" the city is internationally recognized as part of Taiwan, and its status as a center for entomological studies is consistent across all accounts. The combination of these species and their documented localities in Kaohsiung highlights its relevance in understanding the distribution and taxonomy of flies in Taiwan.\",6\n3006,JIASHANPU,,2\n2992,TAICHUNG,\"\n\n**TAICHUNG** is a city located in central Taiwan, known for its diverse ecological habitats that support multiple species of the genus *Dichaetomyia*, a group of flies within the family Muscidae. The city serves as a significant domestic distribution center for these species, with some *Dichaetomyia* populations being documented in its surrounding areas. Notably, **Maopu**, a village within Taichung’s Dali Township, has been identified as a type locality for certain *Dichaetomyia* species, underscoring the region’s importance in entomological research. However, one specific species, *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, is reported to be distributed in **Jiji**, a township in Nantou County, not Taichung itself. This clarification resolves a potential contradiction in the data, as Jiji is geographically distinct from Taichung. Overall, Taichung contributes to the broader understanding of *Dichaetomyia* biodiversity in Taiwan, with its localities like Maopu playing a key role in species identification and classification.
