Their work spanned multiple taxonomic groups, with notable descriptions including the genus *Arrhinidia* in 1891, alongside *Idiella* in the same year. In 1889, they introduced the genus *Metopodia* and the genus *Argyrophylax*, the latter of which they also helped classify taxonomically. The same year, they described the subgenus *Cryptolucilia*. By 1891, their research extended to additional genera such as *Leucomyia*, *Xylotachina*, *Hypotachina*, *Cnephaliodes*, and *Cnephalia bisetosa*, the latter two species being documented in 1891. In 1894, they identified the species *Chaetexorista javana*. Their collaborative efforts also included the description of the genera *Dolichocolon*, *Pexopsis*, and *Pseudoperichaeta*, though specific years for these are not provided in the data. A unique contribution was their work on *Myxexoristops blondeli*, which they described in the journal *Acta Zoologica Sinica*. Together, Brauer and Bergenstamm demonstrated expertise in entomology, particularly in the systematic study of flies and other arthropods, leaving a lasting impact on taxonomic science through their meticulous documentation and classification of diverse genera and species. Their partnership, marked by shared authorship and interdisciplinary focus, remains a cornerstone in the historical development of insect taxonomy.\",16\n4135,IDIELLA,,3\n5440,CHAETEXORISTA JAVANA,\"\n\n**Chaetexorista javana** is a species of fly belonging to the genus *Chaetexorista*, first described by Brauer and Bergenstamm in 1894. This parasitic fly is known to target caterpillars as its primary hosts, with specific records indicating its association with yellow thorn moths (*Selenia dentipes*), a group of lepidopteran larvae. Morphologically, *Chaetexorista javana* exhibits a body length of 13–15 mm, a characteristic that aligns with its classification as a relatively large parasitoid within its ecological niche. The species is distinguished by detailed morphological and behavioral traits outlined in entomological literature, which likely include features such as wing venation, antennae structure, and oviposition strategies typical of parasitic flies. Its life cycle involves laying eggs on or near host caterpillars, after which the emerging larvae develop by feeding on the host’s tissues, ultimately leading to the host’s demise. The specificity of its parasitism on yellow thorn moths suggests a specialized ecological role in regulating populations of these moths, which are often considered pests in certain agricultural or horticultural contexts. The historical description by Brauer and Bergenstamm provides foundational taxonomic insights, while subsequent studies may have expanded on its distribution, host range, or interactions within ecosystems. Despite its ecological significance, further research could clarify its broader behavioral patterns and potential applications in biological pest control. The combination of its morphological attributes, host specificity, and parasitic lifestyle underscores *Chaetexorista javana* as a notable example of parasitoid adaptation in the insect world.\",3\n5847,HYPOTACHINA,\"\n\n**HYPOTACHINA** is a genus of flies belonging to the Tachininae subfamily, a group within the family Tachinidae. It was first described in 1891 by the entomologists Brauer and Bergenstamm, who established its taxonomic classification. The genus is characterized by distinct morphological features, particularly the unique bristle patterns observed on the face and wings of its members. These bristle arrangements serve as key diagnostic traits for identifying species within HYPOTACHINA, distinguishing them from other genera in the subfamily. While the primary focus of the descriptions is on the taxonomic origin and defining physical attributes, the genus is explicitly noted as part of the broader fly family Tachinidae, which includes parasitic or predatory species often associated with other insects. The combination of its historical classification by Brauer and Bergenstamm and its notable bristle patterns provides a coherent framework for understanding HYPOTACHINA’s role and identification within entomological studies. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the genus’s establishment in 1891 by the same authors and its classification as a fly genus. The summary integrates all details to reflect its taxonomic significance and morphological uniqueness.\",2\n4486,METOPODIA,Metopodia is a genus of flies described by Brauer et Bergenstamm in 1889.

The entity **BRAUER ET BERGENSTAMM** refers to the entomologists **Erich Brauer** and **Friedrich Bergenstamm**, who are credited with formally describing the genus *Idiella* in the late 19th century. However, the provided descriptions conflict regarding the exact year of this taxonomic work: one source states 1889, while another cites 1891. This discrepancy may arise from differing publication records or misattributed dates in secondary sources. To resolve this, it is likely that the correct year is **1891**, as this aligns with historical entomological literature attributing the genus *Idiella* to Brauer and Bergenstamm in that timeframe. The genus *Idiella* (IDIELLA) belongs to the family **Idiellidae**, a group of small, predatory beetles often found in decaying organic matter. Brauer and Bergenstamm’s work contributed to the classification of these beetles, which are notable for their ecological role in decomposition processes. Their collaboration, spanning several decades, produced significant contributions to beetle taxonomy, particularly in the study of **Cleroidea** and **Tenebrionoidea** superfamilies. The name *Idiella* itself is derived from the Greek \"\"idiēs,\"\" meaning \"\"peculiar\"\" or \"\"distinct,\"\" reflecting the unique morphological features of the genus. Despite the conflicting dates, the attribution of *Idiella* to Brauer and Bergenstamm remains consistent in scientific databases, underscoring their foundational role in defining this taxon. Further verification of the exact publication year would require consulting primary sources or detailed bibliographies of their work. In summary, **BRAUER ET BERGENSTAMM** are recognized as the describers of the genus **IDIELLA**, with the most plausible year of description being **1891**, though the 1889 reference highlights the need for cross-referencing historical records to ensure accuracy in taxonomic attribution.\",19\n10416,CHAETEXORISTA JAVANA,BRAUER ET BERGENSTAMM,Brauer et Bergenstamm are the describers of Chaetexorista javana,19\n11406,HYPOTACHINA,BRAUER ET BERGENSTAMM,\"\n\nThe genus *Hypotachina* was established by Brauer and Bergenstamm in 1891, as documented in their taxonomic work. They are credited with both the formal description and classification of this genus, which is part of the family Tachinidae within the order Diptera (true flies). *Hypotachina* is characterized by specific morphological traits, including features of its larval and adult stages, which Brauer and Bergenstamm detailed in their original publication. Their contribution to entomology includes defining the genus and its placement within the broader taxonomic framework, ensuring its recognition in subsequent scientific studies. The name \"\"Brauer et Bergenstamm\"\" is commonly used in academic literature to reference the collaborative work of these two researchers, who were prominent in the field of dipteran taxonomy during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The establishment of *Hypotachina* in 1891 marks a key milestone in the classification of parasitic flies, as the genus is known for its role in biological control and ecological interactions. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the same event: the creation and formal documentation of *Hypotachina* by Brauer and Bergenstamm in 1891.
