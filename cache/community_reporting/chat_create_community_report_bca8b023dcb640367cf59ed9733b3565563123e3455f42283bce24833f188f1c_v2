It serves as a key habitat for multiple genera and species, including *Aplomyia*, *Bothria*, and *Zenillia*, as well as *Dichaetomyia bibax*, *Lucilia shenyangensis*, and the green flies *长叶绿蝇* (Chángyè Lǜyíng) and *太原绿蝇* (Tàiyuán Lǜyíng). The province is also home to species such as *Protocalliphora azurea*, *Protocalliphora chrysorrhoea*, and *Protocalliphora maruyamensis*, and acts as a domestic distribution location for *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) kobayashii*. Notably, Liaoning is a critical area for *Servaisia* species and hosts the large-tailed *巨尾阿丽蝇* (Jùwěi Ālìyíng) and *叉丽蝇* (Chā Lìyíng).  \n\nThe province documents multiple *Phaonia* species, including *Phaonia maculobambusa* and *Phaonia brunneipalpis*, as well as *Sinohylemya craspedodonta* and *Phorbia fascicularis*. Specific localities within Liaoning, such as Benxi and Daheishan, are highlighted as type localities for certain species, including *Rypellia sinensis* (type locality: Daheishan) and *三齿泉种蝇* (Sānchǐ Quánzhǒngyíng). Additionally, Liaoning is noted for the distribution of *1461灰粉狭颊寄蝇* (Huīfěn Xiájiá Jìyíng) and *1463灰腹狭颊寄蝇* (Huīfù Xiájiá Jìyng), along with *Atherigona yiwulushan*, *Exorista rossica*, *Helina fica*, and *Phallocheira minor*.  \n\nThe region supports multiple *Blaesoxipha* species and is a documented location for *Parasarcophaga (Jantia) crassipalpis* and *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) dux*. *蓝翠蝇* (Làncuìyíng), scientifically classified as *Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis*, is found in areas like Fushun, Beizhen, and Jin County. Liaoning is also a distribution site for the genus *斑麻蝇* (Bānmáyíng) and the *细鬃棘蝇群* (Xìzōng Jíyíngqún) species group. The province further hosts *银额阳蝇* (Yíné Yángyíng) and is the type locality for *长白山点池蝇* (Chángbáishān Diǎnchíyíng), with *绯胫纹蝇* (Fēijìng Wényíng) also documented there.  \n\nIn summary, Liaoning Province is a biologically rich area in northeastern China, recognized for its role as a distribution hub for numerous fly species across multiple genera. Its diverse ecosystems, including specific localities like Benxi, Daheishan, Fushun, Beizhen, and Jin County, contribute to the presence of both common and regionally significant insect populations. The province’s ecological importance is underscored by its association with type localities and the occurrence of species such as *Lucilia shenyangensis*, *Protocalliphora* spp., and *Neomyia timorensis*, among others.
