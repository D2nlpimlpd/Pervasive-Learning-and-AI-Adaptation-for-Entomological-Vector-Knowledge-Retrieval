The genus includes species such as *Sarcophaga calicifera* Boettcher, 1912, which is synonymous with *Pierretia (s.str.) villeneuvei*, and *Sarcophaga ostindicae*. Its type species is *MUSCA CARNARIA* (now *Sarcophaga carnaria*), a foundational reference for the genus. Morphologically, Sarcophaga species are notable for developed abdominal bristles, a wide male face (three times the eye width), and genitalia with a long phallus and paired membranous processes. These traits aid in distinguishing the genus from related groups. \n\nThe genus has been documented in various taxonomic studies, including a revision published in *Rev. d'Ent.*, 15: 189, and species like *Parasarcophaga (Liosarcophaga) kobayashii* have been referenced in the journal *Jan. Jour. Sanit. Zool.*, indicating its relevance in entomological research. Some species, such as *Sarcophaga calicifera*, are classified under subgenera like *Pierretia*, while others, like *Parasarcophaga kobayashii*, fall under *Liosarcophaga*, reflecting the complexity of its taxonomic structure. Despite these subgeneric groupings, all entities remain part of the broader Sarcophaga genus. \n\nThe data collectively highlight Sarcophaga’s role in both ecological and scientific contexts, with its species contributing to studies on fly taxonomy, morphology, and distribution. The inclusion of multiple species and subgeneric classifications underscores the genus’s diversity, while the emphasis on specific anatomical traits provides a framework for identification. No contradictions in the provided descriptions are evident, as they align on the genus’s classification, key species, and defining characteristics.
