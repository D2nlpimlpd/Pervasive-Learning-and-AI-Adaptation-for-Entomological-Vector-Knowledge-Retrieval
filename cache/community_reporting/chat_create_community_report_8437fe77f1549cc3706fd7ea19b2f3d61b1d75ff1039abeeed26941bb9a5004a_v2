The province is a key distribution area for several notable fly species, including **Atherigona reversura**, **Atherigona triglomerata**, **Eutrichota gigas** (with Tianmushan as its type locality), **Frontina laeta**, **Musca autumnalis**, **Musca convexifrons** (specifically in Tianmu Mountain), **Thecocarcelia parnarae**, **Thecocarcelia laticornis**, **Argyrophylax phoeda**, **Argyrophylax nigrotibialis**, and **Parasarcophaga albiceps**. Additionally, Zhejiang is home to **Servillia ardens**, **Tachina nupta**, **Tachina noctuarum**, **Exorista jugoslavica**, **Exorista larvarum**, **Enneastigma shanghaiensis**, **Syngamoptera chekiangensis** (type locality: Tianmu Mountain), and **1430筒须新怯寄蝇** and **1431家蚕追寄蝇**. The region also supports **Parasarcophaga idmais**, **Parasarcophaga polystylata**, **Parasarcophaga brevicornis**, **Parasarcophaga macroauriculata**, and **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, with Tianmu Mountain frequently cited as a critical habitat.  \n\nZhejiang’s biodiversity extends to genera such as **Adia**, **FLY GENUS**, **GENUFORCEPS SARCOPHAGA**, **Pegomya** (including *Pegomya spinulosa*, *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Pegomya pachura*, *Pegomya clavellata*, and *Pegomya lyrura*), **Gonia** (*G. chinensis*, *G. bimaculata*, *G. klapperichi*), **Meigenia** (*Meigenia grandigena* in Moganshan), **Sarcophaga**, **Timavia**, **Vibrissina Rondani**, and **Bessa**. Specific species like **Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis**, **Anthomyia illocata**, **Sarcorohdendorfia antilope**, **Sarcorohdendorfia mimobasalis**, **Brontaea tonitrui**, **Dasychira baibaran**, **Isomyia electa**, **Isomyia pichoni**, **Isomyia pseudolucilia**, **Stomorhina obsoleta**, **Bellardia menechmoides** (Beiyeyangdangshan), **Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri** (Tianmushan), and **Hyleorus elatus** and **Voria ruralis** are documented in the province. The genus **Pierreia** includes species like **1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly** and **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**, while **1431家蚕追寄蝇** and **1430筒须新怯寄蝇** are also present.  \n\nZhejiang’s ecological significance is underscored by its association with host species such as the **rice leaf roller** (*Cnaphalocrocis medinalis*), which supports the distribution of **Shuangban Jiewei Jiying**. The province is further notable for the presence of **半透璃蝇** (semi-transparent flies), **棕尾别麻蝇** (fuscicaudal flies), **虎爪亚麻蝇** (tiger-clawed flies), **秉氏亚麻蝇** (Bing’s flies), and **义乌亚麻蝇** (Yiwu flies), alongside **蓝黑栉寄蝇** (*Pales pavida*), **炭黑栉寄蝇** (*Pales carbonata*), and **Sisyropa prominens**. **Dinemomyia nigribasicosta**, **Carcelia matsukarehae**, **Carcelia ambigua**, **Carcelia kockiana**, **Rhyncomya setipyga**, and **THICK RING BLACK FLY** (Tianmushan, Beiyandangshan) are also recorded.

Zhejiang, located in eastern China, is known for its diverse ecosystems and agricultural significance, particularly in rice cultivation. HE JUNHUA’s connection to the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens suggests involvement in biological or ecological research, potentially related to plant or insect species native to the region. These specimens may represent a specific group of organisms or a research project focused on biodiversity, conservation, or agricultural pests.  \n\nAdditionally, HE JUNHUA’s association with the Rice Leafroller Moth in Zhejiang highlights their role in addressing a critical agricultural pest that threatens rice crops. The Rice Leafroller Moth is a significant insect in rice-growing areas, as its larvae feed on rice leaves, causing damage that reduces yields. Research on this species in Zhejiang likely centers on monitoring its population, understanding its life cycle, or developing pest management strategies to mitigate its impact on local agriculture. This work aligns with broader efforts in the province to sustain rice production, a staple of Zhejiang’s economy and food security.  \n\nWhile the descriptions do not explicitly clarify the relationship between the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens and the Rice Leafroller Moth, both associations underscore HE JUNHUA’s engagement with Zhejiang’s ecological and agricultural systems. The lack of direct overlap between the two topics implies that HE JUNHUA may contribute to multiple areas of study within the region, such as biodiversity documentation and pest control. Zhejiang’s role as a hub for both natural and agricultural research further contextualizes these associations, as the province supports initiatives to balance ecological preservation with sustainable farming practices.  \n\nIn summary, HE JUNHUA is linked to Zhejiang through their work on the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens and the Rice Leafroller Moth, reflecting a dual focus on regional biodiversity and agricultural challenges. Their contributions likely support scientific understanding and practical solutions for Zhejiang’s ecosystems and rice industry, though the exact nature of their research on the specimens remains unspecified.
