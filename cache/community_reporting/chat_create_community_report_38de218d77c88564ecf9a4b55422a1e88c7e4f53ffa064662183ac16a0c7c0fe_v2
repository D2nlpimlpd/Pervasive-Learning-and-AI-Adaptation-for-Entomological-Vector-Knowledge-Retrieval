Its distribution spans multiple regions: it is found in **Xinjiang, China**, as well as **Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan, and other international locations**. The discrepancy in the description year (1902 vs. 1918) may reflect a later revision or clarification of the species by Stein, though the 1902 date is explicitly tied to its initial description. The abdominal features are described as \"\"markings\"\" in one account and \"\"yellow segments\"\" in another, suggesting that the yellow coloration is a key part of the abdominal pattern. Illustrations of the species were provided by Hennig in 1952, aiding in its taxonomic identification. Despite variations in the details across sources, the core attributes of long antennae, yellow abdominal segments, and a geographic range encompassing East and Southeast Asia remain consistent.

PETERSB.,\"\n\nThe *Annals of the Zoological Museum of Petersburg* (abbreviated as **ANN. MUS. ZOOL. PETERSB**) is a scientific journal associated with the Zoological Museum of Petersburg, serving as a publication platform for taxonomic and entomological research. It has documented the descriptions of multiple species, including **Pegomya aniseta**, which was described in 1907 by the entomologist Stein. Similarly, **Sinochirosia variegata** was originally described in the same journal by Stein in 1907, highlighting its role in early 20th-century dipteran taxonomy. The journal also features **Delia angustissima**, a species documented within its pages, though the specific year or author for this entry is not provided in the data. Additionally, it has published the description of **瘦叶近脉花蝇** (a species name in Chinese, likely referring to a specific fly species, though the English translation is not included in the data). \n\nThe journal’s contributions span diverse taxa, with a focus on dipterous insects (flies), as evidenced by the inclusion of species from genera such as *Pegomya*, *Sinochirosia*, and *Delia*. Stein’s work in 1907 is particularly notable, as he described both *Pegomya aniseta* and *Sinochirosia variegata* in the journal, underscoring its historical significance in entomological studies. While the data does not specify the exact years for all species (e.g., *Delia angustissima* and *瘦叶近脉花蝇*), it confirms the journal’s role as a repository for zoological discoveries, particularly in the field of insect classification. The full name of the journal, *Annals of the Zoological Museum of Petersburg*, aligns with its function as a formal scientific record, likely reflecting the museum’s research output. \n\nThe entity **ANN. MUS. ZOOL. PETERSB** is thus a key reference for taxonomic work, especially for species described in the early 1900s. Its documentation of *Pegomya aniseta* and *Sinochirosia variegata* by Stein in 1907, along with other species like *Delia angustissima* and *瘦叶近脉花蝇*, establishes it as a foundational publication in zoology. The journal’s focus on museum-based research and its historical role in describing new species make it a critical resource for understanding the biodiversity and classification of insects, particularly in regions connected to the Zoological Museum of Petersburg. Contradictions in the data (e.g., variations in the journal’s name as \"\"Annals\"\" vs. \"\"Annual\"\") are resolved by treating them as alternative references to the same publication, emphasizing its consistent use in scientific literature. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",3\n312,HENNIG,,65\n3214,HELINA NUDIFEMORATA,,6\n1463,PEGOMYA VALGENOVENSIS,\"A species of Pegomya fly with yellow axillary scales, lower axillary scales nearly twice as long as upper ones; fifth abdominal plate lateral lobes short.
