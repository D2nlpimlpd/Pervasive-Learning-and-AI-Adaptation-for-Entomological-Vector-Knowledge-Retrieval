Many of these species were documented in *Acta Zoologica Sinica*, a prominent Chinese zoological journal.  \n\nMA also collaborated on species descriptions for other genera. They co-described *Lispe monochaita* and *Lispe argenteiceps* (with Mou), *Emmesomyia megastigmata* and *Emmesomyia subvillica*, *Pegomya crinisternita*, and *Calliphora (Acrophaga) chinghaiensis* (青海丽蝇). In 1984, they contributed to the description of *Pegohylemyia acudepressa* (尖扁泉种蝇) and *Spilogona litorea yaluensis* and *Spilogona taheensis* as subspecies. Additionally, MA described *Hydrotaea nudispinosa* (1988) and co-described *Hydrotaea mimopilipes* with Zhao.

Additionally, *Phaonia luteovittata* is connected to Mudanjiang, suggesting the city's ecological or geographical relevance to this species. A third association with *Phaonia mimopalpata* further underscores Mudanjiang's role as a site of entomological interest, where these specific fly species have been observed or recorded. While the descriptions do not elaborate on the nature of these associations (e.g., habitat, research, or biodiversity significance), they collectively highlight Mudanjiang as a location with documented ties to three distinct *Phaonia* species. The city’s placement in Heilongjiang Province, a region known for its cold temperate climate and diverse ecosystems, may contribute to the presence of these species, though further details on their ecological roles or interactions in the area are not provided. The repeated mention of *Phaonia* species in the context of Mudanjiang implies that the city could be a focal point for studies on these insects, potentially related to their distribution, behavior, or conservation in northeastern China.

Additionally, Linjiang is home to the **Caesar Greenbottle Fly**, a species whose presence in the region underscores the area’s ecological relevance for studying diverse fly populations. Both *Phaonia yaluensis* and the Caesar Greenbottle Fly are associated with Linjiang, highlighting its role as a hub for documenting and understanding local biodiversity, particularly within the order Diptera. The convergence of these two species in the same locality suggests that Linjiang’s environment supports a range of insect life, making it a focal point for scientific investigations into their habitats, behaviors, and evolutionary contexts.\",2\n690,CHINESE ECONOMIC INSECT MONOGRAPHS,The Chinese Economic Insects Series is a publication where Acrostilpna montana was documented by Ma in 1988,1\n692,XINBIN GANGSHAN FOREST FARM,\"\n\nXinbin Gangshan Forest Farm, located in Liaoning province, China, is a significant ecological and taxonomic site.

Additionally, the farm is noted as a **distribution site** for *Acrostilpna montana*, another species found in the region. These associations highlight Xinbin Gangshan Forest Farm’s role in biodiversity research and conservation, particularly for species native to or dependent on the local forest ecosystems. The farm’s environment likely supports the habitats required for both species, contributing to their presence and study in the area. While the descriptions emphasize distinct taxonomic roles for the two species, they collectively affirm the farm’s ecological relevance in Liaoning. Its designation as a type locality for *Meliniella sikisima* and as a distribution point for *Acrostilpna montana* positions it as a key reference for entomological and botanical studies in the region. The farm’s natural setting, possibly characterized by temperate forests or specific microhabitats, may provide critical conditions for these species’ survival and proliferation. This dual significance—serving as both a foundational site for species identification and a habitat for existing populations—underscores the importance of preserving and studying Xinbin Gangshan Forest Farm to advance understanding of local biodiversity. The information from both descriptions aligns to present a cohesive picture of the farm’s scientific value, with no contradictions to resolve. Its role in supporting these species reflects broader ecological dynamics in Liaoning’s forests, making it a focal point for researchers and conservationists.\",1\n1122,VAN,\"\n\nVAN is a researcher associated with the co-description of two distinct species in the field of entomology. In 1980, VAN collaborated with Fan and Ma to describe *瘦叶近脉花蝇* (a species of fly, likely related to the genus *Protoplasmodium* or a similar group, though the exact taxonomic classification is not specified in the provided data). This contribution highlights VAN’s involvement in taxonomic work, particularly in documenting biodiversity within dipteran insects. Additionally, VAN is listed as a co-author of the species *青海丽蝇* (*Calliphora (Acrophaga) chinghaiensis*), a blowfly species belonging to the genus *Calliphora* and subgenus *Acrophaga*. The description of *Calliphora (Acrophaga) chinghaiensis* further underscores VAN’s expertise in forensic or ecological entomology, as blowflies are often studied for their roles in decomposition processes or as indicators of environmental conditions. While the first description explicitly notes the 1980 collaboration, the second does not specify a publication date, leaving the timeline of this latter contribution unclear. Both works, however, reflect VAN’s role in advancing the understanding of fly species, particularly in regions such as China, where *青海丽蝇* is likely endemic. The lack of additional details about VAN’s broader research or institutional affiliations in the provided data limits a more comprehensive overview, but the two co-authored species descriptions establish a clear connection to taxonomic studies in dipterology. The collaboration with Fan and Ma appears to be a recurring partnership, suggesting a shared focus on entomological research during the period of these publications. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they reference separate species and contexts. VAN’s contributions, though limited to these two examples in the given data, demonstrate a commitment to documenting and classifying insect biodiversity.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1524,瘦叶近脉花蝇,FAN,FAN co-described the species 瘦叶近脉花蝇 with VAN and MA in 1980,301\n2891,QINGHAI,HYDROTAEA NUDISPINOSA,\"Hydrotaea nudispinosa is found in Qinghai, China\",154\n6042,MA,PHANOIA JILINENSIS,Ma is the co-author of the Phaonia jilinensis species description,87\n680,ACROSTILPNA MONTANA,MA,Ma described Acrostilpna montana in 1988,85\n1164,MA,INSECT RESEARCH,\"Ma is a co-author of Delia latissima, which is described in 昆虫学研究\",85\n2526,类项圈厕蝇,MA,Ma described the species 类项圈厕蝇 in 1981,85\n3113,\"MEM,NAT,SCI,MUS.,TOKYO\",MA,\"Ma co-authored the description of Megophyra biseta in the memoirs\nMa co-authored the description of Megophyra subpenicillata in the memoirs\",84\n5180,COENOSIA HIRSUTILOBA,MA,Ma described Coenosia hirsutiloba in 1981,84\n5956,MA,PHAONIA AUREOLICAUDA,Ma co-described Phaonia aureolicauda with Wu,84\n5561,MA,折脉阳蝇,Ma is the author who described the species 折脉阳蝇,83\n6304,MA,ACTA ZOOL.SINICA,\"Ma co-authored Phaonia ningxiaensis, Phaonia jagedaqiensis, and Phaonia xingxianensis in this journal\",83\n2913,MA,HYDROTAEA MIMOPILIPES,Ma is a co-describer of Hydrotaea mimopilipes with Zhao,82\n6270,MA,ZHANGYE,MA's species is associated with Zhangye,82\n6354,LIAONING PROVINCIAL HEALTH AND EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,YALUENSIS PHANOIA,The station preserves type specimens of Phaonia yaluensis,20\n6975,昆虫学报,青海丽蝇CALLIPHORA (ACROPHAGA) CHINGHAIENSIS,The Chinese Journal of Entomology documents the species 青海丽蝇,20\n6057,MUDANJIANG,PHANOIA JILINENSIS,Mudanjiang is associated with Phaonia jilinensis,7\n6388,LINJIANG,YALUENSIS PHANOIA,Linjiang is the type locality of Phaonia yaluensis,7\n681,ACROSTILPNA MONTANA,CHINESE ECONOMIC INSECT MONOGRAPHS,The Chinese Economic Insects Series documented Acrostilpna montana,5\n683,ACROSTILPNA MONTANA,XINBIN GANGSHAN FOREST FARM,Xinbin Gangshan Forest Farm is a distribution site for Acrostilpna montana,5\n6977,VAN,青海丽蝇CALLIPHORA (ACROPHAGA) CHINGHAIENSIS,Van is a co-author of the species 青海丽蝇,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
