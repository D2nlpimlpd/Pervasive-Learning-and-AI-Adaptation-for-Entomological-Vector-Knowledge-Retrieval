He is most prominently associated with the species *毛腹绿蝇* (Lucilia pilosa Baranoff, 1933), a greenbottle fly he described in 1933. This species, part of the genus *Lucilia*, is notable for its ecological and forensic significance, as blow flies are often used in postmortem interval estimation.  \n\nIn addition to species-level work, Baranoff described the subgenus *Prosballia*, which has been later synonymized with the genus *Pierretia*. This indicates his role in organizing and classifying taxonomic hierarchies, though the exact relationship between *Prosballia* and *Pierretia* remains a point of historical taxonomic discussion. His synonymy proposal for *Prosballia* under *Pierretia* reflects his efforts to refine nomenclatural clarity within the field.  \n\nBaranoff also contributed to the description of *Chaetexorista eutachinoides* in 1932, a species within the genus *Chaetexorista*. This work further demonstrates his expertise in dipteran taxonomy and his engagement with diverse fly groups. His publications from the 1930s highlight his focus on morphological and systematic studies, which were foundational for understanding the classification of these insects during that era.  \n\nWhile the descriptions provided do not clarify whether Baranoff worked on other genera or species beyond those explicitly mentioned, his documented contributions to *Lucilia pilosa*, *Chaetexorista eutachinoides*, and the taxonomic framework of *Prosballia*/*Pierretia* underscore his role as a key figure in early 20th-century entomology. The apparent contradiction between the subgenus *Prosballia* and its synonymy with *Pierretia* is resolved by noting that Baranoff initially proposed *Prosballia* as a subgenus, which was later reclassified as a synonym of the genus *Pierretia* by subsequent researchers. This aligns with standard taxonomic practices where classifications evolve based on new evidence or consensus.  \n\nOverall, BARANOFF’s work remains relevant in entomological literature, particularly for his descriptions of species and subgeneric classifications that have informed ongoing studies of fly biodiversity and systematics. His 1932 and 1933 publications are cited in modern references, illustrating the lasting impact of his research.\",3\n5044,PROSBALLIA,\"Prosballia is a subgenus of Sarcophaga, characterized by elongated, sclerotized lateral processes and exposed epandrium and median process.
