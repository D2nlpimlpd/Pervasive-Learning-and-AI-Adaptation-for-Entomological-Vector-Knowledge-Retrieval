The country also hosts **Polleniopsis dalatensis**, for which it serves as the type locality in some references, and **Chrysomya pinguis** and **Chrysomya bezziana**. Additionally, Vietnam is a distribution site for **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**, **Achoetandrus rufifacies** (specifically in Heping), **Bengalia species**, **Ceylonomyia nigripes**, and **Ophyra spinigera**, the latter of which is found internationally within the country.  \n\nVietnam’s biodiversity includes the **greenbottle fly *Neomyia fletcheri*** and is the type locality for *Neomyia* species, indicating its role in the taxonomic origin of these flies. The genus **Onesia** and species **I. divisa** and **I. mandarina** are also documented there. Cosmina species such as **Cosmina bicolor** and **Cosmina limbipennis** are present, with the latter noted as being found internationally in Vietnam. The **THICK RING BLACK FLY** is another species with foreign distribution records in the country.  \n\nFurther, Vietnam is home to **Hemipyrellia ligurriens** and **Meigenia majuscula**, while the **Yunnan Sericomyia** (云南亚麻蝇) is reported as a foreign distribution site. The country’s ecological significance is underscored by its role as a distribution area for multiple fly genera and species, including general references to \"\"the fly species\"\" and \"\"the species\"\" being found or distributed there. Notably, Vietnam’s status as a type locality for certain species highlights its importance in entomological research.  \n\nThis summary consolidates Vietnam’s role as a key location for diverse fly species, emphasizing both its local and international ecological contributions. The repeated mentions of distribution and type locality confirm its prominence in the habitats of these insects, though specific details about interactions or ecological impacts remain unexplored in the provided data. The inclusion of both native and foreign distribution records reflects Vietnam’s position as a crossroads for fly populations, likely influenced by its tropical climate and varied ecosystems.\",20\n4016,\"MALLOCH, 1927\",Study published in 1927 by Malloch on the fly species,13\n4236,BORBORORHINA BIVITTATA,\"A species of fly described by Walker in 1857, later classified under Borbororhina.

The nation serves as a habitat for several notable genera and species, including *Bengalia*, *Borbororhina bivittata* (correcting the likely typo in \"\"Borbororhinia bivittata\"\"), *Halydaia*, *Linnaemya*, and *Isomyia*. Within the *Isomyia* genus, three species—*Isomyia isomyia*, *Isomyia viridaurea*, and *Isomyia nebulosa*—are specifically documented in Laos, alongside *Isomyia cupreoviridis*, which is also found internationally. Additionally, the Indian greenbottle fly (*Chlororhinia exempta*), a species known for its ecological and forensic relevance, is present in the country.  \n\nLaos is further associated with the distribution of *Hemipyrellia ligurriens*, a fly species noted in the Indo-China Peninsula, and *Haematobiosa austeni*, which contributes to the region’s biodiversity. The descriptions collectively emphasize Laos as a key location for these species, with some, like *Borbororhina bivittata* and *Halydaia*, being explicitly tied to the country. While general references to \"\"the fly species\"\" and \"\"the species\"\" in Laos are included, the specific examples provided highlight its role in supporting both regionally endemic and internationally distributed fly populations.  \n\nThe data underscores Laos’ importance in entomological studies, particularly for dipteran species that may have implications for ecology, public health, or forensic science. Despite minor ambiguities in some descriptions (e.g., \"\"the species is distributed\"\"), the repeated mentions of specific genera and species confirm their presence in the country. This synthesis resolves potential contradictions by prioritizing the most detailed and consistent entries, ensuring a coherent overview of Laos’ entomological profile.  \n\nIn conclusion, Laos is a Southeast Asian nation on the Indo-China Peninsula where multiple fly species, including *Bengalia*, *Borbororhina bivittata*, *Halydaia*, *Linnaemya*, *Isomyia* (with four subspecies), *Chlororhinia exempta*, *Hemipyrellia ligurriens*, and *Haematobiosa austeni*, are documented.

Additionally, the county is a known location for *Borbororhina bivittata*, another species whose presence in the region has been documented. These two species, while distinct in their biological classifications, are both associated with MENG LA’s environment, highlighting the area’s role in supporting diverse fauna. The descriptions provided consistently identify MENG LA as a site in Yunnan where these species occur, with no direct contradictions in the data. The county’s inclusion in the context of both domestic and regional species distribution underscores its ecological importance. Further details about the specific habitats, conservation status, or interactions between these species in MENG LA are not included in the provided data, but the information collectively establishes the location as a key area for the presence of *Cosmina limbipennis* and *Borbororhina bivittata*.
