For instance, *Limnophora purgata* and *Limnophora parastylata* are both found in Dayugou, a location within Benxi [Data: Relationships (4865, 2581, 12035)]. Additionally, *Bellardia benshiensis* is associated with Benxi as its type locality [Data: Entities (3799)]. The city's role in the study and documentation of these species is significant, as it is also the location of the Benxi Health and Epidemic Prevention Station, which conducted surveys on fly larvae in 1965 [Data: Relationships (12035)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Xue's contributions to the description of fly species\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Xue is a key figure in the entomological community, having described several fly species found in Benxi.
