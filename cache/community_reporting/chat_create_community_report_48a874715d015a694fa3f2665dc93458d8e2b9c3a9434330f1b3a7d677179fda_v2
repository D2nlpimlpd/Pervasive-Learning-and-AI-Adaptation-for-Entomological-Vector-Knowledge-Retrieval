The type species of the genus is *Muscina stabulans*, which serves as the foundational reference for its classification. Primarily distributed across the Palaearctic region, some species within the genus exhibit a more global range. The genus encompasses subgenera like *Pararicia* and includes notable species such as *Muscina pascuroum* and *Muscina assimilis*. \n\nLarvae of *Muscina* are predatory, feeding on other Diptera larvae, and are known to transmit intestinal diseases, highlighting their ecological and medical significance. Adult *Muscina* flies demonstrate adaptability to seasonal changes, as evidenced by their ability to overwinter in regions like Shanghai, a trait that may contribute to their persistence in temperate climates. The inclusion of *M. assimilis* in the second description expands the known species diversity of the genus, though specific details about its morphology or behavior are not provided. Overall, *Muscina* is a taxonomically and ecologically diverse group within the fly family, with roles as both predators and potential disease vectors.\",21\n1721,ROBINEAU-DESVIOY,\"\n\n**Robineau-Desvoidy** was a notable French entomologist and taxonomist active in the 19th century. He is best known for his contributions to the classification of dipteran insects (flies). In 1830, Robineau-Desvoidy described the species *Gonia picea*, a significant taxonomic act that added to the understanding of insect biodiversity during that period. The same year, he also established the genus *Muscina*, which is part of the family Muscidae, further demonstrating his expertise in systematizing fly taxonomy. These two achievements—describing *Gonia picea* and defining the genus *Muscina*—highlight his role in advancing entomological science through detailed morphological analysis and nomenclatural work. His efforts in 1830 remain foundational in the study of these insect groups, with both the species and genus names still recognized in modern taxonomic literature. Robineau-Desvoidy’s work reflects the broader scientific endeavors of the 19th century to catalog and categorize the natural world, particularly in the field of arthropod classification.\",2\n5609,GONIA PICEA,\"Gonia picea is a species of fly described by Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830, found in domestic regions including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Beijing, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Tibet, as well as internationally in Europe\",11\n869,WEST ASIA,\"\n\nWest Asia is a region known for the distribution of several fly species, including *Hylemya vagans*, *Lispe caesia*, and members of the *Muscina* genus. These species are part of the broader entomological diversity found in the area, which spans countries such as Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. *Hylemya vagans*, a species of fly, is specifically documented to inhabit this region, contributing to its ecological profile. Similarly, *Lispe caesia*, another fly species, is also reported to be present in West Asia, further highlighting the area's role as a habitat for diverse dipteran fauna. The *Muscina* genus, which includes multiple species, is noted for its distribution in the region, underscoring West Asia's significance as a center for the presence of these flies. Collectively, these findings emphasize the region's ecological importance in supporting a range of fly species, which may play roles in local ecosystems, such as decomposition or pollination.
