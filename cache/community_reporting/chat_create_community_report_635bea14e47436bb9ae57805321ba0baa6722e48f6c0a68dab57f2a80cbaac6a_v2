Contrary to a conflicting description that incorrectly identifies it as a city, Mogansan is a natural landscape characterized by lush bamboo forests, scenic valleys, and a subtropical climate, making it a notable tourist destination and a hub for environmental research. The area is part of the documented distribution range for two species of flies: *Isomyia pichoni* and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, which are likely associated with the region’s specific habitats, such as its dense vegetation or microclimates. Additionally, Mogansan has been modeled as a key location for *Pegomya japonica mokanensis*, a subspecies of the Pegomya fly, further underscoring its role in entomological studies. These species, all within the family of flies (Diptera), highlight the region’s importance as a biodiversity hotspot, particularly for insects that may rely on the unique ecological conditions of the mountain. The discrepancies in the data—such as the misclassification of Mogansan as a city—are resolved by confirming its status as a geographic and ecological site rather than an urban center. Its inclusion in species distribution models and records reflects its value in understanding the biogeography and habitat preferences of these organisms. Overall, Mogansan serves as a critical reference point in studies related to Zhejiang’s natural ecosystems and the distribution of specialized insect species.\",2\n4307,伪绿等彩蝇,\"A species of fly in the genus Isomyia, described by Malloch in 1928, with a body length of 8-11 mm and a distribution in Anhui, Zhejiang, Sichuan (E'mei Mountain, the type locality), Hunan, and other regions\",15\n4160,HUANGSHAN,\"\n\n**HUANGSHAN** is a city located in Anhui Province, China, renowned for its scenic beauty and cultural significance. It is home to the iconic Huangshan Mountains (Yellow Mountains), a UNESCO World Heritage Site celebrated for its unique granite peaks, ancient pine trees, and cloud-filled valleys. The region is a major tourist destination and a symbol of Chinese natural heritage.  \n\nThe species **Isomyia pseudolucilia**, a type of fly, is reported to have a distribution that includes a location in Zhejiang Province, China. However, this reference to Zhejiang appears to be a separate geographical note and does not align with the established location of the city of Huangshan, which is firmly in Anhui. While the city of Huangshan is associated with biodiversity due to its mountainous ecosystem, the specific mention of Zhejiang in the context of *Isomyia pseudolucilia* likely refers to a different area within the species’ range.  \n\nIn summary, **HUANGSHAN** is a city in Anhui Province, famed for its natural landscapes and the Huangshan Mountains. The species *Isomyia pseudolucilia* is documented in Zhejiang Province, but this should not be conflated with the city of Huangshan itself. The two references highlight distinct geographical contexts, with the city’s location in Anhui and the species’ distribution extending to Zhejiang.
