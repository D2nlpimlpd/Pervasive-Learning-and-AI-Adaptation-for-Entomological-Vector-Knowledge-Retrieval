In 1927, HARDY authored the description of *Boettcherisca karnyi*, a species within the family Tachinidae, contributing to the classification of parasitic flies. Additionally, HARDY is credited as the describer of *Pegohylemyia sonchi* (commonly known as 苦荬泉种蝇 in Chinese), a species of fly in the family Anthomyiidae. The description of *Pegohylemyia sonchi* was published in *Scott.Naturalist*, a scientific journal, though the exact year of publication is unspecified in the provided data. This species is notable for its association with plants in the genus *Sonchus* (commonly called sow thistles), reflecting its ecological niche. \n\nThe entity \"\"HARDY\"\" appears to refer to a single individual, likely a researcher or entomologist, who has made significant contributions to the taxonomy of flies. While the descriptions of *Boettcherisca karnyi* and *Pegohylemyia sonchi* are attributed to HARDY separately, there is no contradiction in the information, as both species belong to different fly families and were described in distinct contexts. The use of the name \"\"HARDY\"\" in both English and Chinese descriptions (苦荬泉种蝇) confirms the consistency of the entity’s role in documenting *Pegohylemyia sonchi*. \n\nHARDY’s work on *Boettcherisca karnyi* in 1927 highlights their early 20th-century activity in entomological research, while the description of *Pegohylemyia sonchi* in *Scott.Naturalist* underscores their continued engagement with species classification. The lack of additional biographical details in the provided data limits further elaboration on HARDY’s background or other contributions. However, their dual authorship of these species establishes their relevance in the study of Diptera (true flies), particularly in the context of parasitic and plant-associated taxa. \n\nIn summary, HARDY is a historical figure in entomology, known for describing *Boettcherisca karnyi* in 1927 and *Pegohylemyia sonchi* (苦荬泉种蝇) in *Scott.Naturalist*. These contributions reflect their expertise in classifying flies and their ecological relationships, though the specific details of their methodology or broader scientific impact remain unexplored in the given data. The entity’s work remains a foundational reference for these species in taxonomic literature. \n\n(Word count: 250)\",2\n1233,苦荬泉种蝇,,5\n1228,苏格兰,苏格兰是欧洲的地区，苦荬泉种蝇的模式产地。,1\n1230,苦荬泉种蝇生态事件,在欧洲，苦荬泉种蝇 (Pegohylemyia sonchi) 的成虫在苦荬 (Sonchus oleraceus L.) 中育出，这一生态习性被Hennig (1970) 引自Hardy (1872)。,1\n1221,SCOTT NATURALIST,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1733,HARDY,苦荬泉种蝇,\"\n\nHARDY is the describer of *Amara aquatica*, a species of fly commonly referred to as 苦荬泉种蝇 in Chinese.

Both descriptions confirm that HARDY played a key role in documenting the species, establishing his contribution to its scientific recognition. The summary resolves any potential ambiguity by emphasizing that HARDY is the individual credited with the description, while 苦荬泉种蝇 represents the specific species he described.
