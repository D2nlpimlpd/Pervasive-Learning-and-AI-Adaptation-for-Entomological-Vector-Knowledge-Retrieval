It is a region where several notable species are found or associated. The species *Borbororhina bivittata* is documented as occurring in Sarawak, contributing to its entomological diversity. Additionally, the region is linked to *Musca asiatica*, a fly species native to Borneo, and *Chlororhinia exempta*, a dipteran insect whose presence in the state underscores its varied habitats. Sarawak also serves as the type locality for *Anthomyia illocata*, meaning the species was first described based on specimens collected there. Furthermore, the state is a known distribution area for *Metalliopsis setosa*, a plant or animal species (context unclear from data) that thrives in its ecosystems.  \n\nThe data clarifies that Sarawak is a state, not a city, resolving a minor contradiction in the description list. As a key part of Borneo, it supports diverse flora and fauna, with the listed species reflecting its role as a biodiversity hotspot. The inclusion of both insect and potential plant species highlights the region’s ecological complexity, though the exact classification of *Metalliopsis setosa* remains unspecified in the provided information. Overall, Sarawak’s status as a Malaysian state in Borneo is central to understanding the geographic context of these species, which are either native to or have significant taxonomic ties to the area.

It is home to the regions of **Sabah** and **Sarawak**, which are states within Malaysia, as well as the Indonesian provinces of Kalimantan and the Sultanate of Brunei. The island is renowned for its rich biodiversity and serves as a critical habitat for numerous species. Among these, **Pectiniseta pectinata**, a species of fly, is documented as being distributed in Borneo. Additionally, the island hosts **Anthomyia plumiseta** and **Anthomyia illocata**, two other fly species that are part of its ecological diversity. These species, along with the broader array of flora and fauna, highlight Borneo’s significance as a biologically unique region. The descriptions provided collectively emphasize Borneo’s role as both a geographic entity (an island) and a regional hub for specific ecological studies, with its distribution patterns of these species underscoring its importance in entomological research. The mention of Sabah and Sarawak as cities in one description is corrected to reflect their accurate status as states within Malaysia, aligning with the other references to Borneo as an island and region. This synthesis ensures a coherent portrayal of Borneo’s geographic and biological attributes.\",4\n2108,SABAH,\"\n\n**SABAH** is a state in Malaysia located on the northern portion of the island of Borneo. It is recognized as a significant geographic and ecological region, serving as a habitat for various species of insects and arthropods. Among these, **Myospila femorata**, a species of fly, is associated with Sabah, as is **Musca asiatica**, another fly species documented in the region. Additionally, **Haematostoma austeni**, a blood-sucking leech, is linked to Sabah as its type locality, meaning the species was first described based on specimens collected there. The state is also noted for the distribution of **Tainanina pilisquama**, a species of insect, and **Haematobiosa austeni**, a fly species that was first described in Sabah.  \n\nThe descriptions provided highlight Sabah’s role as a biodiversity hotspot, particularly for entomological and leech species. While one source incorrectly refers to Sabah as a \"\"city,\"\" this is resolved by confirming its status as a Malaysian state within Borneo. All references to Sabah as a region align with its geographical and administrative classification. The repeated mention of Sabah as a location for these species underscores its ecological importance in the study of such organisms. The inclusion of both flies and leeches suggests a diverse ecosystem, with habitats ranging from tropical forests to wetlands, which support these invertebrates.  \n\nIn summary, Sabah, a Malaysian state on Borneo, is a key region for the distribution and study of several insect and leech species, including *Myospila femorata*, *Musca asiatica*, *Tainanina pilisquama*, and *Haematobiosa austeni*, as well as the type locality for *Haematostoma austeni*. Its role in scientific documentation and biodiversity conservation is evident through these associations.
