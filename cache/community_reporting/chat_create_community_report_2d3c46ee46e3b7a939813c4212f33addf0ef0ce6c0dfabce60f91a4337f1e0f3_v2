The region is the type locality for *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* and *1341细角细麻蝇* (Fine-horned Small Tachinid Fly). Notable species with localized records include *Shuangban Jiewei Jiying* (Shandianba), *1254钝叶污蝇* and *1256黑须污蝇*, *异聚蜂麻蝇*, *多斑聚蜂麻蝇*, *华丽聚蜂麻蝇*, *肖瘤胫厕蝇*, *毛踝厕蝇*, and *1281毛股折麻蝇* (Hairy-thighed Tachinid Fly). \n\nResearch activities in Inner Mongolia include studies on host relationships of fly species and historical relocations of sericulturists during outbreaks of *Egle muscaria*.

Additionally, the species *Halina moedlingensis* is noted as being distributed in Poland, though this may represent a typographical variation of *Helina* (a genus in the family Muscidae) and requires further clarification. The country also hosts *Coenosia octopunctata* and *Coenosia flavicornis*, both members of the *Coenosia* genus, as well as *Haematobia titillans* (the horn fly) and *Musca larvipara* (a species of housefly). *Pollenia pectinata*, a blow fly, is similarly reported in Poland.

Furthermore, the genus *Helicophagella* is described as being distributed in Poland, though the term \"\"foreign country\"\" in this context may be an error, as all other descriptions explicitly reference Poland as the location. Finally, the data highlights that Poland is a country where at least one species exhibits international distribution, though the specific species is not named.
