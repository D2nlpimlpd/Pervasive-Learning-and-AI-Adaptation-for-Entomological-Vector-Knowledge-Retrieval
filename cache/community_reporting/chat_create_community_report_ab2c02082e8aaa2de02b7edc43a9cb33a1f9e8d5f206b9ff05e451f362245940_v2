His work spanned several decades, with notable activity in the mid-20th century. ZIMIN first described *Dasyphora asiatica* (肖瘤胫厕蝇) in 1945, a species later associated with ecological research. In 1947, he expanded his taxonomic work by describing additional *Dasyphora* species, including *Dasyphora trichosterna*. By 1951, ZIMIN’s expertise was evident in multiple publications: he described *Mesembrina montana* and *Mesembrina gracilior*, established the subgenus *Pyrelliomima*, and contributed to the description of *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca vitripennis*, *Musca osiris*, *Orthellia pacifica*, and *Neomyia laevifrons*. That same year, he also played a role in the ecological description of *Musca crassirostris* and was cited for illustrations of *Musca domestica* and *Graphomya maculata* (Figure 678). In 1954, ZIMIN described *Linnaemya zachvatkini* and *Pyrellia secunda* (双毛碧蝇), further solidifying his work on *Dasyphora* and related genera. Earlier, in 1929, he described *Servillia ardens*, and later in 1967 and 1980, he contributed to the taxonomy of *Tachina nigriventris* and *Tachina turanica*, respectively. Additionally, ZIMIN described *Schineria setinervis* in 1974 and *Musca amica* in 1954, the latter being a synonym for *Musca vitripennis*. His research also included the establishment of the subgenus *Dasysterna* in 1951. ZIMIN’s work was frequently referenced in illustrations and descriptions of other species, such as *Stomoxys calcitrans* and *Graphomya maculata*, highlighting his influence on visual and textual documentation in entomology. Despite the breadth of his contributions, the data does not clarify whether ZIMIN worked in a specific institution or region beyond his Chinese nationality. His career appears to have focused on both morphological taxonomy and ecological insights, with a particular emphasis on muscid and tachinid flies. The repeated mentions of 1951 as a pivotal year suggest it was a period of intense activity, during which he described multiple species, subgenera, and contributed to illustrations. ZIMIN’s legacy includes resolving taxonomic complexities, such as synonymizing *Musca amica* with *Musca vitripennis*, and advancing the understanding of fly biodiversity through meticulous descriptions and ecological observations.
