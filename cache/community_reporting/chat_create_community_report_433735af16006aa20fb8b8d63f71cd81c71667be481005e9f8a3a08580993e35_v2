The genus is characterized by distinct morphological features, including a black body covered in a grayish-white powder, as noted in one description. Taxonomically, it is identified by specific bristle arrangements on the mesotibia (three anterior dorsal bristles) and a single scutellar bristle, as well as unique wing venation ratios. These traits align with the broader classification of tachinid flies, which are known for their parasitic lifestyle, often targeting other insects. The species *Pseudoperichaeta nigrolineata* is explicitly mentioned as a member of this genus. The Chinese name for the genus, \"\"赛寄蝇属,\"\" is also provided, reflecting its recognition in non-English entomological literature. While the descriptions agree on the genus's tachinid classification and key morphological markers, they do not present contradictory information about its biology or taxonomy. The reproductive strategy of ovoviviparity—where eggs develop internally until hatching—is highlighted as a defining trait, underscoring its adaptation to parasitism. Overall, *Pseudoperichaeta* is a well-defined genus within the Tachinidae family, distinguished by its coloration, bristle patterns, and reproductive method.
