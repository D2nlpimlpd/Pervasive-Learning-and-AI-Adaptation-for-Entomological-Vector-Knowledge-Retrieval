It is a European country where the species *Helina quadrum* and *Helina longicornis* are distributed, contributing to its biodiversity. The country also serves as the type locality for *Strobilomyia laricicola* and *Strobilomyia anthracinum*, with the former specifically associated with the Alps region, highlighting Austria’s alpine ecosystems as critical for these species. Additionally, *Fannia leucosticta* has its type locality in Austria, underscoring the country’s significance in entomological taxonomy. \n\nAustria is further recognized as a distribution site for *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (a species likely identified by a numerical code or local name, possibly related to the genus *Fannia* or another fly group), as well as *Pegohylemyia sanctimarci*, which has been observed in the region by entomologist Marcus. The country also hosts *Phylloteles pictipennis* and *Coenosia octopunctata*, both of which are part of its broader insect fauna. Notably, some species, such as *Strobilomyia laricicola*, are described as having an international distribution with Austria as a key location, indicating the country’s ecological connectivity to other regions. \n\nThe descriptions collectively emphasize Austria’s role in both local and global entomological contexts, with its alpine and temperate habitats supporting a range of fly species. While most references align with Austria’s status as a European country, one description ambiguously states \"\"the species is found internationally\"\" without specifying the species, which is resolved here by including all explicitly named species. The inclusion of type localities (e.g., for *Strobilomyia* and *Fannia leucosticta*) reinforces Austria’s importance in scientific classification, while the mention of international distribution for certain species highlights its ecological relevance beyond national borders. Overall, Austria’s diverse environments, including the Alps, provide critical habitats for these insects, making it a focal point for entomological research and conservation.\",9\n1217,MARCUS,Individual who observed Pegohylemyia sanctimarci in Allium ursinum flowers in Austria,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5743,HELINA QUADRUM,FABRICIUS,Fabricius described the species Helina quadrum in 1805,33\n8667,PHYLLOTELES PICTIPENNIS,LOEW,Loew is the author of the species Phylloteles pictipennis,25\n576,AUSTRIA,STROBILOMYIA LARICICOLA,Strobilomyia laricicola is distributed in Austria,20\n1727,MARCUS,AUSTRIA,Marcus observed Pegohylemyia sanctimarci in Austria,10\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
