His work primarily focused on Diptera (true flies), with several key descriptions attributed to him. In 1882, he first described the species *Tachina albidopilosa* and *Bayan Wohlfahrtia*, the latter of which is associated with the genus *Wohlfahrtia*. By 1887, Portschinsky expanded his taxonomic efforts, describing the genus *Oestroderma* and its type species *Oestroderma potanini*. The same year, he also documented *Scathophaga amplipennis*, a species within the Scathophagidae family, and was credited as the first author to describe *Musca larvipara* (commonly known as the \"\"pregnant housefly\"\") in the journal *Zool. Anz. (Leipzig)*. This species, *Musca larvipara*, is now classified under the family Muscidae. Additionally, Portschinsky played a role in the 1902 description of the genus *Oestromyia*, though his specific contribution to this work is not detailed in the provided data. His research spanned multiple families of flies, including Oestromyidae, Scathophagidae, and Muscidae, and his publications in entomological journals helped establish foundational taxonomic records for these groups. Despite the diversity of his work, the descriptions provided do not indicate contradictions in his contributions, suggesting a consistent and multifaceted role in dipteran taxonomy. Portschinsky’s legacy includes the formal naming of species and genera that remain relevant in modern entomological studies.
