He is recognized as a co-author of a 1982 work focused on *Eudasyphora cyanicolor*, a species of insect, in the context of Chinese biodiversity or taxonomic research. This contribution highlights his involvement in entomological studies, particularly in documenting or analyzing the species within China’s ecological framework. His academic collaboration in this publication underscores his role in advancing scientific understanding of insect taxonomy or related fields during the early 1980s. While the specific details of the 1982 work are not elaborated, the association with the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Zoology suggests his research aligns with the institution’s broader goals in zoological and ecological sciences. Zhang’s work on *Eudasyphora cyanicolor* may have provided foundational insights into the species’ distribution, behavior, or classification in China, contributing to regional or global entomological databases. His affiliation with a leading scientific organization also implies access to extensive resources and networks, which likely supported his research endeavors. Overall, Zhang Xuezhong’s profile reflects a commitment to zoological and entomological research, with notable contributions to the study of *Eudasyphora cyanicolor* in China and institutional ties to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\",2\n131,中国科学院动物研究所,The Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Zoology is an organization associated with Zhang Xuezhong and Sun Leikui,2\n156,孙雷逵,Sun Leikui is affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Zoology,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n123,张学忠,中国科学院动物研究所,Zhang Xuezhong is affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Zoology,4\n124,中国科学院动物研究所,孙雷逵,Sun Leikui is affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Zoology,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
