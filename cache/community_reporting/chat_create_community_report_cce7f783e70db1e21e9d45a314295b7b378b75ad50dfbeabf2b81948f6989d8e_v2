This aligns with its designation as an \"\"international distribution location,\"\" a term used to denote its inclusion in global species records. The country is also reported as a site for **Musca larvipara**, a non-biting midge, which may have implications for public health or ecological interactions. Notably, **SHUANG YANGYING** is listed as a species distributed in Algeria, though the name appears to be a proper noun (possibly a misspelling or misclassification) and may require further taxonomic clarification.  \n\nThe **Helicophagella genus**, a group of flies, is confirmed to have a distribution in Algeria, adding to the country’s entomological diversity. Collectively, these references illustrate Algeria’s ecological importance as a region where various insect and arthropod species coexist, contributing to broader scientific understanding of their geographic ranges. The data does not present contradictions but rather reinforces Algeria’s role as a crossroads for multiple species, likely influenced by its Mediterranean climate, diverse landscapes, and adjacency to other North African and European regions. The mention of a taxonomic key for Sarcophagini further situates Algeria within a framework for identifying and classifying these organisms, highlighting its relevance to both regional and international biodiversity research.  \n\nIn summary, Algeria is a North African nation recognized for hosting a range of species, including **Lydella grisescens**, **Sarcophaga haematodes**, **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, **Miltogramma iberium**, **Musca larvipara**, **SHUANG YANGYING**, and the **Helicophagella genus**, as well as being part of a taxonomic reference system for Sarcophagini. These records underscore its ecological and scientific significance in the study of arthropod distribution and taxonomy.\",3\n4641,SOUTHWEST ASIA,\"\n\nSouthwest Asia is a geographical region in the Middle East and parts of Central Asia, encompassing countries such as Syria, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and others. It is recognized as a significant area for the distribution of certain species, including *Cephalopina titillator* and *Bercaea cruentata*. *Cephalopina titillator*, a species within the Cephalopina genus, is explicitly noted to inhabit this region, with Syria identified as its type locality—the specific location where the species was first described and documented. This highlights the ecological and taxonomic importance of Syria in the study of this organism. Meanwhile, *Bercaea cruentata* is also reported to be distributed in Southwest Asia, though no further details about its range or specific habitats within the region are provided. The term \"\"foreign region\"\" in one description likely refers to Southwest Asia being referenced in the context of species distribution outside of the speaker’s or writer’s primary area of focus, underscoring its role as a distinct biogeographic zone. Collectively, these descriptions emphasize Southwest Asia as a key area for the presence and study of these two species, with Syria playing a central role in the taxonomic history of *Cephalopina titillator*. The region’s biodiversity and ecological significance are further reinforced by its inclusion in the distribution ranges of both species, though additional research may be needed to clarify the specific habitats or conservation status of *Bercaea cruentata* in the area. The data aligns consistently, with no direct contradictions, to portray Southwest Asia as a relevant biogeographic entity for these species.\",2\n4643,NINGXIA REGIONAL EPIDEMIC PREVENTION STATION,The Ningxia Regional Epidemic Prevention Station conducted a survey on species in Ningxia,1\n2237,CZECHOSLOVAKIA,\"\n\nCzechoslovakia, a historical Central European country that existed from 1918 to 1992, is associated with the documentation and distribution of several notable species. The country served as the **type locality** for *Phaonia hybrida*, a fly species first described in the region, highlighting its significance in entomological taxonomy. Additionally, Czechoslovakia is reported as a location where *Musca larvipara*, a species of muscid fly, has been observed, contributing to its ecological and zoogeographical records. The region is also linked to the distribution of *Helina obscuratoides*, a fly species within the family Muscidae, and *Blaesoxipha lautaretensis*, a member of the family Tachinidae, both of which are noted to occur in its territory. Furthermore, the genus *Sinonipponia*, a group of flies in the family Tachinidae, is documented as being distributed in Czechoslovakia, underscoring the country's role in the biodiversity of parasitic flies. These associations reflect Czechoslovakia's historical importance as a hub for entomological research and its contribution to the understanding of dipteran species. The country’s varied ecosystems, including its temperate forests, alpine regions, and agricultural landscapes, likely supported the habitats of these species. Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, its successor states (the Czech Republic and Slovakia) continue to inherit these ecological legacies, though modern studies may now focus on the split regions separately. The data collectively emphasize Czechoslovakia’s role in the scientific description and geographic distribution of these specific fly species, with its historical records remaining relevant for taxonomic and biogeographical analyses. No contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as all consistently reference Czechoslovakia as a site of occurrence or origin for the listed species.\",3\n3313,PHAONIA AUREOLIMACULATA,,9\n4698,NORTHERN IRAN,Northern Iran is a region where Blaesoxipha litoralis is distributed.>,1\n1954,POLIETES HIRTICRURA,\"A species of fly described by Meade in 1887. Distributed in Mongolia, USSR (Siberia), UK, and USA (Alaska, Washington, New Hampshire).>\",7\n1794,MEADE,\"\n\nMEADE is a scientific author associated with the description of multiple species across different genera and years. According to the provided data, Meade is credited as the author of *Hydrotaea parva*, though no specific year is mentioned for this contribution. Additionally, Meade described the species *Polietes hirticrura* in 1887, a detail confirmed in two separate entries. In 1876, he is noted as the author of *Parasarcophaga similis*, and in 1887, he also described *Hydrotaea similis*. These records indicate that Meade worked on both the *Hydrotaea* and *Polietes* genera, as well as the *Parasarcophaga* genus, with his taxonomic contributions spanning at least two decades (1876–1887). The species *Polietes hirticrura* and *Hydrotaea similis* are both linked to 1887, suggesting a possible focus on related taxa during that year. While the descriptions of *Hydrotaea parva* and *Hydrotaea similis* refer to different species within the same genus, they are distinct and do not conflict. The data does not clarify whether Meade is a single individual or a collective name, but all entries consistently attribute these species to the entity \"\"MEADE\"\" without contradiction. His work appears to center on dipteran insects, given the genera involved, and his contributions to taxonomy are documented in scientific literature with specific dates for three of the four species. The summary consolidates all provided information into a cohesive account of Meade’s taxonomic activities, ensuring clarity and adherence to the third-person perspective.\",4\n3304,NEARCTIC REGION,A biogeographic region where species like Ph. rugia and Ph. subfuscinervis are distributed.,1\n5267,ENT.MITTEIL,Journal where Sarcophaga semenovi was first described,1\n1865,ZOLOGICAL MAGAZINE,\"Zoological Magazine published the description of Thricops semicinereus in issue 1, p.84\",1\n4768,CENTRAL TIANSHAN,\"\n\n**CENTRAL TIANSHAN** is a region located in Xinjiang, China, recognized for its ecological and entomological significance. It serves as the **type locality** for the species *Parasarcophaga pleskei*, a parasitoid fly first described in this area, which is critical for taxonomic reference and scientific study. Additionally, the region is home to the species **1280钩阳折麻蝇** (a Chinese name for a fly species, likely *Parasarcophaga* sp. or a related genus), further highlighting its role as a biodiversity hotspot for dipteran insects. These findings underscore Central Tianshan’s importance in the study of fly taxonomy and distribution, particularly for species within the Sarcophagidae family. The area’s unique environmental conditions, including its mountainous terrain and temperate climate, may contribute to the presence of specialized insect populations. Both descriptions align in identifying Central Tianshan as a key location for entomological research in China, though the specific ecological or behavioral traits of the mentioned species are not detailed in the provided data. The region’s dual association with *Parasarcophaga pleskei* and 1280钩阳折麻蝇 emphasizes its value in understanding the diversity and geographic specificity of insect life in Xinjiang. No contradictions exist between the descriptions, as they reference distinct species within the same broader ecological context.\",2\n5350,PARASARCOPHAGA SIMILIS,,4\n59,原苏联,,5\n61,DR. E. P.
