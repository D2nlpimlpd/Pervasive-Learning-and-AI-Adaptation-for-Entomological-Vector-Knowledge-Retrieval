As part of the Yaeyama Islands group, Iriomote is the second-largest of the Ryukyu Islands and is renowned for its unique biodiversity and ecological importance. The island is particularly notable as a habitat for several species of scientific interest, including those within the genus *Dichaetomyia* and the specific species *Synorbitomyia linearis*. These organisms, which are part of the broader Diptera (fly) family, are distributed internationally, with Iriomote Island serving as a key site in their global range. The presence of *Dichaetomyia* species on the island highlights its role in supporting a diverse array of dipteran fauna, while *Synorbitomyia linearis* is specifically documented as occurring there, underscoring the island's ecological distinctiveness. Iriomote's subtropical climate, dense forests, and relatively undisturbed natural environment contribute to its status as a critical area for the conservation and study of such species. The island's isolation and unique ecosystems have fostered the evolution of endemic and rare species, making it a focal point for researchers examining biogeographical patterns and species adaptation. Despite its ecological value, Iriomote faces challenges such as habitat fragmentation and human activity, which necessitate ongoing conservation efforts to preserve its natural heritage. The descriptions provided collectively emphasize the island's dual role as both a regional and international biodiversity hotspot, particularly for the aforementioned species, while resolving any ambiguity by clarifying that the \"\"species\"\" in the first description refers to the broader group of organisms associated with the island, including but not limited to *Dichaetomyia* and *Synorbitomyia linearis*.

It is renowned as a biodiversity hotspot, particularly for its role in the distribution and endemism of various insect species. The island serves as a key habitat for **Musca conducens**, a fly species documented as part of its native range. Additionally, **Dichaetomyia** species, which are distributed internationally, are also found on Ishigaki Island, highlighting its ecological connectivity to broader regions. Another notable species, **Synorbitomyia linearis**, is recorded as being present on the island, further underscoring its importance in entomological studies.  \n\nThe island is specifically recognized as the **type locality** for **Phaonia ryukyuensis**, a species endemic to the Ryukyu Islands, indicating that it was first identified and described from this location. This distinction emphasizes Ishigaki's role in scientific taxonomy and conservation. Furthermore, **Bengalia** species, which are part of the Ryukyu archipelago's unique fauna, are distributed on the island, aligning with its status as a center for regional biodiversity. The general reference to \"\"fly species\"\" distributed on Ishigaki Island likely encompasses the aforementioned taxa, as the Ryukyu archipelago is known for its diverse and often endemic insect populations.  \n\nAs part of the Ryukyu Islands, Ishigaki's subtropical climate and isolated geography contribute to the presence of specialized species and the potential for international dispersal of others. The island's ecological significance is reinforced by its inclusion in multiple distribution records for both endemic and widely ranging taxa.
