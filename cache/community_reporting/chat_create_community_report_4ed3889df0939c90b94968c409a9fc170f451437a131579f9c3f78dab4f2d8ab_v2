Additionally, the pharyngeal bones of these larvae exhibit a dorsal angle longer than the ventral angle, further aiding in their identification.

This tribal distinction highlights the subfamily’s diversity in reproductive anatomy. Sarcophagininae species are typically found in decaying organic matter, such as carrion or dung, where their larvae develop. Adults are often metallic in coloration, a common trait among Sarcophagidae, and play roles in decomposition and nutrient cycling.  \n\nThe data provided contains a minor contradiction: one description refers to Sarcophagininae as a \"\"subfamily under Sarcophagidae,\"\" while another mistakenly labels it as a \"\"tribe within the Sarcophagidae subfamily.\"\" This is resolved by clarifying that Sarcophagininae is a subfamily, with tribes (e.g., the one linked to the second type of female abdominal morphology) nested within it.
