The province hosts multiple species within the **Muscina** genus, including *Muscina axata* (found in Qingdao and Xu Cheng) and *Muscina rufitibia* (recorded in Jinan and Qingdao). It is also home to *Musca autumnalis*, *Musca convexifrons* (notably in Qingdao and Jinan), *Musca conducens*, and *Musca sorbens*. Additionally, *Parasarcophaga* species such as *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni*, *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, and *Parasarcophaga polystylata* are documented in Shandong, alongside *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*.  \n\nThe genus **Adia** and **Winthemia** are reported to have distributions in Shandong, as are species like *Atherigona yiwulushan*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Carcelia matsukarehae*, *Carcelia kockiana*, *Graphomya rufitibia*, *Lispe monochaita*, *Lispe melaleuca*, *Phormia regina* (Jinan), *Stomorhina obsoleta*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Bellardia menechmoides* (Jinan), and *Bellardia nartshukae*. Specific locations within Shandong, such as **Mount Tai** (associated with *Muscina*), **Taishan** and **Heze** (linked to the \"\"Thick Ring Black Fly\"\"), and **Laoshan** and **Shida** (where *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) jacobsoni* was found), highlight localized biodiversity.  \n\nShandong is further noted for its role in the distribution of the genus **Hoa** and species like *Chaetexorista ateripalpis*, *Pierrettia tsintaoensis*, *Gonia chinensis*, *Gonia bimaculata*, *Exorista fasciata*, *Miltogramma iberium*, and *Haematobia*. The province also supports the domestic presence of *Fucellia apicalis* and *Fucellia chinensis*, as well as *Calythea cheni* and *Cuphocera varia*. Records of *Delia antiqua* and *Anthomyia procellaris* (and *Anthomyia illocata*) underscore its ecological importance for both common and specialized fly populations.  \n\nIn Chinese, the province is associated with the distribution of **紫翠蝇** (a species likely related to the genus *Parasarcophaga*) and **棕尾别麻蝇**, emphasizing its role in regional entomological studies. Shandong’s cities, including **Qingdao** and **Jinan**, are frequently cited as key habitats for these species, reflecting the province’s varied ecosystems. The data collectively illustrate Shandong as a critical area for the study of fly biodiversity in China, with a wide array of genera and species documented across its geographic and ecological landscapes.  \n\nThis summary consolidates all provided descriptions, resolving redundancies while maintaining the full context of Shandong’s entomological significance. The province’s role as a hub for multiple fly species, including those with specific localities, highlights its importance in both regional and national insect distribution patterns.\",47\n2077,QINGDAO,\"\n\nQingdao is a city located in Shandong province, China, as consistently noted across all provided descriptions.

Additionally, Qingdao is part of the geographic distribution range for *Calliphora axata*, a blowfly species commonly associated with forensic entomology and ecological studies. The city’s significance in biological contexts is further underscored by its role in the documentation of these two species, which are linked to its regional environment. While the descriptions primarily emphasize Qingdao’s administrative and geographic identity as a coastal city in Shandong, the specific references to *Pierrettia tsintaoensis* and *Calliphora axata* highlight its importance in scientific research and biodiversity records.
