It serves as a key publication platform for the classification, description, and documentation of insect species, particularly within China. The journal has a long history of publishing significant contributions to the field, including the 1983 paper on *Eutrichota*, which advanced understanding of this taxonomic group. In 1989, it featured the description of *Phaonia dismagnicornis* and *Drymeia grapsopoda* by Xue, highlighting its role in documenting new species and their morphological characteristics. \n\nNotable species described in the journal include *曲叶近脉花蝇*, *瘦叶近脉花蝇*, *瘦喙近脉花蝇*, *细柄折蜂麻蝇*, *Phaonia xianensis*, *Phaonia graciloides*, *横山阳蝇*, and *四点阳蝇*. These publications often provide detailed taxonomic analyses, emphasizing the journal’s commitment to systematic entomology. Additionally, it records domestic distribution data for species such as *Phaonia xianensis* and *Phaonia graciloides*, offering critical ecological and geographical insights. The journal also references other species, such as *横山阳蝇* and *四点阳蝇*, in its studies, underscoring its utility as a comprehensive resource for insect biodiversity in China. \n\nAs a peer-reviewed outlet, *昆虫分类学报* supports both foundational and applied research in entomology, contributing to the global scientific community’s understanding of insect taxonomy and related disciplines. Its multilingual approach (Chinese and English titles) ensures accessibility to both domestic and international audiences. The journal’s historical publications, including works from the 1980s, reflect its enduring role in advancing taxonomic knowledge and documenting regional insect fauna.
