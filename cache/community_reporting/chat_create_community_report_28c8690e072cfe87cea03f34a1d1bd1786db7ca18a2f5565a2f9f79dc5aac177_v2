The study, published in 1939, focused on the biology, behavior, or ecological role of *Lucilia cuprina cuprina*, a species of blowfly commonly found in arid regions and known for its role in decomposition and forensic entomology. While the descriptions provided do not specify the exact findings or methodologies of the research, they collectively confirm Knipling’s contribution to entomological literature during that period. The *Annual of the Entomological Society of America* is a peer-reviewed journal that publishes research on insect science, suggesting that Knipling’s work was part of a broader academic effort to study insect populations, their interactions with the environment, or their significance in agricultural or ecological contexts. The consistency between the two descriptions—both highlighting the 1939 publication and the entomological focus—indicates that Knipling’s study was a notable entry in the journal, though further details about the study’s scope, conclusions, or Knipling’s broader career remain unspecified in the provided data. This summary synthesizes the available information to establish Knipling as a contributor to entomology through a 1939 publication centered on *Lucilia cuprina cuprina*, aligning with the journal’s mission to advance understanding of insect-related phenomena.\",2\n6185,ANNUAL OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,Journal where Knipling's 1939 study on Lucilia cuprina cuprina was published.,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11964,HEBEI,PUBLICATION BY KNIPLING IN 1939,The 1939 publication references larvae activity in Hebei,101\n11962,KNIPLING,ANNUAL OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,Knipling authored a study on Lucilia cuprina cuprina in Annual of the Entomological Society of America,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
