It is partially characterized by the presence of 0–1 postdorsal bristles on the mid tibia and 2 postdorsal bristles on the hind tibia, distinguishing it from other related genera. Members of this genus typically exhibit black legs and black mandibular palps, which are notable morphological features. Additionally, male Egle flies possess a single bristle on the anterior margin of the fifth abdominal segment, a trait specific to their sex. The body length of Egle species ranges from 1.9 to 6.0 mm, indicating a moderate size variation within the genus. These combined characteristics—bristle patterns on the tibia, coloration of appendages, and male-specific abdominal bristles—serve as key diagnostic traits for identifying Egle within the broader context of fly taxonomy. The genus remains a subject of entomological study due to its unique morphological adaptations and ecological roles.\",2\n3673,LUCILIA (PHAEINICIA) CUPRINA DORSALIS,\"A subspecies of *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina* described by R.-D. in 1830. It has a bright metallic copper-green or bluish-green body and is associated with sheep myiasis. Its distribution includes Africa, India, and Oceania, but the author has not examined its specimens.\",5\n468,R.-D.,\"\n\nR.-D., likely referring to the 19th-century entomologist and taxonomist **Robineau-Desvoidy**, was a prominent figure in the classification of fly species and genera during the 1830s. Active in 1830, he contributed significantly to the taxonomy of Diptera (true flies), describing multiple genera and species. Among the genera attributed to him are **Delia**, **Adia**, **Hylemyia**, **Hydrophoria**, **Paraprosalpia**, **Leucophora**, **Egle**, **Paregla**, and **Pegomya**. His work on **Delia** and **Hylemyia** is explicitly noted, as is his role in establishing **Pegomya** in 1830. Additionally, he described the species **Agria punctata** (commonly referred to as *普野蝇* in Chinese), **Protophomia terraenovae**, and **Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina dorsalis**, the latter of which was later reclassified under the genus *Lucilia* (formerly *Phaenicia*).  \n\nRobineau-Desvoidy’s contributions span both species-level and genus-level classifications, reflecting his expertise in systematizing insect biodiversity. His 1830 descriptions of *Delia* and *Hylemyia* laid foundational work for understanding these groups, while his identification of *Leucophora* and *Pegomya* further expanded the taxonomic framework of flies. The species *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina dorsalis* is particularly notable as a subspecies or variant of *Lucilia cuprina*, a blow fly species, and its attribution to R.-D. underscores his role in early 19th-century entomological research.  \n\nDespite the brevity of the provided data, the recurring emphasis on 1830 highlights a concentrated period of activity for R.-D. in this field. The descriptions do not present direct contradictions but rather reinforce his association with a diverse array of fly taxa. His work remains referenced in modern entomology, particularly for species and genera that have undergone subsequent taxonomic revisions. For example, the genus *Phaenicia* is now synonymized with *Lucilia*, yet R.-D.’s original 1830 description of *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina dorsalis* is preserved in nomenclatural history. Similarly, the genus *Agria* (as in *Agria punctata*) and *Protophomia* are linked to his contributions, though their current classifications may differ.  \n\nIn summary, R.-D. (Robineau-Desvoidy) was a key taxonomist in the 1830s who described numerous fly genera and species, including *Delia*, *Hylemyia*, *Leucophora*, *Pegomya*, *Agria punctata*, *Protophomia terraenovae*, and *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina dorsalis*. His work exemplifies the systematic approach to entomology during the 19th century, providing critical baseline classifications that continue to inform contemporary studies of fly biodiversity. The initials \"\"R.-D.\"\" are likely a shorthand for his name, a common practice in scientific literature of the era. His legacy is preserved in the nomenclature of these taxa, even as some have been reclassified over time.  \n\n(Word count: 250)\",13\n487,LEUCOPHORA,\"\n\n**Leucophora** is a genus of flies belonging to the family Anthomyiidae, characterized by a combination of morphological and geographic traits. Morphologically, species within this genus exhibit a narrow frons (the area between the eyes on the head) and lack distinct dark thoracic spots, distinguishing them from other anthomyiid genera. Additionally, they are notable for their leg coloration, which is either entirely black or partially yellow, and a specific feature in males: a single bristle located on the anterior margin of the fifth abdominal segment. The body size of Leucophora flies typically ranges from 5.0 to 9.5 mm, as indicated by reference measurements. \n\nGeographically, the genus has a broad distribution spanning two major biogeographic regions: the Palaearctic, which includes Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and the Neotropical region, encompassing Central and South America. This wide range suggests adaptability to diverse climates and ecosystems. While the first description emphasizes the absence of thoracic markings and the narrow frons, the second highlights leg coloration and male-specific bristle features, both of which are consistent and complementary, providing a more complete taxonomic profile. \n\nLeucophora’s classification within the Anthomyiidae family aligns it with other true flies, many of which are associated with plant or fungal habitats. The combination of its physical traits—narrow frons, unmarked thorax, leg coloration, and the male abdominal bristle—serves as key identifiers for entomologists. The genus’s presence in both temperate and tropical zones underscores its ecological versatility. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as they collectively define the genus’s morphology, size, and distribution. Together, these details establish Leucophora as a distinct and widely distributed group within the Anthomyiidae family, with specific diagnostic features that aid in its recognition and study.\",4\n497,HYLEMIA,\"\n\n**HYLEMIA** is a genus of flies (Diptera) first described by the French entomologist Robineau-Desvoidy in 1830. It is taxonomically defined in the narrow sense by two key morphological characteristics: the presence of two anterior ventral bristles (鬃) on the hind tibia and the inclusion of prealar bristles. These features distinguish *Hylemia* from other related genera within the fly family. The genus is part of the broader classification of flies, which encompasses a wide diversity of species with varied ecological roles and morphological traits. Robineau-Desvoidy’s original description established the foundational taxonomy for *Hylemia*, and subsequent studies have likely expanded on its classification, though the core diagnostic traits remain consistent with the 1830 definition. As a taxonomic group, *Hylemia* contributes to the understanding of dipteran biodiversity and evolutionary adaptations, particularly in the context of bristle patterns used for identification and phylogenetic analysis. The mention of \"\"narrow sense\"\" in the first description suggests that the genus may have undergone revisions or subtaxonomic refinements over time, but the defining bristle features on the hind tibia and prealar region remain central to its identification. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the same taxonomist, year of description, and primary morphological traits.\",4\n483,HYDROPHORIA,\"\n\n**Hydrophoria** is a genus of flies characterized by distinct morphological features. The genus was first described by R.-D. in 1830 and is notable for its black legs, a trait consistently observed across its species. Males of the genus exhibit specific anatomical structures, including a preapical bristle on the anterior surstylus, which is a key identifier for classification. Additionally, male Hydrophoria flies often possess long, sclerotized lateral tail lobes, further distinguishing them within the fly family. In terms of body size, individuals in this genus typically range from 4.0 to 11.0 mm in length, as noted in comparative studies. Another defining characteristic is the absence of a terminal posterior abdominal bristle on the hind tibia, a feature that differentiates Hydrophoria from related genera. These traits collectively contribute to the taxonomic identification of the genus, emphasizing its unique adaptations and structural variations. The descriptions provided align in defining Hydrophoria as a group of flies with specialized male morphology and specific leg and tail features, with no contradictory information to resolve. The genus remains a subject of entomological study due to its distinct physical attributes and ecological niche.\",3\n490,DELIA,\"\n\n**DELIA** is a genus of flies first described by R.-D. in 1830. It is characterized by a combination of distinct morphological traits that distinguish it from other related genera. Members of this genus typically exhibit black bodies, a feature highlighted in the second description. Morphologically, they lack premedian side bristles, a key identifier from the first description, and possess a single anterior ventral bristle on the hind tibia. Additionally, the second description specifies that Delia species have two or more posterior dorsal bristles on the hind tibia, further refining their anatomical profile. Males of the genus are uniquely marked by a single bristle on the anterior margin of the fifth abdominal segment, a detail not included in the first description. The body length of Delia flies is generally within the range of 4.0 to 7.0 mm, as noted in the second description. These combined features—absence of premedian side bristles, presence of a single anterior ventral bristle on the hind tibia, multiple posterior dorsal bristles on the same leg, black body coloration, and male-specific abdominal bristles—provide a comprehensive framework for identifying and classifying species within the genus. The descriptions are consistent in their focus on tibial bristle patterns and body color, with the second adding specific measurements and male genitalia details. No direct contradictions exist between the two accounts, as they address different aspects of the genus’s morphology. DELIA’s defining characteristics thus encompass both structural and color-based traits, supported by historical taxonomic work and modern observational data.\",2\n467,隰蝇,Leucophora is a genus of flies described by R.-D. in 1830,1\n495,ADIA,\"A genus of flies described by R.-D. in 1830, characterized by the absence of premedian side鬃 and 1 postdorsal鬃 on the hind tibia\",1\n4536,普野蝇AGRIA PUNCTATA R.-D.,A species of fly (Agria punctata R.-D.) mentioned in the text as part of a classification key.,1\n6216,PROTOPHOMIA TERRAENOVAE,,2\n476,HYDROPHORIA R.-D.,Hydrophoria R.-D. is a person who described the genus Hydrophoria in 1830,1\n502,LEPTOHYLEMYIA,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n405,EGLE,ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY,Robineau-Desvoidy described the genus Egle in 1830,114\n6751,LUCILIA (PHAEINICIA) CUPRINA DORSALIS,R.-D.,R.-D. described *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina dorsalis* in 1830,18\n394,R.-D.,LEUCOPHORA,R.-D. is the taxonomist who described the genus Leucophora,17\n408,HYLEMIA,R.-D.,\"\n\nThe genus **Hylemya** was first described by **R.-D.** in 1830.
