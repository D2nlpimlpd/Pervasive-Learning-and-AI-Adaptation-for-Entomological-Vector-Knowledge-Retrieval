Its vast territory, encompassing Siberia, the Far East, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the European part, provided diverse habitats for a wide array of taxa. Key species documented in the Soviet Union include *Macronychia striginervis* and *Macronychia polyodon*, as well as *Pseudocoenosia fletcheri*, which was noted in Siberia and the Ural Mountains. The genus *Robineauella* (e.g., *Robineauella pseudoscoparia* and *Robineauella scoparia*) was distributed across its European regions, Turkestan, Siberia, the Far East, the Ussuri border, and Sakhalin Island. *Phaonia* species such as *Phaonia fuscata*, *Phaonia hybrida*, *Phaonia malaisei*, *Phaonia nigripennis*, *Phaonia luteovittata*, and *Phaonia asierrans* were found in the Far East, Western Siberia, Tajikistan, and northern/central European regions.  \n\nThe Soviet Union also hosted multiple *Helina* species, including *Helina confinis*, *Helina cothurnata*, *Helina latitarsis*, *Helina parcepilosa*, *Helina obscuratoides*, *Helina lasiophthalma*, and *Helina punctifemoralis*, across the Far East, Eastern Siberia, Central Asia, and northern Europe. Other notable genera and species included *Parasarcophaga* (e.g., *Parasarcophaga pleskei*, *Parasarcophaga portschinskyi*, *Parasarcophaga emdeni*), *Phormia regina* (European part, Siberia, Transbaikal), *Strobilomyia* (Siberia, Baikal Lake), *Oestrus* (Central Asia, southern Europe), *Oestromyia* (Far East, Central Asia, Siberia, Transcaucasia), and *Pollenomyia sinensis* (Primorsky Krai). Specific species like *Tachina albidopilosa*, *Tachina nupta*, *Servillia ardens*, *Scathophaga suilla*, *Scathophaga mellipes*, *Musca larvipara*, *Musca sorbens*, and *Hydrotaea palaestrica* were recorded in its regions, with some extending internationally.  \n\nThe country was also linked to the distribution of *Fannia kowarzi*, *Fannia prisca*, *Fannia canicularis*, *Lispe frigida* (Siberia), *Lispe odessae* (Odessa), *Lispe leucospila*, *Blaesoxipha unicolor*, *Blaesoxipha arenicola*, *Blaesoxipha litoralis*, and *Gymnadichosia pusilla*. Chinese-named species such as 1279膨端折麻蝇, 1280钩阳折麻蝇, 1281毛股折麻蝇, 1396犁头亚麻蝇, 1398拟对岛亚麻蝇, and 肖瘤胫厕蝇 were documented in areas like Kazakhstan and the Far East. Additionally, the Soviet Union served as the type locality for *Phormiata phormiata* in Tajikistan and was associated with research on *Holotrichia diomphalia* by K.Б. Борнцова-Эннобт,ena.  \n\nThe region’s ecological diversity supported species like the Caesar Greenbottle Fly (*Chrysomya* sp.), the black-spotted greenbottle fly, and the Brush Spring Fly (Kamchatka, Siberia). Genera such as *Adia*, *Sinonipponia*, *Prosena*, *Egle muscaria*, *Drymeia vicana*, and *Brontaea* were also part of its fauna. Notably, the Soviet Union contributed to taxonomic studies of Sarcophagini, with records of *Sarcophaga semenovi*, *Sarcophaga misera*, *Sarcophaga sericea*, and *Sarcophaga aegyptica*.  \n\nIn summary, the Soviet Union, as a former country, was a critical hub for the distribution of numerous fly species and genera, spanning its European, Central Asian, and Siberian territories. Its role in entomological research and the presence of both native and internationally documented species highlight its ecological and scientific significance. The consolidation of these records reflects the country’s historical importance in biodiversity studies, despite its dissolution in 1991.
