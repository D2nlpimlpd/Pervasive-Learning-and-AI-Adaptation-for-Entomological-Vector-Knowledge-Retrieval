Spanning diverse geographical areas such as Siberia, the Ural Mountains, the Far East, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the European part of the country, the Soviet Union hosted a wide array of taxa. Among the species documented in its territories were **Macronychia striginervis** and **Macronychia polyodon**, as well as **Pseudocoenosia fletcheri**, which extended internationally to regions like Siberia and the Ural Mountains. The **Robineauella (D.) pseudoscoparia** and **Robineauella scoparia** were also recorded, with the latter covering the Soviet Union’s European part, Turkestan, Siberia, the Far East, the Ussuri border, and Sakhalin Island.  \n\nMultiple **Helina** species, including *Helina confinis* (Far East), *Helina cothurnata*, *Helina latitarsis*, *Helina parcepilosa*, *Helina obscuratoides*, *Helina lasiophthalma*, and *Helina punctifemoralis*, were distributed across the Soviet Union’s European, Siberian, and Central Asian regions. The country was also home to **Parasarcophaga** species such as *Parasarcophaga pleskei*, *Parasarcophaga portschinskyi*, and *Parasarcophaga emdeni*, alongside **Phaonia** species like *Phaonia fuscata* (Far East, Western Siberia, Tajikistan, and northern/central Europe), *Phaonia hybrida*, *Phaonia malaisei*, *Phaonia asierrans*, *Phaonia luteovittata*, and *Phaonia nigripennis*. **Strobilomyia** species, including *Strobilomyia laricicola* (Siberia), and **Oestrus** and **Oestromyia** genera (Central Asia, southern Europe, and the Far East) were also noted.  \n\nThe Soviet Union’s regions, such as Krasnovodsk, Chiva, and the Far East’s Primorsky Krai, supported species like **Senotainia deserta**, **Apodacra**, **Miltogrammoides**, **Gymnadichosia pusilla**, **Pollenomyia sinensis**, and **Pollenomyia okazakii**. **Tachina albidopilosa** and **Tachina nupta** were found internationally within the country, while **Servillia ardens** and **Scathophaga suilla** (including *mellipes*) were documented in the Far East and Eastern Siberia. **Protophormia terraenovae** and **Phormia regina** were present in European, Siberian, and Transbaikal regions, and **Phaonia pallidisquama**, **Phaonia consobrina**, and **Phaonia villana** were part of its international distribution records.  \n\nChinese-named species such as **1279膨端折麻蝇**, **1280钩阳折麻蝇**, **1281毛股折麻蝇**, **1396犁头亚麻蝇**, **1398拟对岛亚麻蝇**, and **古北蝗蝇** (Kazakhstan) were also reported. The country’s biodiversity included **Musca larvipara**, **Musca sorbens**, and **Musca crassirostris**, with the former’s life cycle studied in the region. **Lispe** species like *Lispe frigida* (Siberia), *Lispe odessae* (Odessa), and *Lispe leucospila* were documented, as were **Fannia prisca**, **Fannia canicularis**, and **Fannia kowarzi**.  \n\nThe Soviet Union played a role in the taxonomy and research of species such as **Sarcorohdendorfia antilope**, **Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi** (type locality in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan), and **Protocalliphora lii**, with contributions from scientists like *K.Б.
