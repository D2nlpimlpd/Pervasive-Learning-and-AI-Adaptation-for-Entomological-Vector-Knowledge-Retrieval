The holotype, a critical reference specimen used for the original taxonomic description of the species, was obtained by Wang Weiming in this specific location, underscoring their contribution to the documentation of biodiversity in the region. The second description corroborates this, specifying that the specimen collected was of *Mydaea (sensu stricto) bideserta*, a taxonomic clarification indicating the species is considered in its strictest sense. Both accounts align on the date, location, and entity involved, with no contradictions to resolve. Wang Weiming’s work in Shennongjia highlights their role in entomological or biological research, particularly in the study of this species, which may belong to the family of flies (Diptera) or a related group, given the genus *Mydaea* is typically classified within the order Diptera. The consistency in the data allows for a unified summary emphasizing Wang Weiming’s collection of the holotype specimen of *Mydaea bideserta* in Hubei’s Shennongjia on August 8, 1982, with the taxonomic note \"\"sensu stricto\"\" clarifying the species’ classification. This event is significant for scientific records, as holotypes serve as the primary basis for species identification and classification. No additional details about Wang Weiming’s broader research, career, or other specimens collected are provided in the descriptions, so the summary remains focused on the specific contribution to *Mydaea bideserta* taxonomy.
