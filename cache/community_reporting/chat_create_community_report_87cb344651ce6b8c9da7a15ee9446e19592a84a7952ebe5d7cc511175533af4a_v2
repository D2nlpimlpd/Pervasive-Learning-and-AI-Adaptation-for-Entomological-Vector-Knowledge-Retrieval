It served as the platform where the species *Bellardia menechma* was first described in 1934 by the entomologist Seguy. Additionally, the same journal documented the description of *Pollenomyia sinensis* by Seguy in 1935, further establishing its role in advancing the understanding of dipteran taxonomy. These entries highlight the journal’s historical significance in entomological research, particularly through the work of Seguy, who utilized it to publish detailed accounts of newly identified species. The *ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ENTOMOLOGY* thus functions as a critical reference for entomologists, preserving key taxonomic records from the early 20th century. Its dual role as both a journal and an encyclopedic resource underscores its value in compiling and disseminating specialized knowledge about insect biodiversity. The descriptions of *Bellardia menechma* and *Pollenomyia sinensis* within its pages reflect the journal’s commitment to documenting discoveries across different years and species, contributing to the broader scientific discourse on entomology. By consolidating these accounts, the publication remains a foundational text for researchers studying the taxonomy and ecology of insects.\",4\n2883,LIANYING,\"\n\n**Liaoning** is a province located in the northeastern region of China, known for its diverse ecological habitats and the presence of multiple species.
