It serves as a key habitat for multiple genera and species, including **Atherigona reversura**, **Atherigona oryzae**, and **Atherigona triglomerata**, which are documented in the area. The region is also associated with **Musca malaisei** and **Musca seniorwhitei**, as well as the Chinese species **611扁蹠芒蝇** (likely *Atherigona sp.*) and **612黄髭芒蝇** (*Atherigona sp.*). Additionally, Xishuangbanna is the type locality for three *Isomyia* species: **Isomyia sagittalis**, **Isomyia quadrina**, and **Isomyia verirecta**, and it hosts **Isomyia isomyia** and **Isomyia viridaurea** as part of their broader distribution.  \n\nThe area is notable for the presence of **Achoetandrus rufifacies**, a species linked to its ecological context in Yunnan. Xishuangbanna is also a distribution site for **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly** (*Pierretia caudagalli*), **1340杯细麻蝇** (*Musca sp.*), and **Ceylonomyia nigripes**. It is explicitly mentioned as the domestic and foreign distribution site for **云南亚麻蝇** (Yunnan Atherigona fly), with the Chinese name **中国云南西双版纳** (Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China) cited as its type locality. The region further supports **Sarcorohdendorfia inextricata** and **Hypopygiopsis infumata**, the latter of which is specifically noted to include the sub-region **Daminglong** within Xishuangbanna.  \n\nXishuangbanna’s ecological importance is underscored by its role as a habitat for these diverse species, many of which are endemic or have limited geographic ranges. The descriptions consistently identify it as part of Yunnan Province, with some specifying it as a \"\"sublocation\"\" in broader distribution contexts. While terms like \"\"location,\"\" \"\"region,\"\" and \"\"city\"\" are used interchangeably in the data, Xishuangbanna is officially a prefecture-level city in Yunnan, encompassing both urban and rural areas. Its tropical and subtropical climate, along with rich ecosystems, likely contribute to the presence of such a wide array of fly species, including those with scientific names in both Latin and Chinese. The region’s status as a type locality for several species highlights its significance in entomological research.  \n\nIn summary, XISHUANGBANNA is a biodiverse hub in Yunnan, China, where multiple fly species—spanning genera like *Atherigona*, *Musca*, *Isomyia*, and others—are documented, with some having their type localities or primary distributions there. Key species include *Atherigona reversura*, *Musca malaisei*, *Isomyia sagittalis*, *Achoetandrus rufifacies*, and *Hypopygiopsis infumata*, among others, with sub-regions like Daminglong playing a role in specific distributions. The area’s ecological and taxonomic relevance is further emphasized by its association with both domestic and international scientific records.

Specifically, it serves as the type locality for *612黄髭芒蝇* (a species of fly, likely *Atherigona* sp. based on the context), and it is also the designated type locality for *Atherigona triglomerata*, a species within the same genus. These designations highlight Coimbatore's role in the taxonomic classification of flies, particularly those in the *Atherigona* genus, which are often studied for their ecological and agricultural relevance. The city’s geographical and environmental characteristics, typical of southern India, may contribute to the presence and diversity of such species in the area. While the descriptions provided focus on entomological data, they collectively underscore Coimbatore’s importance as a reference point for scientific research related to these specific fly species. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as both align in identifying the city as a type locality for distinct but related species.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n10120,云南亚麻蝇,FAN,FAN于1964年首次描述了云南亚麻蝇,301\n4393,612黄髭芒蝇ATHERIGONA PULLA,YUNNAN,612黄髭芒蝇 is distributed in Yunnan,165\n9617,ROHDENDORF,1354 TAIL PIERRETIAS,Rohdendorf referenced the 1354 Tail Pierretia Fly in 1937,103\n6794,XISHUANGBANNA,HEMIPYRELLIA,\"Hemipyrellia is distributed in Xishuangbanna, China\",34\n9623,ENTOMOLOGISCHE MITTEILUNGEN,1354 TAIL PIERRETIAS,The species was referenced in the Entomologische Mitteilungen journal,10\n4396,612黄髭芒蝇ATHERIGONA PULLA,COIMBATORE,\"612黄髭芒蝇 is distributed in Coimbatore, India\",7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
