It serves as a source for entomological research, with contributions detailing the morphology, distribution, and classification of various taxa. The series has published descriptions of multiple species across different genera, including *Helina leptinocorpus* and *Helina subhirsutibia* (likely within the family Muscidae or related), *Calythea xizangensis* (a species associated with the Xizang region, or Tibet), and *Leucophora shanxiensis* (noted for its distribution in Shanxi Province). Additionally, it has documented species of the genus *Pegohylemyia* and *Metalliopsis*, including *Metalliopsis producta* and *Metalliopsis ciliilunula*. These publications collectively highlight the series’ role in advancing understanding of China’s insect fauna, with a particular emphasis on regional biodiversity and the discovery of new or understudied species. The series appears to prioritize detailed taxonomic work, often providing insights into ecological contexts, geographic ranges, and morphological characteristics. While the specific focus on genera and species varies across entries, the overarching theme is the systematic study and dissemination of entomological data from China, contributing to both national and global scientific knowledge. The inclusion of species from diverse regions such as Tibet and Shanxi underscores its geographic breadth, and the repeated mention of multiple genera suggests a multidisciplinary approach to insect research. The INSECT RESEARCH SERIES is thus a critical resource for entomologists, offering peer-reviewed documentation of China’s rich and varied insect life.\",12\n1210,PEGOHYLEMIA LATIRUFIFRONS,Fly species described by Fan in 1984,3\n1062,SEUY,Author of Leucophora amicula,2\n3174,WU ET AL.,Wu et al. are the authors of the species Helina subhirsutibia,2\n1214,QILIAN GOURD CAVE,Qinghai location as the type locality for Pegohylemyia latirufifrons,1\n3178,MAQUET,Maquet is the type locality for Helina subhirsutibia in Gansu,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1702,INSECT RESEARCH SERIES,PEGOHYLEMIA LATIRUFIFRONS,Published in Insect Research Series,15\n1398,SEUY,INSECT RESEARCH SERIES,Seuy's species is referenced in the Insect Research Series,14\n5710,WU ET AL.,INSECT RESEARCH SERIES,Wu et al. published Helina subhirsutibia in the Insect Research Series,14\n1715,PEGOHYLEMIA LATIRUFIFRONS,QILIAN GOURD CAVE,Type locality at Qilian Gourd Cave,4\n5711,WU ET AL.,MAQUET,Wu et al.'s species Helina subhirsutibia has a type locality in Maquet,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
