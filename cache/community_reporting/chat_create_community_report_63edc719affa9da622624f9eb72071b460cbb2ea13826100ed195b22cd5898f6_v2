Key works include the description of *Phaonia mimovivida* and *Phaonia nigrigenis* as sole author, as well as co-describing the subspecies *Mydaea setifemur kongdinga* with Xue. FENG also co-authored the description of *Phaonia cothurnoloba* with Xue and contributed to the characterization of *Phaonia pilipes*, *Phaonia suberrans*, and *Phaonia fissa* in collaborative efforts. Notably, FENG described *Phorbia gemmullata* in 1982 and is credited as the sole author of this species. Additionally, they co-authored the description of *Brontaea sichuanensis* and the new species *Megophyra subpenicillata*. FENG’s work extends to the *Paradichosia* genus, where they co-described *Paradichosia blaesostyla*, *Paradichosia brachyphalla*, and *Paradichosia kangdingensis*. Their research has been published in journals such as *Acta Zoologica Sinica*, where they collaborated on the description of *Phaonia cothurnoloba* and other *Phaonia* species. FENG’s partnership with MA is highlighted in the co-description of *Phaonia mimoincana*.
