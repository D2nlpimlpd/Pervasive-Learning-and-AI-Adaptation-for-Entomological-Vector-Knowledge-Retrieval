Notably, Zhang co-described the species *Polleniopsis yunnanensis* in 1988 alongside Chen and Li, as documented in multiple entries. In the same year, Zhang also collaborated with Chao to describe *Senotainia sinerea* (later classified as *Senotainia (Sphixapata) sinerea*), and co-authored the description of *Eumetopiella (Arabiopsis) mesomelaenae* and *Eumetopiella (Intermedia) luridimacula*. Additionally, Zhang described *Phorbia securis xibeina* in 1988 and co-authored the 1988 descriptions of *Metopia pollenia* and *Metopia auripulvera*. These works were published in journals such as *Acta Zoologica Sinica* and the *Zoological Journal*.  \n\nZhang’s contributions extend to other species and subspecies. In 1978, Zhang co-described the subspecies *Leucomyia cinerea dukoica*. By 1982, Zhang had participated in the description of *Lasiomma divergens*. In 1988, Zhang was also involved in the co-description of *Miltogramma bimaculatum* and *Miltogramma tibitum*, as well as *Agria xiangchengensis* and *Sarcophila mongolica*. A separate entry clarifies that Zhang described *Phaonia wenshuiensis* in *Acta Zoologica Sinica*, though the specific year is not mentioned. Furthermore, Zhang co-authored the 1988 description of *Brachicoma nigra*.  \n\nBeyond formal taxonomic descriptions, Zhang is credited with collecting the specimen for *Hydrotaea nudispinosa* in the regions of Hainan and Qinghai. This fieldwork complements Zhang’s role in documenting biodiversity through collaborative research. Zhang’s work demonstrates a focus on Diptera (flies) and their classification, often in partnership with colleagues such as Chen, Li, Chao, and others. The repeated emphasis on 1988 highlights a productive period for Zhang in taxonomic research, during which multiple species and subspecies were formally described. While some entries reference different years (1978 and 1982), these are consistent with the timeline of Zhang’s career. Overall, Zhang’s contributions span both collaborative and independent efforts, underscoring a dedication to advancing entomological taxonomy.  \n\n(ZHANG’s work includes 19 species/subspecies across 1978, 1982, and 1988, with key collaborations and publications. The summary resolves minor redundancies by consolidating overlapping descriptions and clarifying the 1988 as a central year for multiple co-authored works.

It has been cited for its contributions to zoological research, including the formal description of *Metopia yunnanica*, a species detailed within its pages. Additionally, the journal features the description of *Protomiltogramma yunnanicum*, which was published in issue 6, page 279, and accompanied by figure 8 (notably referencing *Thereomyia* in the context of its classification or illustration). Another species, *Chaetogena gynacphorae*, was documented in volume 5, page 203, further highlighting the journal’s role in advancing knowledge of invertebrate or parasitic organisms. These entries collectively demonstrate the *ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL*’s utility as a repository for taxonomic work, particularly in entomology or related fields, with specific examples of species described in distinct issues and volumes. The journal’s structure, as evidenced by the cited references, includes detailed taxonomic accounts, supporting illustrations (e.g., figure 8 for *Protomiltogramma yunnanicum*), and precise pagination to facilitate scholarly access. While the descriptions of the three species are presented in separate issues and volumes, they align with the journal’s purpose of disseminating taxonomic research, ensuring consistency in its academic focus. The *ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL* thus appears to be a specialized, peer-reviewed outlet for zoological discoveries, emphasizing regional or niche species such as those associated with Yunnan (e.g., *Metopia yunnanica*, *Protomiltogramma yunnanicum*) and their morphological or ecological characteristics. Its inclusion of both textual and visual data (e.g., figure 8) underscores its commitment to comprehensive scientific communication. The journal’s historical records, spanning at least volume 5 and issue 6, suggest a long-standing tradition of contributing to taxonomic databases, though the exact timeline or scope of its publication history remains unspecified in the provided data.
