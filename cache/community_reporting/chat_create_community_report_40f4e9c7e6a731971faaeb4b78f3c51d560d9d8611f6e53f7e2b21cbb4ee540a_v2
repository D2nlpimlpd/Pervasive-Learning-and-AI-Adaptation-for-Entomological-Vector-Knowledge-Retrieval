Additionally, *Servaisia rossica*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, and *Strobilomyia* (notably in Austria) are found there, though the mention of North America for *Strobilomyia* may reflect broader international ranges.  \n\nEUROPE hosts multiple species from genera such as *Chirosia* (*C. similata*, *C. betuleti*, *C. albitarsis*, *C. frontata*), *Phaonia* (*Ph. disjuncta*, *Ph. pallidisquama*, *Ph. incana*, *Ph. fuscata* in Sweden), *Pegoplata* (*P. palposa*, *P. virginea*), and *Lispe* (*L. loewi*, *L. litorea*, *L. frigida*, *L. caesia*). The continent is also a foreign distribution region for species like *Nupedia aestiva*, *Nupedia fulva*, *Nupedia patellans*, *Enneastigma*, *Cuphocera varia*, *Carcelia matsukarehae*, *Carcelia ambigua*, *Dexiopsis lacteipennis* (type locality in Sweden), *Blondelia nigripes*, *Morellia simplex*, *Myxexoristops blondeli*, and *Robineauella pseudoscoparia* (type locality in France). Notably, *Hydrotaea cinerea* and *Ophyra spinigera* are found internationally in Europe, with the latter’s type locality in France.  \n\nThe region includes countries like Sweden, Austria, Germany, and Hungary, which are associated with specific species or type localities. For example, *Chirosia similata* and *Chirosia betuleti* are linked to Europe, while *Lydella grisescens* and *Phryxe vulgaris* are explicitly mentioned. Genera such as *Leucophora* (*L. unilineata*, *L. personata*, *L. dorsalis*), *Miltogramma* (*M. bimaculatum*, *M. brevipilum*, *M. iberium*), *Pegohylemyia* (*P. depressa* from Lapland, *P. betarum*, *P. pseudomaculipes*, *P. sanctimarci*, *P. striolata*), and *Lasiomma* (*L. anthomyinum*, *L. octoguttatum*) are also present.  \n\nEUROPE is highlighted as a distribution area for parasitic flies like *Parasarcophaga emdeni* and *Protocalliphora azurea*, as well as for species such as *Haematobia irritans*, *Xylotachina diluta*, *Blaesoxipha litoralis*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, *Drymeia vicana*, *Hylemya partita*, *Hylemya probilis*, *Muscina* (type locality possibly in Germany), and the black-spotted greenbottle fly (*Caesar Greenbottle Fly*). Chinese-named species like *斑足莠蝇*, *泛色莠蝇*, *亚山花蝇*, *多斑聚蜂麻蝇*, *华丽聚蜂麻蝇*, *类项圈厕蝇*, and *胸刺厕蝇* are also documented in Europe, alongside *巢缘花蝇* in Vienna and *1431家蚕追寄蝇*.  \n\nType localities within Europe include Lapland for *Chionomyia vetula* and *Pegohylemyia depressa*, Sweden for *Pegohylemyia latifrons*, and France for *Ophyra spinigera*. The continent is further noted as a region where multiple genera (*Buquetia*, *Xylotachina*, *Elodia*, *Timavia*, *Vibrissina Rondani*, *Zaira*) and subfamilies (e.g., *Muscidae*) are found, with some species like *Paraprosalpia pilitarsis* and *Exorista* species (*E. fasciata*, *E. larvarum*) having international ranges. Despite occasional references to \"\"foreign\"\" or unspecified localities, the data consistently emphasizes Europe as a central hub for these fly species, underscoring its ecological and taxonomic significance.  \n\n(Word count: 299)\",146\n5820,XYLOTACHINA DILUTA,\"\n\n**Xylotachina diluta** is a species of tachinid fly within the genus *Xylotachina*, first described by Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1824. This fly is characterized by a body length of approximately 9 mm, with a grayish coloration and distinct black abdominal bands. Its wing venation patterns are notable for their specific morphology, which aids in taxonomic identification. The species is distributed across Europe and has also been recorded in Ningxia, China, indicating a broader geographic range than initially implied by some sources.  \n\nIn terms of host associations, **Xylotachina diluta** exhibits regional variation. In Europe, it is primarily linked to *Cossus cossus* (Linnaeus, 1758), a large silk moth commonly known as the emperor moth, which is a wood borer. However, an earlier description also notes *Papilio machaon* (Linnaeus, 1758), the swallowtail butterfly, as a host in the same region. This discrepancy may reflect differences in host preference across populations or a historical misattribution. In China, the fly is associated with an unnamed wood borer species, suggesting potential adaptation to local hosts or underscoring the need for further taxonomic study in that region.  \n\nThe species’ dual host associations in Europe highlight its ecological flexibility, though the exact mechanisms of parasitism (e.g., larval development stages, host specificity) remain unclear from the provided data. Its presence in both Europe and China implies a possible role in regulating populations of wood-boring insects, though the ecological impact in China is less documented. Morphologically, the grayish body with black abdominal bands and unique wing venation are consistent features, aligning with broader tachinid fly traits such as parasitoid behavior and predatory larvae.  \n\nIn summary, **Xylotachina diluta** is a tachinid fly with a 9 mm body, grayish coloration, and black abdominal markings, found in Europe and China. It parasitizes *Cossus cossus* in Europe and an unnamed wood borer in China, with conflicting reports of *Papilio machaon* as a European host. These variations underscore the need for further research to clarify its host range and ecological interactions across its distribution. The species’ historical description by Meigen in 1824 and its morphological distinctiveness contribute to its significance in entomological studies.\",5\n625,ROQUES ET AL.,Researchers who documented the host plant interactions of Strobilomyia species in Europe in 1983,1\n4775,COPENHAGEN,\"\n\nCOPENHAGEN is a city located in Europe, specifically in the country of Denmark.

While the descriptions do not specify the exact taxonomic key or further details about *Ravinia striata*, they collectively underscore COPENHAGEN's significance as a location tied to formal taxonomic work.
