A type locality refers to the specific site where a species is first discovered, collected, and formally described in scientific literature, serving as a critical reference for taxonomic classification. In this case, Khao Yai holds significance as the origin point for the identification and naming of *Musca asiatica*, a species distinct from the more widely known common housefly (*Musca domestica*). The designation of Khao Yai as the type locality underscores its role in entomological research, particularly in the study of fly species native to Southeast Asia. While the descriptions provided are identical in content, they collectively emphasize the importance of this location in establishing the taxonomic identity of the Asian housefly. No contradictory information exists in the given data, and the summary consolidates the key detail that Khao Yai is the type locality for *Musca asiatica* in Thailand. This information is vital for scientists and researchers to accurately reference and study the species within its original ecological context.\",2\n3838,DAFULING,Location in Guangdong (Shenyi) where Tainanina yangchunensis is found as the type locality,1\n2106,SAYDAPET:GUINDY,Saydapet:Guindy is the type locality in India for the Asian housefly (Musca asiatica),1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n9265,SARCOROHDENDORFIA MIMOBASALIS,MA,Ma described *Sarcorohdendorfia mimobasalis* in 1964,87\n3585,PHILIPPINES,PALAWAN,Palawan is an island in the Philippines,37\n5574,ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA,PUBLICATION IN ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA,The journal where this publication event occurred,24\n7857,SARAWAK,CHLORORHINIA EXEMPTA,Sarawak is a location in Malaysia where Chlororhinia exempta is found,20\n4903,BRUNETTI,ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA,Brunetti's work is referenced in the journal Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica,19\n7169,FAN ET YAO,ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA,Fan et Yao described Tainanina yangchunensis in Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica,17\n4907,ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA,MU ET CHEN,Mu and Chen's work is referenced in the journal Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica,16\n3091,GUAM,WIEMANN,Wiedemann described a species found in Guam,15\n5262,PECTINISETA PECTINATA,CARICEA PROMINENS,Caricea prominens is synonymized with Pectiniseta pectinata,14\n5271,PECTINISETA PECTINATA,SOCOTRA ISLAND,Pectiniseta pectinata is distributed in Socotra Island,13\n5272,PECTINISETA PECTINATA,EAST AFRICA,Pectiniseta pectinata is distributed in East Africa,13\n5590,PINGLU SUNJIASI,PUBLICATION IN ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA,Species described in this event are found in Pinglu Sunjiasi,11\n5591,NANSANZHAI,PUBLICATION IN ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA,Species described in this event are found in Nanshanzhai,11\n5593,LONGDE,PUBLICATION IN ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA,Species described in this event are found in Longde,11\n4116,HAEMATOBIOSA,MALAYA,Haematobiosa austeni is distributed in Malaya,10\n3586,ASIAN HOUSEFLY,SHINONAGA ET KANO,Shinonaga et Kano described the Asian housefly in 1977,9\n2395,海南粪泉蝇,BRUNETTI,Brunetti described the species 海南粪泉蝇 in 1924,8\n3582,BORNEO,SABAH,Sabah is a city in Borneo,8\n2392,EMMESOMYIA KEMPI,BRUNETTI,Brunetti described this species in 1924,7\n4345,LYPEROSIA FLAVOHIRTA,BRUNETTI,Brunetti described the species Lyperosia flavohirta in 1910,6\n5259,PECTINISETA,CARICEA PROMINENS,Caricea prominens is the type species for the genus Pectiniseta,5\n2397,海南粪泉蝇,WANNING XINGLONG,\"海南粪泉蝇 is found in Wanning Xinglong, Hainan\",4\n3581,SOUTH ASIA,KHAO YAI,\"Khao Yai is a type locality in Thailand, part of South Asia\",4\n7167,DAFULING,FAN ET YAO,\"Tainanina yangchunensis, described by Fan et Yao, originates from Dafuling as the type locality\",4\n3580,SOUTH ASIA,SAYDAPET:GUINDY,\"Saydapet:Guindy is a type locality in India, part of South Asia\",3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
