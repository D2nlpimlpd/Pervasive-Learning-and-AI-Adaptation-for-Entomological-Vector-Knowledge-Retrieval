It is recognized as the **type locality** for *Eutrichota gigas*, a species whose classification and distribution are anchored to this specific location. Additionally, Tianmushan is associated with the presence of *Achoetandrus rufifacies*, a fly species documented in the region. The mountain is also a **distribution site** for the 1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly, a species likely cataloged under a specific taxonomic system, and *Atherigona triglomerata*, another fly species found in the area. \n\nTianmushan’s biodiversity extends to the *Muscidae* family, with the mountain noted as a location where subfamilies of this group are distributed. Specific species linked to the site include *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis*, a member of the blowfly genus *Lucilia*, and *Isomyia pichoni* and *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, both of which are part of the *Isomyia* genus. The *Lispe quaerens* fly is also documented as being distributed in Tianmushan. Furthermore, the mountain is the **domestic distribution site** for the *Xinglong Hemp Fly* (兴隆亚麻蝇), a species native to China. \n\nWhile one description incorrectly identifies Tianmushan as a \"\"city,\"\" the majority of sources consistently classify it as a **mountain**, resolving this contradiction. The mountain’s role as a hub for fly species highlights its ecological importance in the region, particularly for entomological research. Its association with multiple species across different genera and subfamilies underscores its value as a reference point for studying insect biodiversity in Zhejiang Province. \n\nIn summary, Tianmushan is a mountain in Zhejiang, China, renowned for its role as a type locality for *Eutrichota gigas* and as a distribution site for numerous fly species, including *Achoetandrus rufifacies*, the 1349 Slender-leaf Pierretia Fly, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis*, *Isomyia pichoni*, *Isomyia pseudolucilia*, *Lispe quaerens*, and the *Xinglong Hemp Fly*. These associations position Tianmushan as a critical location for understanding the taxonomy, ecology, and geographic range of flies in the region.

Zhejiang, located in eastern China, is known for its diverse ecosystems and agricultural significance, particularly in rice cultivation. HE JUNHUA’s connection to the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens suggests involvement in biological or ecological research, potentially related to plant or insect species native to the region. These specimens may represent a specific group of organisms or a research project focused on biodiversity, conservation, or agricultural pests.  \n\nAdditionally, HE JUNHUA’s association with the Rice Leafroller Moth in Zhejiang highlights their role in addressing a critical agricultural pest that threatens rice crops. The Rice Leafroller Moth is a significant insect in rice-growing areas, as its larvae feed on rice leaves, causing damage that reduces yields. Research on this species in Zhejiang likely centers on monitoring its population, understanding its life cycle, or developing pest management strategies to mitigate its impact on local agriculture. This work aligns with broader efforts in the province to sustain rice production, a staple of Zhejiang’s economy and food security.  \n\nWhile the descriptions do not explicitly clarify the relationship between the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens and the Rice Leafroller Moth, both associations underscore HE JUNHUA’s engagement with Zhejiang’s ecological and agricultural systems. The lack of direct overlap between the two topics implies that HE JUNHUA may contribute to multiple areas of study within the region, such as biodiversity documentation and pest control. Zhejiang’s role as a hub for both natural and agricultural research further contextualizes these associations, as the province supports initiatives to balance ecological preservation with sustainable farming practices.  \n\nIn summary, HE JUNHUA is linked to Zhejiang through their work on the Shuangban Jiewei Jiying specimens and the Rice Leafroller Moth, reflecting a dual focus on regional biodiversity and agricultural challenges. Their contributions likely support scientific understanding and practical solutions for Zhejiang’s ecosystems and rice industry, though the exact nature of their research on the specimens remains unspecified. The province of Zhejiang serves as a key location for these activities, emphasizing its importance in both ecological and agricultural contexts.\",108\n11011,LI XUELIU,ZHEJIANG,Li Xueling is associated with the Rice Borer in Zhejiang,108\n8167,伪绿等彩蝇,MALLOCH,Malloch described the species Isomyia pseudolucilia,68\n8171,伪绿等彩蝇,HUANGSHAN,Isomyia pseudolucilia is distributed in Huangshan,16\n8181,伪绿等彩蝇,XUEFENG MOUNTAIN,Isomyia pseudolucilia is distributed in Xuefeng Mountain,16\n2156,TIANMUSHAN,EUTRICHOTA GIGAS,Tianmushan in Zhejiang is the type locality for Eutrichota gigas,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
