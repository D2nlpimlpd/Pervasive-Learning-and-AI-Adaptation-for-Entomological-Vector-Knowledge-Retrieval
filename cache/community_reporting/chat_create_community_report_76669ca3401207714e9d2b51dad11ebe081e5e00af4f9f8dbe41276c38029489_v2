His 1983 survey in Fujian likely focused on ecological, biological, or environmental research, given the region’s significance for biodiversity and conservation studies. The 1984 report, attributed to him, further expands on species documentation or analysis, potentially building upon the findings from the earlier Fujian survey. While the specific subject of the 1984 report is not detailed, its connection to species suggests a focus on taxonomy, population dynamics, or habitat assessment. Yan Ruliang’s work in these years demonstrates an engagement with field research and academic reporting, contributing to scientific understanding in his area of expertise. The proximity of the two events (1983 survey and 1984 report) implies a sequential relationship, where the survey may have provided primary data for the subsequent publication.
