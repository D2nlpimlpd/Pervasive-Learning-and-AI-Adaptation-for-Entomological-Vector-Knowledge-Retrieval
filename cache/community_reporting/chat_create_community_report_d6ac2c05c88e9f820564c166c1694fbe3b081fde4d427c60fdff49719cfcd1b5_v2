These include the absence of wing side bristles and the presence of a single row of downward-curving bristles on the side face. The tribe is taxonomically defined by these traits, which serve as key identifiers in distinguishing it from other related groups. WAGNERIINI encompasses the genera *Periscepsia* and *Peteina*, both of which are integral to its classification. As part of the Tachininae subfamily, this tribe contributes to the broader understanding of tachinid fly diversity and evolutionary relationships. The specific morphological adaptations, such as the unique bristle patterns, likely play a role in the tribe’s ecological specialization or behavioral traits, though further research may be needed to clarify these aspects. Overall, WAGNERIINI represents a cohesive taxonomic unit within the subfamily, distinguished by its defining features and the inclusion of these two genera.\",3\n5868,PETEINA,\"\n\n**PETEINA** is a genus of flies first described by the entomologist Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1838. It belongs to the order Diptera, which includes true flies, and is characterized by specific morphological traits that distinguish it from other genera within its taxonomic group. Notably, members of *Peteina* are identified by the presence of a row of marginal bristles on the second abdominal tergite, a feature that contributes to their classification and ecological adaptation. Additionally, the genus is marked by a slender rostrum, a structural adaptation that may relate to feeding behaviors or habitat specialization. These defining characteristics, as outlined in the descriptions, provide a taxonomic basis for identifying *Peteina* species and understanding their evolutionary relationships. The genus remains a subject of study in entomology, particularly for its role in biodiversity and potential ecological functions. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the taxonomic authority (Meigen, 1838) and the morphological features.\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n11396,TACHININAE,WAGNERIINI,Wagneriini is a tribe within the Tachininae subfamily,11\n11461,PETEINA,WAGNERIINI,Peteina belongs to the tribe Wagneriini,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
