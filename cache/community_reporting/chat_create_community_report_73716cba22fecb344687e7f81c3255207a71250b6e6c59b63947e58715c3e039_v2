In 1982, Ni described multiple *Dasyphora* species, including *Dasyphora apicotaeniata*, *Dasyphora tianshanensis*, *Dasyphora gansuensis*, *Dasyphora albofasciata*, and *Dasyphora qinghaiensis*. These descriptions highlight his work on the biodiversity of this genus, with species names reflecting geographic or morphological distinctions. Additionally, Ni authored the 1982 description of *Neomyia (Orthellia) rufifacies*, a species also known by its Chinese name 绯颜翠蝇 (Crimson-faced Greenbottle Fly), and *Neomyia bristocercus*, another species within the same genus. His contributions extend to the *Morellia* genus, where he described *Morellia hainanensis* (海南莫蝇) and *Morellia suifenhensis* (绥芬河莫蝇) in 1982, further demonstrating his expertise in documenting regional insect fauna. While some descriptions reference specific species, others collectively note his role in describing \"\"multiple *Dasyphora* species,\"\" which aligns with the individual examples provided. All cited works are attributed to the year 1982, resolving any ambiguity about the timeline of his contributions. Ni’s research, spanning both scientific and Chinese nomenclature, underscores his focus on taxonomic clarity and regional ecological studies, particularly in Asia.
