These species are *Limnophora guizhouensis* and *Limnophora cyclocerca*. Their work contributed to the taxonomic understanding of this genus, particularly in the context of parasitic fly biodiversity. The descriptions of both species were published in the same year, highlighting their role in documenting new additions to the *Limnophora* lineage. While the specific details of their research methods or ecological significance of the species are not provided in the data, the fact that they were responsible for naming and classifying these two distinct species underscores their expertise in entomology and parasitoid taxonomy. The genus *Limnophora* is known for its role in biological control systems, as many of its members parasitize caterpillars and other insect larvae, making the identification of new species by researchers like ZHOU ET XUE valuable for ecological and agricultural studies. The 1987 publications likely represent part of a broader effort to catalog and classify parasitic flies, which are critical components of many ecosystems. By describing *L. guizhouensis* and *L. cyclocerca*, ZHOU ET XUE expanded the scientific record of *Limnophora* species, potentially aiding future research into their life cycles, host relationships, and conservation. The lack of additional context in the provided descriptions does not obscure the central fact that these two species were formally introduced to science by ZHOU ET XUE in 1987, establishing their contribution to the field. Their work may also reflect regional biodiversity studies, as the species names suggest a possible connection to Guizhou, a province in China known for its rich and diverse ecosystems. Overall, ZHOU ET XUE’s 1987 publications are significant milestones in the study of *Limnophora* and parasitic flies, providing foundational taxonomic data for subsequent investigations.\",3\n2713,LIMNOPHORA GUIZHOUENSIS,\"Species of fly described in 动物学研究, 8(2):111 (贵州池蝇)\",2\n2720,QIANLING MOUNTAIN,The type locality in Guizhou for Limnophora cyclocerca)|,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n4827,LIMNOPHORA CYCLOCERCA,ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Limnophora cyclocerca was described in the journal Zoological Research,30\n4797,ZHOU ET XUE,LIMNOPHORA GUIZHOUENSIS,Zhou and Xue described this species in 1987,5\n4829,LIMNOPHORA CYCLOCERCA,QIANLING MOUNTAIN,\"Limnophora cyclocerca is distributed in Qianling Mountain, Guizhou\",4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
