It hosts a diverse array of flies, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Frontina laeta*, *Helina calceataeformis* (specifically in Zhaowuda League, Chifeng), *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Muscina stabulans* and *Muscina angustifrons*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Sarcophaga variegata*, *Zenillia dolosa*, and the species *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *albiceps*. The region is also home to *Tachina nupta* and *Tachina albidopilosa*, as well as *Peteina erinaceus* and the Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly (*Lucilia illustris*). \n\nInner Mongolia’s fly fauna includes multiple genera and species documented in specific locations. For example, *Calliphora axata* is found in Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner and Hohhot, while *Calliphora genarum* occurs in the southeastern part (Naoxintai). The region supports *Chionomyia vetula* in Hohhot, *Cynomya mortuorum*, and *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*. Notable distributions include *Miltogrammoides zimini* and *Miltogramma* species, *Muscina assimilis* in Yitulihé, Tuluihé, and Genhé, and *Muscina* species in Jiagedaqi. The genera *Hydrophoria* (e.g., *Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*), *Strobilomyia* (e.g., *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Strobilomyia laricicola* in Ganhe and Guxuan), and *Parasarcophaga* are also documented. \n\nSpecific species with localized records include *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* in Alashan and Wuchuan Banner, *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (type locality in Hohhot, also in Beijing’s Wofosi, Yanqing), *1238黑条蝇* (Black-streaked Fly), *细角细麻蝇* (Narrow-horned Small House Fly), *1254钝叶污蝇* and *1256黑须污蝇* (Blunt-leaf and Black-bearded Filth Flies), and *731 BINGLU FLY* (Binglu Fly). The region is a type locality for *1341细角细麻蝇* and *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae*. Additional species include *Austrophorocera*, *Barbata Fannia*, *Bayan Wohlfahrtia* (Bayanhote), *Alashan Wohlfahrtia* (Alashan Banner), *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus*, *Voria ruralis*, *Oestromyia* (including *O. tarandi* in the northern Greater Khingan Range), and *1281毛股折麻蝇* (Hairy-thighed Folded Fly). \n\nInner Mongolia’s biodiversity extends to *Phaenicia* species like *Phaonia jagedaqiensis* and *Phaonia malaisei*, as well as *Phaonia changbaishanensis* and *Phaonia beizhenesis* in Guyuan. The genera *Zaira* and *Meigenia* are present in Dongwuqi, while *Meigenia grandigena* is specifically found there. *Subhylemyia lineola* and *Blaesoxipha litoralis* occur in the region, alongside *Dasyphora trichosterna*, *Dasyphora asiatica*, and *Dasyphora albofasciata*. *Delia* species such as *Delia sphaerobasis* (Ejina Banner, Lanzhou Medical College) and *Delia bisetosa* are documented, as are *Miltogramma bimaculatum* and *Miltogramma tibitum*. \n\nThe region is also notable for *Fannia scalaris* and *Fannia subscalaris*, *Gonia bimaculata*, *Muscina recta*, *Muscina sorbens*, *Muscina tempestiva*, and *Polleniopsis mongolica*. *Protocalliphora lii*, *Prosena* genus, *Brontaea* species, and *Servaisia rossica* are found here. *Exorista larvarum* and *Haematobia titillans* (Biting Fly) are distributed in Inner Mongolia, as are *Jining*, *Tumertei*, *Linhe*, *Siziwang Banner*, and *Xilingol League* as specific locations for multiple fly species. The autonomous region is further associated with *KENT’S SARCOPHAGA*, *SHUANG YANGYING*, and *Caesar Greenbottle Fly*, as well as *Blaesoxipha unicolor* in Keshiketeng Banner and *Agriella gobica* in the western Gobi Desert. Studies on host relationships of fly species have been conducted in the region, underscoring its ecological importance for entomological research. \n\nThis summary consolidates Inner Mongolia’s role as a key domestic distribution area for over 50 fly species, emphasizing its status as an autonomous region in northern China with diverse habitats supporting both common and regionally unique taxa. Contradictions in the data (e.g., references to \"\"province\"\" vs. \"\"autonomous region\"\") are resolved by consistently using \"\"autonomous region\"\" to align with official classifications.\",163\n5918,\"HORAE SOC,ENT.ROSS.\",A journal publishing research on the species Tachina albidopilosa,4\n4646,1257陈氏污蝇,\"1257陈氏污蝇 (Wohlfahrtia cheni) is a species of fly named after researcher Chen, with documented distribution in Inner Mongolia and the Soviet Union\",4\n3189,HELINA PARCEPILOSA,\"A species of fly described by Stein in 1907, found in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Gansu, and internationally in the Soviet Union, Europe, and Poland (mode origin).

It serves as a distribution site for several species within the genus *Helina*, including *Helina parcepilosa*, *Helina calceataeformis*, and *Helina obscuratoides*. Additionally, the species *Halina moedlingensis* is noted as being distributed in Poland, though this may represent a typographical variation of *Helina* (a genus in the family Muscidae) and requires further clarification. The country also hosts *Coenosia octopunctata* and *Coenosia flavicornis*, both members of the *Coenosia* genus, as well as *Haematobia titillans* (the horn fly) and *Musca larvipara* (a species of housefly). *Pollenia pectinata*, a blow fly, is similarly reported in Poland. The genus *Sinonipponia*, though less commonly referenced, is also documented as occurring in the region. Furthermore, the genus *Helicophagella* is described as being distributed in Poland, though the term \"\"foreign country\"\" in this context may be an error, as all other descriptions explicitly reference Poland as the location. Finally, the data highlights that Poland is a country where at least one species exhibits international distribution, though the specific species is not named. These findings underscore Poland’s ecological significance as a habitat for both native and internationally distributed insect taxa, contributing to broader biodiversity studies in Europe. The summary consolidates all provided information, resolving potential typographical inconsistencies (e.g., \"\"Halina\"\" likely intended as *Helina*) and emphasizing the country’s role in the geographic range of these species.
