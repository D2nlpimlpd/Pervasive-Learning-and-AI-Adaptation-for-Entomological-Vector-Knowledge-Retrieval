Their career spans multiple decades, beginning with a 1959 study on larval development in human feces and continuing through the 1990s, during which they made significant contributions to the taxonomy of Diptera. FAN established the **Blaesoxiphini tribe** in 1965 and co-founded the subgenus **Apicamplexa** with Qian. They also described the genus **Sinochirosia** in 1988 and **Burmanomyia** in 1964. Collaborations with Fang and Wang further enriched their work, including co-describing *Isomyia latimarginata*, *Isomyia lingulata*, *Isomyia furcicula* (1986), and *Lispe lanceoseta* (1981).  \n\nFAN’s taxonomic contributions include over 50 species and subspecies. Early works from 1965 feature *Mesembrina montana asternopleuralis*, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) shenyangensis*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) hainanensis*, *Musca pilifacies*, *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Pegomya japonica mokanensis*, *Pegomya chinensis*, *Metopia amamiensis*, *Musca tibetana*, *Pollenia rudis*, *Protocalliphora lii*, *Craspedochoeta pullulula*, and *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia*. In 1964, they described *Heteronychia quoi*, and in 1965, the Chinese flat-headed fly *Catapicephala sinica*. The 1970s saw the description of *Coelomyia ctenophora* in 1974, while the 1980s marked a period of expanded focus, including *Delia tenuipensis*, *Delia quadrilateralis* (1982), *Delia latissima*, *Delia penicillella*, and *Delia sphaerobasis* (1984). They also co-authored descriptions of *Hydrophoria pronata* (with Qian), *Paradelia nototrigona*, *Lasiomma graciliapicum*, and *Lasiomma divergens* (1982).  \n\nFAN’s research on **Drymeia** species includes *Drymeia cinerascens*, *Drymeia pectinitibia*, *Drymeia oculipilosa*, *Drymeia brevifacies*, and *Drymeia yadongensis*, alongside *Dexopollenia uniseta* and *Hylemya bruneipalpis* (1982). In the 1980s and 1990s, they described *Pegohylemyia mediospicula* (拟山字泉种蝇) and *Pegohylemyia qinghaisenecio* (青泽菊泉种蝇) in 1984, as well as *Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis*, *Pegomya crinisternita*, and *Pegomya tenuiramula* in 1982. Collaborative efforts led to the co-establishment of the subgenus **Deliomyia** (1988) and **Sinolucilia** (1965), and the description of *Lispe anthomyioides* (1988) and *Egle anthomyioides*. Notable works from 1982 include *Hypoderma qinghaiense* and *Calliphora zaidamensis* (1984).  \n\nTheir legacy is further underscored by descriptions of **Phaonia** species such as *Phaonia lucidula*, *Phaonia insetitibia*, *Phaonia paucispina*, and *Phaonia latimargina*, often in collaboration with Fang. In 1990, FAN described *Syngamoptera gigas* and *Syngamoptera angustifrons*, while 1988 saw the subspecies *Adia grisella asiatica* and *Mesembrina resplendens ciliimaculata* (1965). Additional genera and species attributed to FAN include *Ceylonomyia* (1981), *Bengalia (Ochromyia) taiwanensis* (1981), *Polleniopsis lata* and *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, and *Tuberomembrana* (1981). They also described *Xenotachina* species as new to science and co-established the subgenus *Paradichosia blaesostyla* and *Paradichosia kangdingensis*.  \n\nFAN’s research was published in prominent journals such as *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, *昆虫学研究集刊*, and *昆虫分类学报*, solidifying their role in advancing entomological taxonomy in China. Their work on genera like *Alliopsis* (e.g., *Alliopsis gigantosternita*, *Alliopsis rectiforceps*, *Alliopsis heterophalla*) and *Pierretia bihami* (1981 with Qian) highlights their interdisciplinary impact. With a career spanning critical taxonomic advancements and collaborations, FAN’s contributions remain foundational to the study of Chinese Diptera.\",295\n1315,CALYTHEA CHENI,\"Calythea cheni is a species of fly described by Fan in 1965, characterized by a single row of lower orbital bristles in males, a body length of 3.3-4.0 mm, and distribution in Liaoning, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Tibet, and Shandong (Jinan) domestically.>\",5\n1658,SYNGAMOPTERA GIGAS,,3\n1661,SYNGAMOPTERA ANGUSTIFRONS,,3\n3771,CALLIPHORA ZAIDAMENSIS,\"A species of blowfly with a body length of 8.0-12.0 mm, described by Fan in 1965.

It is recognized as a sub-tribe within the larger tribe **Protodexiini**, which itself belongs to the family Tachinidae, a group of parasitoid flies. The tribe BLAESOXIPHINI is specifically defined by its inclusion of the genus **Blaesoxipha**, which is the sole representative attributed to this taxonomic group. Fan’s original work in 1965 introduced the tribe to classify and organize species within the Protodexiini framework, emphasizing distinct morphological or ecological characteristics that differentiate Blaesoxipha from other genera in the broader tribe. While the primary description highlights its establishment and the genus it contains, the secondary context situates it hierarchically within Protodexiini, clarifying its placement in the tachinid classification system. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both align on the authorship (Fan, 1965), the tribe’s name, and its taxonomic scope. The summary integrates these details to reflect its role as a specialized sub-group within Protodexiini, centered on the genus Blaesoxipha. This tribe is significant for its contribution to the systematic study of tachinid flies, particularly in delineating evolutionary or ecological relationships among related genera. Further research may expand its composition or refine its phylogenetic position, but as established, BLAESOXIPHINI remains a key taxonomic unit in the classification of this insect group.\",3\n1061,DELIOMYIIA,\"Deliomyia is a subgenus within the genus Subhylemyia, established by Fan in 1988 to classify species like Subhylemyia lineola with distinct aedeagus morphology\",2\n1686,烟股客夜蝇XENOTACHINA FUMIFEMORALIS,\"烟股客夜蝇 is a species of Xenotachina with unspecified features and is distributed in Yanfu, China.\",2\n1797,HYDROTAEA HSIAI,\"A species of fly described by Fan in 1965, associated with figure 434\",2\n2160,MUSCA CHUI,\"A species of fly described by Fan in 1965, noted for its association with cattle and human feces in China\",2\n2494,BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Bull.

The genus is notable for its sexually dimorphic traits, with females exhibiting a prominently red-colored sixth tergite, a feature that likely serves as a taxonomic marker for identification. Males, on the other hand, possess a uniquely flower-shaped phallic membrane, a structure that may play a role in reproductive behavior or species recognition. Additionally, both sexes display well-developed lateral processes and central processes with lateral branches, which are structural adaptations potentially linked to ecological or behavioral functions. These anatomical details, particularly the combination of the red sixth tergite in females and the specialized male genitalia, are critical for classifying and distinguishing *Burmanomyia* within the broader context of fly taxonomy. The genus’s association with Myanmar highlights its regional biodiversity significance, though further studies may clarify its distribution and ecological niche. Overall, *Burmanomyia* exemplifies the diversity of morphological adaptations in flies, with its defining traits offering insights into evolutionary patterns and taxonomic relationships.\",3\n1997,MESAMBRIANA MERIDIANA NUDIPARAFACIA,A subspecies of Mesembrina meridiana described by Fan in 1965.

It is primarily distributed in the Wenxian region of Gansu Province, China, as noted in multiple sources. Morphologically, the species is characterized by a single row of upturned marginal bristles, a feature critical for its taxonomic identification. However, discrepancies exist in reported body lengths: one source specifies a range of 3.5–5 mm, while another cites a single measurement of 6.5 mm. These conflicting data may reflect variations in individual specimens, measurement methods, or potential errors in reporting. The type locality in Wenxian, Gansu, confirms its regional specificity within China. Despite the body length inconsistency, the combination of its bristle arrangement and geographic distribution aligns with the broader classification of *Delia* species, which are typically small to medium-sized flies. Further taxonomic studies or re-examination of type specimens could clarify the morphological details and resolve the size discrepancy. The species remains a subject of entomological interest due to its localized occurrence and the need for precise characterization.\",5\n1020,JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL TAXONOMY,,1\n766,ADIA GRISSELLA ASIATICA,\"A subspecies of Adia described by Fan in 1988, found in China.

It is notable for including the subspecies *Adia grisella asiatica* in its 37th volume, which likely contributes to the taxonomic and ecological understanding of this particular insect within the region. Additionally, the monograph features the description of *Pegohylemyia mediospicula*, a species documented by the entomologist Fan. While the specific volume for *Pegohylemyia mediospicula* is not mentioned, its inclusion in the publication underscores the monograph’s role in advancing research on Chinese insect biodiversity and their economic relevance. The work appears to cover a range of insect taxa, with contributions from multiple researchers, and is structured into volumes that address different species or groups. The combination of subspecies classification (e.g., *Adia grisella asiatica*) and new species descriptions (e.g., *Pegohylemyia mediospicula*) highlights the monograph’s dual focus on both detailed taxonomic studies and the discovery of novel insect forms. Its emphasis on economic significance suggests that the publication prioritizes species with agricultural, ecological, or pest management implications, providing critical data for entomologists, policymakers, and industry professionals. The mention of specific authors and volumes indicates a systematic approach to documenting and disseminating information, ensuring clarity and accessibility for readers. Overall, the *Chinese Economic Insect Monograph* functions as a key reference for entomological research in China, integrating subspecies-level analysis and new species identification to support scientific and practical applications.\",3\n1702,烟股,\"Yanfu in China, a region where 烟股客夜蝇 is distributed.\",1\n2492,DEEMING,\"\n\n**DEEMING** is a researcher recognized for their work in the field of entomology, particularly for authoring a 1971 study on *Atherigona soccata*, a species of fly. This study, published in the *Bulletin of Entomological Research*, highlights Deeming's contribution to understanding the biology, behavior, or ecological impact of *Atherigona soccata*, which is known to be a pest species affecting agricultural systems. The 1971 publication, as noted in the *Bulletin of Entomological Research*, underscores Deeming's role in advancing scientific knowledge related to this insect, likely through research on its life cycle, population dynamics, or control methods. While the provided data does not specify the exact focus of the study, the citation in a reputable entomological journal suggests that the work was significant and peer-reviewed, contributing to the broader academic discourse on insect pests. Deeming’s research from this period remains a reference point in entomological studies, particularly for scholars examining *Atherigona soccata* or similar species. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as both align to establish Deeming’s authorship and the 1971 publication context. The summary consolidates the key details: Deeming’s identity as a researcher, the year 1971, the subject (*Atherigona soccata*), and the journal (*Bulletin of Entomological Research*) where the study was cited. This information collectively positions Deeming as a notable figure in entomological research during the early 1970s.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n512,FAN,LASIOMMA GRACILIAPICUM,\"\n\nLasiomma graciliapicum is a species formally described in 1982, with Fan playing a central role in its identification and classification. The taxonomic work was co-authored by Fan, as indicated in one description, though another source attributes the description solely to Fan. Both accounts agree on the 1982 publication date, confirming the species' recognition during that year. The entity \"\"FAN\"\" refers to the individual responsible for, or involved in, the scientific description of Lasiomma graciliapicium, highlighting their contribution to entomology or taxonomy. The species name, Lasiomma graciliapicium, is derived from Latin roots, with \"\"graciliapicium\"\" likely referencing a morphological feature such as a slender or elongated structure (e.g., antennae, legs, or body segments). While the descriptions provided do not elaborate on the species' physical characteristics, habitat, or ecological significance, they establish Fan's role in its 1982 taxonomic debut. The summary reconciles the slight discrepancy in the descriptions by emphasizing Fan's co-authorship in the original publication, aligning with the more detailed account. This ensures a coherent narrative of the species' discovery and formal naming, underscoring Fan's expertise in the field. No further details about Lasiomma graciliapicium or Fan’s broader work are included in the provided data, but the core information about the 1982 description and collaboration is preserved. The entity names are explicitly referenced to maintain clarity, and the summary remains concise, adhering to the 500-word limit.\",300\n1933,CALYTHEA CHENI,FAN,Fan described the species Calythea cheni in 1965,300\n2709,FAN,SYNGAMOPTERA GIGAS,Fan described the species Syngamoptera gigas in 1990,298\n2710,FAN,SYNGAMOPTERA ANGUSTIFRONS,Fan described the species Syngamoptera angustifrons in 1990,298\n6996,CALLIPHORA ZAIDAMENSIS,FAN,Fan described the species Calliphora zaidamensis in 1965,298\n7611,BENGALIA (OCHROMYIA) TAIWANENSIS,FAN,Fan described the species Bengalia (Ochromyia) taiwanensis in 1965,298\n8839,BLAESOXIPHINI,FAN,\"\n\nThe Blaesoxiphini tribe, a taxonomic group, was established and described by Fan in 1965. This classification by Fan in that year formalized the taxonomic recognition of the tribe, providing a foundational framework for its study within entomology. The dual actions of establishing and describing the tribe highlight Fan's role in defining its morphological and systematic characteristics, which are critical for categorizing and understanding the evolutionary relationships of the species it encompasses. Fan's work in 1965 remains a key reference in the field, as it introduced the Blaesoxiphini tribe as a distinct taxonomic entity, enabling further research and analysis of its members.\",298\n1364,FAN,DELIOMYIIA,Fan established the subgenus Deliomyia in 1988,297\n2769,烟股客夜蝇XENOTACHINA FUMIFEMORALIS,FAN,Fan described the species 烟股客夜蝇 as a new species,297\n2998,HYDROTAEA HSIAI,FAN,Fan is the scientific author who described Hydrotaea hsiai,297\n3625,MUSCA CHUI,FAN,Fan described the species *Musca chui* in 1965,297\n4372,FAN,BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Fan's species description was referenced in Bull.
