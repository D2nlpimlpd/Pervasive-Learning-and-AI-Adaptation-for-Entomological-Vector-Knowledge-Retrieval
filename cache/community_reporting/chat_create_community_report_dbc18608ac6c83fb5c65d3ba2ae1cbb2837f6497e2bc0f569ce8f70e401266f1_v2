The county's ecological and geographical characteristics have contributed to its role in the scientific documentation of these species. *Hydrotaea bimaculatoides*, a fly species within the genus *Hydrotaea*, is specifically noted for having its type locality established in Hequ, meaning the original specimens used to define the species were collected there. Similarly, *Lispe lanceoseta*, a member of the genus *Lispe* (family Syrphidae), was described based on observations or specimens from the same area, underscoring the county's importance in the study of syrphid flies. These associations highlight Hequ County as a key location for biodiversity research in Shanxi, particularly in the context of dipteran taxonomy. The convergence of these two species' records in the region suggests that Hequ County may harbor unique or representative habitats for such insects, though further ecological studies would be needed to confirm this.
