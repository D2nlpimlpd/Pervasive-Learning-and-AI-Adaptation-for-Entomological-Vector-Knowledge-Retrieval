The journal, titled *动物学研究* in Chinese (translating to \"\"Zoological Research\"\"), has published significant works, including the formal description of the fly species *Spilogona changbaishanensis* in 1981. This species, a member of the genus *Spilogona* within the family Syrphidae, was documented in the journal as part of its role in advancing taxonomic research on insects. Additionally, *Animal Studies* has served as a platform for specialized publications, such as a supplement dedicated to *Parasarcophaga*, a genus of parasitic flies. These contributions highlight the journal’s focus on both foundational and niche studies within entomology, emphasizing its importance in cataloging and analyzing diverse animal life forms. The journal’s bilingual identity (English and Chinese titles) suggests a regional or international scope, potentially bridging research communities in China and beyond. While the 1981 description of *Spilogona changbaishanensis* and the *Parasarcophaga* supplement are distinct publications, they collectively underscore *Animal Studies* as a resource for detailed, scientific exploration of animal species and their ecological roles. The journal’s commitment to publishing both primary taxonomic work and supplementary materials reflects its adaptability to varied research needs in zoological sciences. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as they reference separate publications by the same journal.
