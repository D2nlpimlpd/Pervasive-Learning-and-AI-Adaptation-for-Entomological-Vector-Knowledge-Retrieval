The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. I need to go back through the provided text and make sure I didn't overlook any. The entity types are organization, person, geo, and event. \n\nFirst, looking at the text again. There are several fly species mentioned with their authors and distribution. The previous extraction included some authors as persons and countries/regions as geo. But maybe I missed some other authors or locations.\n\nStarting with the first part: 度尼西亚，伊里安，埃及. These are Indonesia, Irian, and Egypt. I already included Indonesia and Egypt as geo, but Irian might be a typo. Wait, in the text, it's mentioned as \"Irian\" which could be \"Irian Jaya\" or \"Papua New Guinea\". But the user might have intended it as a region. I'll check if there's more context. The text later mentions \"Irian\" again in the distribution of some species. So I should include Irian as a geo entity.\n\nNext, the species and their authors. For example, \"Limnophora exigua (Wiedemann)\" – Wiedemann is a person. I already included Wiedemann. Then \"Limnophora nigripes (Robineau-Desvoidy)\" – Robineau-Desvoidy is a person. Also included. \"Limnophora apiciseta Emden\" – Emden is a person. Included. \"Limnophora glaucescens Emden\" – same Emden. \"Limnophora setinervoides Ma, 1981\" – Ma is a person. Included. \"Limnophora tigrina tigrina (Am Stein, 1860)\" – Am Stein is a person. Included. \"Limnophora himalayensis Brunetti, 1907\" – Brunetti is a person. Included. \"Limnophora pandellei Seguy, 1923\" – Seguy is a person. Included. \"Limnophora brunneisquama Mu et Chen\" – Mu and Chen are persons. Included. \n\nNow, the distributions. For example, \"国内：辽宁（本溪），黑龙江（哈尔滨，Hennig,1960)\" – Hennig is a person. I missed Hennig in the previous extraction. So I need to add Hennig as a person. \n\nLooking at the other distributions: \"国外：欧洲（法国（模式产地））, 苏联（外高加索），和北美。\" – Europe, France (type locality), USSR (Caucasus), and North America. France and USSR were included, but maybe the Caucasus as a separate geo entity. Wait, in the previous output, I had \"CAUCASUS\" as a geo entity under USSR. But the text mentions \"外高加索\" which is the Caucasus region. So that's already covered. \n\nThen there's \"分布 国内：贵州（贵阳）；国外：缅甸（模式产地为缅甸东北部），印度。\" – Guizhou (Guiyang) is a domestic location. I missed Guiyang in the previous extraction. So add Guizhou and Guiyang as geo entities. \n\nAnother part: \"分布 国内：台湾（模式产地），广东（大雾岭），海南（兴隆）；国外：印度尼西亚，缅甸，泰国，马来西亚 ，印度（北部）。” – Taiwan, Guangdong (Dawuling), Hainan (Xinglong) are already included. But maybe the other countries like Thailand and Malaysia were missed. The user's example 2 included Vision Holdings and TechGlobal, so I need to check if all countries in the distribution are captured. \n\nLooking at the text again, the countries mentioned in distributions are: Indonesia, Irian, Egypt, France, USSR, North America, Myanmar, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia. Wait, in the text, for example, \"国外：印度尼西亚，缅甸，泰国，马来西亚 ，印度（北部）。” – Thailand and Malaysia are there. Did I include them? In the previous output, I had Indonesia, Irian, Egypt, USSR, Myanmar, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka. So Thailand and Malaysia are missing. Need to add those as geo entities. \n\nAlso, the text mentions \"欧洲（法国（模式产地））\" – Europe and France. France is included, but maybe Europe as a separate geo entity. The previous output had \"EUROPE\" in a relationship with Seguy. So Europe should be a geo entity. \n\nLooking at the relationships, the user's example 3 had multiple relationships between countries and persons. In the previous output, I linked authors to their species' type localities and distributions. But maybe there are more relationships between the species and their distributions. For example, each species is found in certain locations. The user might want to capture that as a relationship. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related. So for each species, the countries/regions where they are distributed are related. For example, Limnophora nigripes is distributed in France, USSR, and North America. So the author Robineau-Desvoidy is related to those countries. But also, the species itself is related to those countries. \n\nIn the previous output, I had relationships between authors and their type localities, but maybe I should also have relationships between the species and the countries where they are found. For example, \"Limnophora nigripes\" is related to France, USSR, and North America. But the user's example 2 had TechGlobal and Vision Holdings as organizations. However, in this case, the species are not organizations but part of the entity types. Wait, the entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The species are not in these types. So the species themselves are not entities to be extracted. \n\nWait, the user's examples included species as entities. For example, in example 1, \"Central Institution\" is an organization, and \"Market Strategy Committee\" is another. But in the current task, the entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The species names like Limnophora nigripes are not in these types. So maybe the species are not to be extracted as entities. \n\nBut the user's examples also included \"Limnophora tigrina tigrina\" as part of the entity name. Wait, in example 3, the entities are countries and persons. The species names are part of the entity_description but not as entities themselves. So in this case, the species are not entities. \n\nTherefore, the main entities are the countries/regions (geo), the authors (person), and the journal (organization). \n\nLooking back, I missed some countries like Thailand and Malaysia. Also, the person Hennig was mentioned in the distribution of Limnophora nigripes. So need to add Hennig as a person. \n\nAdditionally, the journal \"动物分类学报\" is Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica. The previous output included that as an organization. \n\nNow, checking the relationships again. The previous output had relationships between authors and their type localities, and between authors and the journal. But maybe there are more relationships between the journal and the species. For example, the journal published the descriptions of the species. But since the species aren't entities, that's not necessary. \n\nWait, the user's example 1 had \"TechGlobal\" as an organization. So in this case, the species are not organizations. So the only entities are the geo locations, persons (authors and Hennig), and the journal. \n\nSo the missing entities are Thailand, Malaysia, and Hennig. \n\nFor relationships, the previous output had authors linked to their type localities and the journal. But maybe the journal is also linked to the countries where the species are found. For example, the journal is referenced in the distribution of species in certain countries. But the user's example 2 had Vision Holdings and TechGlobal as organizations, but here the journal is the only organization. \n\nSo the main relationships are between authors and their type localities, and between the journal and the authors. \n\nWait, in the text, the journal is cited in the publication of species descriptions. For example, \"动物分类学报，6(4), p.413, 414, 图(1一3)\" – this is Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica. So the journal is related to the authors who published in it. \n\nIn the previous output, I had relationships between authors and the journal. But maybe I missed some. For example, the entry for Limnophora setinervoides mentions \"动物分类学报\" but in the previous output, I linked Ma to the journal. \n\nWait, the text for Limnophora setinervoides says \"动物分类学报，6(4), p.413, 414, 图(1一3)\" – so the journal is Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica. The author is Ma. So the relationship between Ma and the journal is already there. \n\nBut looking at the other species, like Limnophora tigrina tigrina, the text says \"Suppl,Ent,,4: 30-31\" – which is a supplement, but the main journal is Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica. So Am Stein is linked to the journal. \n\nSimilarly, for Limnophora himalayensis, the text says \"Rec. Ind.Mus., 1:382,\" – which is a different journal, but the user's example 3 included Quintara as a geo entity. Wait, in the current text, the journal is \"动物分类学报\" (Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica) and other references like \"Suppl,Ent,,4: 30-31\" and \"Rec. Ind.Mus., 1:382,\" but the user's instruction says to only emit entities that match the types. So those other journals (Suppl,Ent and Rec. Ind.Mus.) are not in the entity types, so they shouldn't be included. \n\nTherefore, the only organization is Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica. \n\nNow, the missing entities are Thailand, Malaysia, and Hennig. \n\nFor relationships, the previous output had authors linked to their type localities and the journal. But maybe the journal is also linked to the countries where the species are described. For example, the journal is referenced in the distribution of species in certain countries. But since the countries are already entities, and the journal is an organization, perhaps there's a relationship between the journal and the countries. However, the user's examples didn't include such relationships. The relationships were between authors and countries, and authors and the journal. \n\nSo I need to check if there are any other relationships between the authors and the countries where the species are found. For example, if an author is linked to a country where their species is distributed. \n\nIn the text, for example, Limnophora setinervoides is distributed in USSR (Caucasus). The author is Ma. So the relationship between Ma and USSR/Caucasus is already there. \n\nAnother example: Limnophora tigrina tigrina is distributed in Taiwan, Guangdong, Hainan. The author is Am Stein. So the relationship between Am Stein and Taiwan is already there. \n\nBut the user's example 3 had relationships between countries and other countries (e.g., Quintara and Firuzabad). In this case, the countries are related through the distribution of the species. For example, Indonesia is mentioned as a country where some species are found, and the same species are also in other countries. So maybe there's a relationship between Indonesia and those other countries. But the user's examples didn't do that. The relationships were between authors and countries, and between countries and other countries if they were involved in an event. \n\nWait, in example 3, the countries were related through a hostage exchange event. Here, the countries are related through the distribution of species. But the entity type \"event\" is included. So perhaps the distribution of a species in a country is an event. But the user's examples didn't use \"event\" as an entity. For example, in example 1, the event was the meeting and policy decision. \n\nIn the current text, the main events are the publication of species descriptions in the journal. But the user's entity types include \"event\", so maybe the publication is an event. However, the user's examples didn't extract events in the same way. For example, in example 2, the event was the IPO. \n\nBut in the current text, the events are the publication of the species in the journal. So perhaps each species' description in the journal is an event. However, the user's examples didn't do that. The user's examples focused on the relationships between authors and countries, and between authors and the journal. \n\nSo maybe the user expects only the authors and countries as entities, and the relationships between them. \n\nTherefore, the missing entities are Thailand, Malaysia, and Hennig. \n\nAdding those:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>THAILAND<|>GEO<|>Thailand is a country where certain species of flies are distributed.  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALAYSIA<|>GEO<|>Malaysia is a country where certain species of flies are distributed.  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HENNIG<|>PERSON<|>Henning is a person cited in the distribution of Limnophora nigripes in Liaoning.  \n##\n\nFor relationships, the previous output had Robineau-Desvoidy linked to France, USSR, and North America. But in the text, the distribution for Limnophora nigripes is \"国外：欧洲（法国（模式产地））, 苏联（外高加索），和北美。\" So the author Robineau-Desvoidy is linked to Europe (as a region), France (type locality), USSR (Caucasus), and North America. But in the previous output, the relationships were between Robineau-Desvoidy and France, USSR, and North America. However, the text mentions \"欧洲（法国（模式产地））\" which is Europe (France (type locality)). So maybe Europe should be a separate geo entity. \n\nIn the previous output, I had \"EUROPE\" in a relationship with Seguy. So adding Europe as a geo entity. \n\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>Europe is a region where certain species of flies are distributed, including France as the type locality for some species.  \n##\n\nThen, the relationships between Robineau-Desvoidy and Europe, France, USSR, and North America. But in the previous output, Robineau-Desvoidy was linked to France, USSR, and North America. So need to add the relationship between Robineau-Desvoidy and Europe. \n\nAlso, the text mentions \"欧洲（模式产地）\" for some species, so Europe as a type locality. \n\nAnother relationship: Hennig is linked to Liaoning (Benxi, Harbin) for Limnophora nigripes. So adding the relationship between Hennig and Liaoning. \n\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENNIG<|>LIAONING<|>Henning is cited in the distribution of Limnophora nigripes in Liaoning<|>7)  \n##\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions \"模式产地\" (type locality) for some species. For example, Limnophora tigrina tigrina has type locality in Taiwan. So the relationship between Am Stein and Taiwan is already there. \n\nBut for Limnophora himalayensis, the type locality is India. So Brunetti is linked to India. \n\nFor Limnophora pandellei, the synonym is Limnophora orbitalis, with type locality in Qinghai. So Seguy is linked to Europe (as the type locality for the synonym), but the text says \"分布 国内：辽宁（本溪、建昌、兴城、锦县），河北（都山），山西（雁北），陕西(眉县），青海（模式产地）。” So the type locality is Qinghai. So the relationship between Seguy and Qinghai is already there. \n\nWait, in the previous output, the relationship between Seguy and Europe was mentioned, but the type locality is Qinghai. So maybe the relationship between Seguy and Qinghai is stronger. \n\nBut the user's example 3 had relationships between countries and other countries. Here, the relationships are between authors and countries. \n\nSo the main missing entities are Thailand, Malaysia, and Hennig. \n\nAdding those entities and the corresponding relationships. For example, Limnophora tigrina tigrina is distributed in Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and India. The author is Am Stein. So relationships between Am Stein and Thailand, Malaysia. \n\nSimilarly, other authors might be linked to these countries. \n\nWait, the text for Limnophora tigrina tigrina says \"国外：印度尼西亚，缅甸，泰国，马来西亚 ，印度（北部）。” So the author is Am Stein. So the relationships would be:\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>AM STEIN<|>THAILAND<|>Am Stein is the author of Limnophora tigrina tigrina, which is distributed in Thailand<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AM STEIN<|>MALAYSIA<|>Am Stein is the author of Limnophora tigrina tigrina, which is distributed in Malaysia<|>7)  \n##\n\nAlso, for other species, check if their authors are linked to the countries in their distribution. For example, Limnophora setinervoides is distributed in USSR (Caucasus). The author is Ma. So the relationship between Ma and USSR/Caucasus is already there. \n\nAnother example: Limnophora brunneisquama is distributed in Qinghai. The authors are Mu and Chen. So the relationship between Mu and Chen and Qinghai is already there. \n\nSo the main missing relationships are between Am Stein and Thailand, Malaysia. \n\nAlso, the author Seguy is linked to Europe (as the type locality for the synonym Limnophora pandellei). So adding:\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEGUIY<|>EUROPE<|>Seguy is the author of Limnophora pandellei, a synonym for Limnophora orbitalis, which is distributed in Europe<|>7)  \n##\n\nBut in the previous output, Seguy was already linked to Europe. \n\nWait, in the previous output, the relationship between Seguy and Europe was:\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEGUIY<|>EUROPE<|>Seguy's work is referenced in the journal Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica<|>6)  \n\nBut the actual reason is that the synonym Limnophora pandellei is distributed in Europe. So the relationship should be between Seguy and Europe. \n\nSo adding that. \n\nAlso, the text mentions \"欧洲\" (Europe) as a distribution region for some species. For example, Limnophora orbitalis is distributed in Europe. The author is Seguy. So the relationship between Seguy and Europe is already there. \n\nAnother author, Wiedemann, is linked to Indonesia. The text says \"国外：欧洲（法国（模式产地））, 苏联（外高加索），和北美。\" for Limnophora nigripes. Wait, no, Limnophora exigua is the one with Wiedemann. The text for Limnophora exigua is part of the distribution in Indonesia, Irian, and Egypt. So the author Wiedemann is linked to those countries. \n\nIn the previous output, Wiedemann was linked to Indonesia, Irian, and Egypt. But the text for Limnophora exigua says \"分布国内：辽宁（本溪），黑龙江（哈尔滨，Hennig,1960)。国外：欧洲（法国（模式产地））, 苏联（外高加索），和北美。” So the author Wiedemann is linked to Europe (France), USSR (Caucasus), and North America. But in the previous output, the relationship between Wiedemann and Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica was missing. \n\nWait, the user's example 1 had the journal as an entity. In the current text, the journal \"动物分类学报\" is Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica. The previous output included the journal as an organization and linked authors to it. But for Wiedemann, the relationship to the journal was missing. \n\nSo adding:\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIEDEMANN<|>ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA<|>Wiedemann's work is referenced in the journal Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica<|>6)  \n##\n\nSimilarly, for other authors like Robineau-Desvoidy, Emden, Ma, Am Stein, Brunetti, Seguy, Mu and Chen, need to check if they are linked to the journal. \n\nIn the previous output, Robineau-Desvoidy, Emden, Ma, Am Stein, Brunetti, Seguy, and Mu and Chen were linked to the journal. But Wiedemann was not. So adding that. \n\nAlso, the text mentions \"Suppl,Ent,,4: 30-31\" and \"Rec. Ind.Mus., 1:382,\" but those are other journals, not in the entity types. So they shouldn't be included. \n\nSo the missing entities are Thailand, Malaysia, and Hennig. \n\nAdding those entities and the relationships between their authors and the countries. \n\nAlso, the journal is linked to Wiedemann. \n\nSo the final entities to add are:\n\n- THAILAND (GEO)\n- MALAYSIA (GEO)\n- HENNIG (PERSON)\n\nAnd the relationships:\n\n- Wiedemann to Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica\n- Am Stein to Thailand and Malaysia\n- Seguy to Europe\n- Hennig to Liaoning\n\nWait, Hennig is linked to Liaoning in the distribution of Limnophora nigripes. So the relationship between Hennig and Liaoning is already there. \n\nBut in the previous output, the relationship between Hennig and Liaoning was missing. The text says \"分布国内：辽宁（本溪），黑龙江（哈尔滨，Hennig,1960)。\" So Hennig is cited in the distribution of Limnophora nigripes in Heilongjiang (Harbin). So the relationship between Hennig and Heilongjiang (Harbin) is already there. \n\nWait, the previous output had:\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENNIG<|>LIAONING<|>Henning is cited in the distribution of Limnophora nigripes in Liaoning<|>7)  \n\nBut the text says Hennig is cited in Heilongjiang for Limnophora nigripes. So the correct relationship is between Hennig and Heilongjiang. \n\nSo the previous output had a mistake here. The text says \"黑龙江（哈尔滨，Hennig,1960)\" which is Heilongjiang (Harbin, Hennig, 1960). So the relationship should be between Hennig and Heilongjiang. \n\nTherefore, the previous relationship between Hennig and Liaoning is incorrect. Need to correct that. \n\nSo the correct relationship is:\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENNIG<|>HEILONGJIANG<|>Henning is cited in the distribution of Limnophora nigripes in Heilongjiang<|>7)  \n##\n\nBut in the previous output, it was linked to Liaoning. That was a mistake. \n\nSo I need to correct that. \n\nAlso, the text mentions \"模式产地\" (type locality) for some species. For example, Limnophora tigrina tigrina has type locality in Taiwan. So the relationship between Am Stein and Taiwan is already there. \n\nAnother example: Limnophora himalayensis has type locality in India. So Brunetti is linked to India. \n\nLimnophora pandellei has type locality in Europe. So Seguy is linked to Europe. \n\nLimnophora orbitalis has type locality in Qinghai. So Seguy is linked to Qinghai. \n\nBut in the previous output, the relationship between Seguy and Qinghai was missing. The text says \"分布 国内：辽宁（本溪、建昌、兴城、锦县），河北（都山），山西（雁北），陕西(眉县），青海（模式产地）。” So the type locality is Qinghai. So the relationship between Seguy and Qinghai is:\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEGUIY<|>QINGHAI<|>Seguy is the author of Limnophora pandellei, a synonym for Limnophora orbitalis, which has Qinghai as its type locality<|>9)  \n##\n\nBut in the previous output, the relationship between Seguy and Qinghai was not present. \n\nSo adding that. \n\nAlso, the text mentions \"模式产地\" for Limnophora setinervoides as the Caucasus. So the author Ma is linked to the Caucasus. \n\nBut in the previous output, the relationship between Ma and Caucasus was missing. The text says \"分布国内：辽宁（建昌（模式产地）、本溪），河北，河南。” So the type locality is Liaoning (Jianchang). So the relationship between Ma and Jianchang (Liaoning) is:\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>MA<|>JIANCHANG<|>Ma is the author of Limnophora setinervoides, which has Jianchang in Liaoning as its type locality<|>9)  \n##\n\nBut Jianchang wasn't listed as a geo entity. So need to add Jianchang as a geo entity. \n\n(\"entity\"<|>JIANCHANG<|>GEO<|>Jianchang is a location in Liaoning province, China, where Limnophora setinervoides is found as its type locality.  \n##\n\nSimilarly, the text mentions \"模式产地为缅甸东北部\" for Limnophora apiciseta. So the relationship between Emden and Myanmar is already there. \n\nBut the text also mentions \"模式产地\" for other species. For example, Limnophora tigrina tigrina has type locality in Taiwan. So Am Stein is linked to Taiwan. \n\nLimnophora himalayensis has type locality in India. So Brunetti is linked to India. \n\nLimnophora pandellei has type locality in Europe. So Seguy is linked to Europe. \n\nLimnophora orbitalis has type locality in Qinghai. So Seguy is linked to Qinghai. \n\nLimnophora brunneisquama has type locality in Qinghai. So Mu and Chen are linked to Qinghai. \n\nSo the missing relationships are:\n\n- Seguy to Europe (for Limnophora pandellei)\n- Seguy to Qinghai (for Limnophora orbitalis)\n- Ma to Jianchang (for Limnophora setinervoides)\n- Am Stein to Thailand and Malaysia (for Limnophora tigrina tigrina)\n- Wiedemann to Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica\n\nAlso, the missing geo entities are Thailand, Malaysia, and Jianchang. \n\nSo the final entities to add are:\n\n- THAILAND (GEO)\n- MALAYSIA (GEO)\n- JIANCHANG (GEO)\n- HENNIG (PERSON) – but the text says Hennig is cited in Heilongjiang for Limnophora nigripes. So the person is Hennig, and the relationship is between Hennig and Heilongjiang. \n\nWait, the text says \"分布国内：辽宁（本溪），黑龙江（哈尔滨，Hennig,1960)。\" So Hennig is cited in Heilongjiang (Harbin) for Limnophora nigripes. So the person is Hennig, and the relationship is between Hennig and Heilongjiang. \n\nIn the previous output, the relationship was between Hennig and Liaoning, which is incorrect. So need to correct that. \n\nSo the correct relationship is:\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENNIG<|>HEILONGJIANG<|>Henning is cited in the distribution of Limnophora nigripes in Heilongjiang<|>7)  \n##\n\nAnd the entity Hennig is already present. \n\nSo the main missing entities are Thailand, Malaysia, and Jianchang. \n\nAdding those:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>THAILAND<|>GEO<|>Thailand is a country where certain species of flies are distributed.  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALAYSIA<|>GEO<|>Malaysia is a country where certain species of flies are distributed.  \n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIANCHANG<|>GEO<|>Jianchang is a location in Liaoning province, China, where Limnophora setinervoides is found as its type locality.  \n##\n\nAnd the relationships:\n\n- Seguy to Europe (for Limnophora pandellei)\n- Seguy to Qinghai (for Limnophora orbitalis)\n- Ma to Jianchang (for Limnophora setinervoides)\n- Am Stein to Thailand and Malaysia (for Limnophora tigrina tigrina)\n- Wiedemann to Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica\n\nSo the relationships to add are:\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEGUIY<|>EUROPE<|>Seguy is the author of Limnophora pandellei, a synonym for Limnophora orbitalis, which is distributed in Europe<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEGUIY<|>QINGHAI<|>Seguy is the author of Limnophora pandellei, a synonym for Limnophora orbitalis, which has Qinghai as its type locality<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MA<|>JIANCHANG<|>Ma is the author of Limnophora setinervoides, which has Jianchang in Liaoning as its type locality<|>9)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AM STEIN<|>THAILAND<|>Am Stein is the author of Limnophora tigrina tigrina, which is distributed in Thailand<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AM STEIN<|>MALAYSIA<|>Am Stein is the author of Limnophora tigrina tigrina, which is distributed in Malaysia<|>7)  \n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIEDEMANN<|>ACTA ZOOTAXONOMICA SINICA<|>Wiedemann's work is referenced in the journal Acta Zootaxonomica Sinica<|>6)  \n##\n\nAlso, the previous relationship between Hennig and Liaoning was incorrect.
