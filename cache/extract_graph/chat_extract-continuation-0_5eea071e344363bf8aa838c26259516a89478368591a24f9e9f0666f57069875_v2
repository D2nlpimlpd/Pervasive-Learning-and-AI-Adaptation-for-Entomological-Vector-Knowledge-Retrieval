The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. They want me to add the missing ones using the same format. The entity types are organization, person, geo, and event.\n\nFirst, I need to go back to the original text and check for any entities I might have overlooked. The text is in Chinese, so I have to be careful with the translation. The main content is about different species of flies and their descriptions, along with distribution and authors. \n\nLooking at the first part, there's a mention of \"Rec. Indian Mus., 26(3): 243, pl.14, fig.28(Sarcophga).\" Here, \"Rec. Indian Mus.\" is the Indian Museum's record. That's an organization. I didn't include that before. Also, \"Sarcophga\" is likely a typo for \"Sarcophaga,\" which is a genus. But since the user specified entity types, and \"Sarcophaga\" isn't listed as an event, person, or geo, maybe it's not an entity here. Wait, the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. So \"Sarcophaga\" might not fit unless it's part of a name. Hmm, maybe the figure reference is part of the publication, so \"Rec. Indian Mus.\" is the organization. \n\nThen, in the second part, \"Rec .Indian Mus., 26(3): 242, pl. 10, fig. 10(Sarcophaga).\" Again, \"Rec. Indian Mus.\" is the same organization. Also, \"Sarcophaga pilipleuris\" is a species name, but the author is Salem, 1945. I already included Salem as a person. \n\nLooking at the distribution for 球麻蝇属, it mentions \"东洋区，亚洲东部向北达于苏联远东.\" I included 东洋区 and 苏联远东 as geo entities. But maybe there are more specific locations. For example, \"模式产地\" (type locality) is mentioned as \"印度（马德拉斯省柯诺尔）\" which is India's Coimbatore in Madras state. I should extract \"马德拉斯省柯诺尔\" as a geo entity. \n\nAlso, the text has \"Sarcophaga pilipleuris Salem, 1945.\" Salem is already there, but maybe the journal or publication name \"Rec. Indian Mus.\" is an organization. I should check if that's a valid entity. \n\nIn the relationships, I connected the species to their authors and distribution areas. But there's a relationship between the species and the publication (Rec. Indian Mus.) where they were described. Also, the species might be part of the same genus, so maybe a relationship between the species and the genus. \n\nWait, the user's example 3 included multiple geo entities like capitals and prisons. In this case, the text mentions specific regions and cities in China, like 信阳地区 (Xinyang region) in Henan, and other cities like 南京, 扬州, 苏州 in Jiangsu. I should extract those as geo entities under their respective provinces. \n\nAlso, the authors mentioned are Senior-White, Rohdendorf, and Salem. I included them as persons, but maybe there are more authors in the references. For example, \"Sugiyama, Shinonaga et Kano, 1987\" in the distribution of 松毛虫缅麻蝇. Those are additional persons. \n\nThe text also mentions \"Sarcophaga pilipleuris Salem, 1945\" as a synonym for 盘突缅麻蝇. So there's a relationship between 盘突缅麻蝇 and Sarcophaga pilipleuris. \n\nI need to make sure all the geo entities are properly captured, including the specific regions and cities. Also, check if any other authors are mentioned in the references. \n\nLet me go through the text again. \n\nFor 松毛虫缅麻蝇, the distribution includes \"河南（信阳地区），安徽（赵建铭等1984), 江苏（南京、扬州、苏州），上海（松江佘山），浙江（莫干山），江西（南昌、弋阳、星子、武宁、乐平、庐山、九江），湖北（随县、麻城），湖南（溆浦），四川（重庆），福建（建阳），台湾（台南关仔岭），广东 （信宜大雾岭、潮安、南澳），广西（桂林雁山）.\" \n\nHere, \"赵建铭\" is a person in Anhui's record. I missed that. Also, \"Rec. Indian Mus.\" is the organization for the references. \n\nFor 盘突缅麻蝇, the distribution is \"河南（登封），湖北（应山），四川（峨眉山），台湾，云南（西双版纳（勐康））.\" \n\nThe foreign distribution includes \"越南，尼泊尔、印度（马德拉斯省柯诺尔（模式产地）），爪哇.\" \n\nIn the genus 球麻蝇属, the foreign distribution is \"越南，尼泊尔、印度（马德拉斯省柯诺尔（模式产地）），爪哇.\" \n\nSo, the missing geo entities are 信阳地区, 南京, 扬州, 苏州, 松江佘山, 莫干山, 南昌, 弋阳, 星子, 武宁, 乐平, 庐山, 九江, 随县, 麻城, 溆浦, 重庆, 建阳, 台南关仔岭, 信宜大雾岭, 潮安, 南澳, 桂林雁山, 登封, 应山, 峨眉山, 勐康, 马德拉斯省柯诺尔. \n\nAlso, the person 赵建铭 is mentioned in the Anhui distribution. \n\nRelationships: Each of these specific locations is part of the distribution for the respective species. Also, the authors of the references (Sugiyama, Shinonaga, Kano) should be linked to the species they are associated with. \n\nAdditionally, the synonymy between 盘突缅麻蝇 and Sarcophaga pilipleuris implies a relationship. \n\nI need to format all these entities and relationships correctly, using the specified types and ensuring the strength scores are appropriate.
