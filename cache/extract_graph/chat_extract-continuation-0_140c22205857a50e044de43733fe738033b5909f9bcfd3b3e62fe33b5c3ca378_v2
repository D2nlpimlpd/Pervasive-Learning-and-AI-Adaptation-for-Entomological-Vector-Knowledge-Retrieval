The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. They want me to add them using the same format. The entity types are organization, person, geo, and event. The text is about fly anatomy, specifically the abdomen and bristles.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the text again carefully. The previous output had two persons: 瞿 and Awati. But looking at the text, there are more mentions of people. For example, \"Awati (1917)\" and \"Qú (1956)\" are references, but maybe there are others. Wait, the text is in Chinese, so maybe the names are in Chinese. Let me check again.\n\nIn the part about the fifth sternite in females, it says \"后延部（瞿，1956), 即 Awati(1917)所谓的三角突(triangular process).\" So 瞿 and Awati are already there. Are there any other person names? The text also mentions \"家蝇属\" (Musca genus) and \"孟蝇属\" (Muscina genus), but those are organizations or maybe not. Wait, the entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The text is about anatomy, so maybe the genera are organizations? But in the examples, \"TechGlobal\" and \"Vision Holdings\" were organizations. However, in the context of biology, genera and species are taxonomic names, which might be considered organizations. But the user's examples didn't include that. Hmm, maybe I should stick to the examples given. The user's examples included \"Market Strategy Committee\" as an organization, so perhaps in this case, the genera like \"家蝇属\" (Musca) and \"孟蝇属\" (Muscina) are considered organizations. Let me check the text again.\n\nLooking at the text: \"在家蝇属中，侧叶不存在而往往具侧突；在孟蝇属中，有时无侧叶而具中叶(median piece);\" So \"家蝇属\" (Musca genus) and \"孟蝇属\" (Muscina genus) are biological terms. The entity types include organization, so maybe these are considered organizations. Similarly, \"芒蝇属Atherigona\" is another genus. So I should extract those as organizations.\n\nAlso, there are terms like \"有瓣蝇类\" (Schizophora), which is a suborder of flies. That might be an organization as well. Then, the text mentions \"雄性尾器\" (male terminalia) and \"雌性尾器\" (female terminalia), but those are parts, not entities. The user's examples included \"Central Institution\" as an organization, so maybe the genera and suborder are organizations here.\n\nNext, the relationships. The previous output had a relationship between 瞿 and Awati. But there are more relationships. For example, the genera Musca and Muscina are related to the fifth sternite structure. Also, the suborder Schizophora is related to the abdominal segments. The text mentions that in some groups, the fifth sternite in females is used for classification. So maybe each genus is related to the fifth sternite. Also, the terms like \"后腹部\" (postabdomen) and \"前腹部\" (preabdomen) are parts of the abdomen, but the user's examples included \"Firuzabad\" and \"Aurelia\" as geo entities. However, in this case, the text is about anatomy, so maybe those are not geo. Wait, the entity types are organization, person, geo, event. The text doesn't mention any events or places, so maybe the only entities are the people and the biological terms as organizations.\n\nSo, entities to add: Musca (家蝇属), Muscina (孟蝇属), Atherigona (芒蝇属), Schizophora (有瓣蝇类). Each of these is a genus or suborder, so they can be considered organizations. Then, relationships between these organizations and the anatomical structures they are associated with. For example, Musca is related to the fifth sternite having a posterior extension. Similarly, Muscina is related to having a median piece instead of lateral lobes. Atherigona is mentioned in the context of the seventh and eighth synsternite in males. Schizophora is the suborder that includes these flies, so it's related to the abdominal structure.\n\nAlso, the terms like \"第六腹节\" (6th abdominal segment), \"第七、八合腹节\" (7-8th synsternite), etc., are parts of the anatomy. But the user's examples didn't include these as entities. The user's examples had \"Central Institution\" as an organization, so maybe the anatomical parts are not entities here. The user's instruction says to only emit entities that match the previously extracted types. The previous extraction had person and organization, so I need to check if any other entities fit those types.\n\nAnother person mentioned is \"瞿\" (Qú) and \"Awati\". The text also mentions \"家蝇\" (housefly), but that's a species, not a person. So maybe no other persons. The main entities are the biological terms as organizations. Then, relationships between these organizations and the anatomical structures they are associated with. For example, Musca (家蝇属) is related to the fifth sternite's posterior extension. Similarly, Muscina (孟蝇属) is related to the median piece. Atherigona (芒蝇属) is related to the seventh and eighth synsternite in males. Schizophora (有瓣蝇类) is the suborder that includes these genera, so it's related to the abdominal structure.\n\nSo, the entities to add are the genera and suborder. The relationships would be each genus being associated with a specific anatomical feature. Also, the suborder Schizophora is related to the abdominal structure. The previous output had a relationship between 瞿 and Awati, but maybe there are more relationships between the genera and the anatomical parts. For example, Musca is related to the fifth sternite's posterior extension, Muscina to the median piece, Atherigona to the seventh and eighth synsternite. Also, the suborder Schizophora is related to the abdominal structure in general.\n\nI need to make sure that all these are captured. Let me list them out:\n\nEntities:\n- 家蝇属 (Musca) - organization\n- 孟蝇属 (Muscina) - organization\n- 芒蝇属 (Atherigona) - organization\n- 有瓣蝇类 (Schizophora) - organization\n\nRelationships:\n- Musca (家蝇属) is related to the fifth sternite's posterior extension (后延部)\n- Muscina (孟蝇属) is related to the fifth sternite's median piece (中叶)\n- Atherigona (芒蝇属) is related to the seventh and eighth synsternite in males\n- Schizophora (有瓣蝇类) is related to the abdominal structure (abdomen) in general\n\nAlso, the text mentions that the fifth sternite in females is sometimes used for classification in certain groups, so maybe each genus is related to the fifth sternite. The strength of these relationships would be high since they are directly mentioned. The previous relationship between 瞿 and Awati had a strength of 9, so maybe similar for these. But I need to check the text again for exact mentions.\n\nIn the text: \"在家蝇属中，侧叶不存在而往往具侧突；在孟蝇属中，有时无侧叶而具中叶(median piece); 在麻蝇族中，在基部后方正中常有膜状的窗(fenestella)。在某些类群的雌性中，第五腹板有时亦可供分类参考。在家蝇中，雌性第五腹板有时具向后延伸的略呈三角形的骨化部，称为后延部（瞿，1956), 即 Awati(1917)所谓的三角突(triangular process).\"\n\nSo, Musca (家蝇属) is associated with the posterior extension (后延部) in the fifth sternite. Muscina (孟蝇属) is associated with the median piece (中叶) in the fifth sternite. Atherigona (芒蝇属) is mentioned in the context of the seventh and eighth synsternite in males. Schizophora (有瓣蝇类) is the suborder that includes these genera, so it's related to the abdominal structure.\n\nTherefore, the relationships would be:\n\n- Musca (家蝇属) and 第五腹板 (fifth sternite) with a description about the posterior extension.\n- Muscina (孟蝇属) and 第五腹板 (fifth sternite) with a description about the median piece.\n- Atherigona (芒蝇属) and 第七、八合腹节 (7-8th synsternite) in males.\n- Schizophora (有瓣蝇类) and 腹部 (abdomen) as the suborder's structure.\n\nBut the user's examples didn't include anatomical parts as entities, so maybe I shouldn't add them. The user's instruction says to only emit entities that match the previously extracted types. The previous extraction had person and organization, so the biological terms like Musca, Muscina, etc., are considered organizations. The anatomical parts like fifth sternite are not entities here. So the relationships would be between the organizations (genera) and the anatomical features they are associated with, but the anatomical parts themselves are not entities. Wait, but in the previous example, \"Central Institution\" was an organization, and \"Market Strategy Committee\" was another. So in this case, the genera are organizations, and the anatomical features are parts of the structure, but not entities. So the relationships are between the genera and the specific anatomical features they have. The strength would be high because the text directly states these associations.\n\nSo, the entities to add are the genera and suborder. The relationships are each genus being associated with a specific anatomical feature. Also, the suborder Schizophora is related to the abdominal structure. The previous output had a relationship between 瞿 and Awati, but maybe there are more relationships between the genera and the anatomical parts.

实际上是前背鬃，在这两短毛列之后的实际上是后背鬃。其他的装备也常依其所在位置的表面来描述，可按此类推。\n(III)足鬃的鬃位\n按足的长轴将鬃的着生位置分为下列数种（图A20):\n基位(basal) 是指着生于最近心一端的鬃。\n亚基位 (sub-basal 或 pre-basal) 是指着生在很接近于基部的鬃。\n近中位(super-medial) 是指着生位置接近于中央但偏于基部的鬃。\n中位 (medial) 大体上着生在中央的鬃。\n亚中位(submedial) 是指着生位置接近于中央但偏于端部的鬃。\n近端位 (pre-apical 或 subapical) 是指着生位置很接近于端部的鬃。\n端位(apical) 是指着生于最远心一端的鬃。\n按足鬃的描述的习惯，在不指明鬃所在的纵轴上的位置的情况下，总是不包括端位鬃在内的。比如称“中足胫节前背鬃2\"'只表明在中足胫节的前背面上，除端位鬃以外 有两个鬃的意思。\nIX. 腹部 (abdomen)\n有瓣蝇类腹部在理论上由 11 节构成，节与节之间以节间膜 (intersegmental membrane)相连，但最末几节常不发达或退化，形成所谓负肛节(proctiger) [图A22,A24 (10)]。 这样不包括负肛节在内，在雄性中主要由9节构成，而在雌性中主要由8节构成。两性的腹部第一至五各腹节合称为前腹部［图A22-A23],亦即外观明显可见的各节。第六腹节以后各节合称后腹部(post-abdomen), 这在雄性中主要形成雄性尾器(male terminalia) , 在雌性中形成雌性尾器(female terminalia), 也就是所谓产卵器(female egg-laying apparatus, 或oviscapt)。 各腹节都由宽大的背板(tergite)和较狭小的腹板 (sternite)构成，在背板侧缘与腹板侧缘之间则为膜状部分，称为腹面膜(ventral membrane) [图A22-A23(31)]。通常自第一腹节至第七腹节原则上每节各具一对气门。在有瓣蝇类中；气门通常着生在背板近侧缘处。\n（I）前腹部（preabdomen）(图A22-A23)\ni) 背板(tergites) 外观一般为4个。即第一、二合背板(1st and 2nd syntergite), 第三背板，第四背板，第五背板；第一、二合背板在近腹缘常具2对气门(spiracles) 而第三、四、五各背板的近腹缘各有1对气门。背板上的鬃按着生部位分为：\n心鬃(discal bristles) 指位于背板背面的缘鬃与背片前缘之间的鬃。其中紧位于背方正中线旁的1对鬃称为中心鬃(median discal bristles)。在中心鬃的两侧的心鬃称为背侧心鬃(dorsolateral discal bristles)。\n侧鬃(lateral bristles) 指位于背板侧面，也就是心鬃两侧的鬃。\n缘鬃(marginal bristles) 指位于沿背板后缘的鬃，其中紧位于背方正中线旁的1对鬃称为中缘鬃 (median marginal bristles)。 其余的缘鬃称为侧缘鬃 (lateral marginal bristles)。\nii)腹板(sternites) 外观一般为5个，即第一腹板、第二腹板、第三腹板、第四腹板和第五腹板。第五腹板在两性中显著异形。在雄性中第五腹板常被用作为分类特征之一；它的形态一般由前方的基部(base)和后方的侧叶(arm , late-ral lobe)构成，各科各属型式各异；例如在家蝇属中，侧叶不存在而往往具侧突；在孟蝇属中，有时无侧叶而具中叶(median piece); 在麻蝇族中，在基部后方正中常有膜状的窗(fenestella)。在某些类群的雌性中，第五腹板有时亦可供分类参考。在家蝇中，雌性第五腹板有时具向后延伸的略呈三角形的骨化部，称为后延部（瞿，1956), 即 Awati(1917)所谓的三角突(triangular process)。\n（II)后腹部(postabdomen) (图 A23-A24 , A29) \n主要形成尾器(terminalia)。\n雄性\n(i)第六腹节(6th abdominal segment) 如不把后腹部完全拉出则不易看到。通常由狭小的第六背板(6th tergite) [图A24(6)]和狭长如弓形的第六腹板(6th sternite) ［图A24(16 上）］组成，后者常隐于第五腹板内方，形成了生殖兜(genital pouch) [图A24 (16下）］的边框。 第六腹节气门［图A24(24)］位于膜上。 在有些类群中第六背板退化。\n(ii)第七、八合腹节(7-8th synsternite) [图A24(7-8)] 又名雄生殖前节(prot­andrium)。系由第七、第八两腹节愈合而成，腹板退化或与背板愈着不再能区分，因此左右常不对称。第七、八两节的愈合有时略留痕迹，在原第七背板上具1对气门［图A24 （25) ], 以后各节都无气门。在蝇总科的某些类群中第七腹节的气门缺如。在某些种类（如芒蝇属Atherigona)的雄性中，第七、八合腹节的背\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n\n(\"entity\"<|>瞿<|>PERSON<|>Qú is a person
