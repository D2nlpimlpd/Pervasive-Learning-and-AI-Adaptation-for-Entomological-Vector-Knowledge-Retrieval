The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. I need to go back and check the original text again to make sure I didn't overlook anything. The entity types are organization, person, geo, and event. \n\nFirst, looking at the text again. The first part mentions \"美洲\" which is \"America\" in Chinese. I already included that as a geo entity. Then there are species like Hebecnema alba and Hebecnema affinis. I think I captured those as organization entities, but maybe there are more. The text also lists several genera and tribes, like Heliographa, Limnophora, Pseudolimnophora, Neolimnophora, Spilogona, and Graphomya. I included those, but perhaps there are more.\n\nWait, in the text, there's a part about the \"模式产地\" (type locality) for Hebecnema alba being Benxi in Liaoning. I have that. For Hebecnema affinis, the text says it's distributed in Jilin (Tonghua), Europe, and North America. I included those. \n\nLooking at the authors and describers: Hsue, Malloch, Schnabl et Dziedzicki, Schnabl, and Robineau-Desvoidy. I have Hsue, Malloch, Schnabl et Dziedzicki, and Schnabl. But Robineau-Desvoidy is mentioned for Limnophora, so I should add that as a person entity. \n\nAlso, the text mentions \"昆虫学报\" which is the Entomological Journal. I included that as an organization. But there's a reference to \"Deutsch, Ent.Zeitschr,, 1911: 92(Limnophora subg.)\" which is another publication, maybe \"Ent.Zeitschr\" as a journal. I should check if that's a valid entity. Since it's a journal, it would be an organization. \n\nNext, the relationships. The original output had some relationships between the species and their authors, but maybe there are more. For example, the text says \"模式种 Aricia carbonella Zetterstedt, 1845.\" So Zetterstedt is the author of the type species for Spilogona. I should add Zetterstedt as a person and link him to Spilogona. \n\nAlso, the text mentions \"属征 ♂额一般狭于♀额...\" which is the genus characteristics for Spilogona. The authors here are Schnabl, 1911. I already have Schnabl as a person for Spilogona, but maybe the relationship between the genus and the journal where it was published. \n\nLooking at the other genera: Heliographa is described by Malloch, 1921. I have Malloch linked to Hebecnema affinis, but Heliographa is another genus. So I need to add Heliographa as an organization and link Malloch to it. \n\nSimilarly, Limnophora is described by Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830. I should add Robineau-Desvoidy as a person and link him to Limnophora. \n\nPseudolimnophora is described by Strobl, 1893. I have Strobl in the original text as part of the Pseudolimnophora entry, but in the initial extraction, I only included the genus. So I need to add Strobl as a person and link him to Pseudolimnophora. \n\nNeolimnophora is described by Schnabl et Dziedzicki, 1911. I have Schnabl et Dziedzicki linked to Graphomya, but Neolimnophora is another genus. So add Neolimnophora as an organization and link Schnabl et Dziedzicki to it. \n\nSpilogona is described by Schnabl, 1911. I have Schnabl linked to Spilogona, but the text also mentions \"Deutsch, Ent.Zeitschr,, 1911: 92(Limnophora subg.)\" which is a publication. So maybe add Ent.Zeitschr as an organization and link it to Spilogona. \n\nAlso, the text has a part about the tribe Limnophorini being partially included in the subfamily Coenosiinae. I have Limnophorini as an organization, but maybe the relationship between Limnophorini and Coenosiinae should be adjusted. Wait, in the initial extraction, I had a relationship between Coenosiina and Limnophorini, but the text says \"池蝇族Limnophorini (部分）\" under the subfamily Coenosiinae. So the relationship is that Limnophorini is part of Coenosiinae. I should check if that's already included. Yes, in the original output, there's a relationship between Coenosiina and Limnophorini. \n\nNow, looking for other relationships. The text has several genera under Limnophorini, like Heliographa, Limnophora, Pseudolimnophora, Neolimnophora, Spilogona, and Graphomya. Each of these should have a relationship to Limnophorini as being part of the tribe. \n\nAlso, the species Hebecnema alba and Hebecnema affinis are part of the subfamily Coenosiinae. So relationships between those species and Coenosiina. \n\nAdditionally, the text mentions \"昆虫学报，26 (2): 226-227, 图1-3。\" which is the Entomological Journal, 26(2):226-227. So the species Hebecnema alba and Hebecnema affinis were published in this journal. I have that for Hebecnema alba and affinis, but maybe the journal itself has more relationships. \n\nWait, the user wants to add missed entities and relationships. Let me go through the text again step by step. \n\nIn the first part, the species are listed with their authors and years. Each of these authors should be a person entity. For example, Robineau-Desvoidy for Limnophora, Strobl for Pseudolimnophora, Schnabl for Spilogona, and Dziedzicki for Neolimnophora. \n\nThen, the genera and tribes. Each genus is part of a tribe. For example, Heliographa is under Limnophorini, Limnophora is under Limnophorini, etc. So each genus should have a relationship to Limnophorini. \n\nAlso, the subfamily Coenosiinae includes tribes like Lispini and Coenosiini. The species Hebecnema alba and affinis are part of Coenosiinae. So relationships between each species and Coenosiina. \n\nThe text also has a part about the type species for Spilogona being Aricia carbonella by Zetterstedt, 1845. So Zetterstedt is a person, and the relationship is that he described the type species for Spilogona. \n\nI think I missed some authors and their corresponding genera or species. Let me list all the authors mentioned:\n\n- Hsue, 1983 (Hebecnema alba)\n- Malloch, 1921 (Hebecnema affinis)\n- Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 (Limnophora)\n- Strobl, 1893 (Pseudolimnophora)\n- Schnabl et Dziedzicki, 1911 (Neolimnophora and Graphomya)\n- Schnabl, 1911 (Spilogona)\n- Zetterstedt, 1845 (Aricia carbonella, type species for Spilogona)\n\nSo I need to add Robineau-Desvoidy, Strobl, and Zetterstedt as person entities. \n\nAlso, the journal \"昆虫学报\" (Entomological Journal) is mentioned for Hebecnema alba and affinis. The other journal is \"Ent.Zeitschr\" (Entomologische Zeitschrift) for Spilogona. \n\nNow, the relationships between the authors and the genera/species they described. For example, Robineau-Desvoidy described Limnophora, Strobl described Pseudolimnophora, Zetterstedt described Aricia carbonella (type species for Spilogona). \n\nAdditionally, the genera are part of the tribe Limnophorini, so each genus should have a relationship to Limnophorini. \n\nThe species are part of the subfamily Coenosiinae, so each species should have a relationship to Coenosiina. \n\nI also need to check if all the genera and tribes are correctly captured. The text lists several under Limnophorini, so each of those should be an organization entity. \n\nLet me make sure I didn't miss any. The text has:\n\n- Heliographa Malloch, 1921\n- Limnophora Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830\n- Pseudolimnophora Strobl, 1893\n- Neolimnophora Schnabl et Dziedzicki, 1911\n- Spilogona Schnabl, 1911\n- Graphomya Schnabl et Dziedzicki, 1911\n\nSo all these genera are part of Limnophorini. \n\nAlso, the text mentions \"Deutsch, Ent.Zeitschr,, 1911: 92(Limnophora subg.)\" which is a publication by Deutsch in Ent.Zeitschr. So Ent.Zeitschr is another journal (organization) and Deutsch is a person. \n\nWait, the user said to only emit entities that match the previously extracted types. The initial extraction had \"ENTOMOLOGICAL JOURNAL\" as an organization. But \"Ent.Zeitschr\" is another journal. So I should add that as an organization entity. \n\nSimilarly, the authors like Robineau-Desvoidy, Strobl, Zetterstedt, and Deutsch need to be added as person entities. \n\nSo the missed entities are:\n\n- ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY (PERSON)\n- STROBL (PERSON)\n- ZETTERSTEDT (PERSON)\n- DEUTSCH (PERSON)\n- ENT.ZEITSCHR (ORGANIZATION)\n\nAnd the relationships between these authors and the genera/species they described, as well as the genera being part of Limnophorini and the species part of Coenosiinae. \n\nAlso, the type species for Spilogona is Aricia carbonella by Zetterstedt, so a relationship between Zetterstedt and Spilogona. \n\nI need to make sure all these are included in the output.
