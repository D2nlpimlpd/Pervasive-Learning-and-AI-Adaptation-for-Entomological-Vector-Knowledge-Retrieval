The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. They want me to add them using the same format. First, I need to go back to the original text and check if there are any other entities that fit the types: organization, person, geo, event.\n\nLooking at the text again, there are several species of flies listed with their descriptions and distributions. Each entry has a species name, author, year, and references to journals. The previous extraction included some of these, but maybe I missed others. For example, the 1397卡西亚麻蝇 entry has \"Rec.Ind.Mus.\" as the journal, which was included, but maybe there are more entries after that. Wait, the text cuts off at \"Rec.Ind.Mus.,26:\" so there might be more, but since it's incomplete, perhaps I should only consider what's provided.\n\nAlso, the 1395巨亚麻蝇 entry mentions \"Sarcophaga koreaensis Park et Kano, 1961.\" Here, Park and Kano are authors, so they should be extracted as persons. The previous output didn't include them. Similarly, in the 1393义乌亚麻蝇 entry, there's \"Sarcophaga pingiana Hsieh, 1958.\" Hsieh is another person who should be added.\n\nLooking at the geo entities, the 1394叉形亚麻蝇 has \"Sri Lanka\" as the type locality, which was included. The 1395巨亚麻蝇 lists \"North Korea\" as a distribution, which was there. The 1396犁头亚麻蝇 includes \"Inner Mongolia,\" \"Italy,\" \"France,\" \"Spain,\" \"Austria,\" \"Hungary,\" \"Yugoslavia,\" and \"Soviet Union.\" The previous extraction had some of these, but maybe \"Yugoslavia\" and \"Soviet Union\" were missed. Wait, in the previous output, \"Yugoslavia\" and \"Soviet Union\" were included for 1396犁头亚麻蝇, so maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the previous output, for 1396犁头亚麻蝇, the geo entities listed are Inner Mongolia, Italy, France, Spain, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Soviet Union. So all of those were included. But the user says some were missed. Maybe I need to check if there are other geo entities in the text. For example, in the 1393义乌亚麻蝇, the distribution includes \"辽宁，河南，江苏，湖北，浙江，四川（重庆歌乐山（模式产地））\" which translates to Liaoning, Henan, Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, Sichuan (Chongqing Geleshan, type locality). The previous extraction had Liaoning, Henan, Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and North Korea. But the type locality for 1395巨亚麻蝇 is Chongqing Geleshan in Sichuan. So maybe \"Chongqing Geleshan\" should be a geo entity under Sichuan? Or is it part of the description? The user might expect that as a separate geo entity. However, the original text lists it as part of the distribution, so perhaps it's considered a location within Sichuan. But in the previous output, Sichuan was already listed as a province. Maybe the user wants more specific locations like Chongqing Geleshan as a separate geo entity. But the example given in the problem didn't split provinces into cities, so maybe it's better to keep it as Sichuan. Hmm, but the user might have missed that. Let me check the original text again.\n\nIn the 1395巨亚麻蝇 distribution: \"辽宁，河南，江苏，湖北，浙江，四川（重庆歌乐山（模式产地））\" – the part in parentheses is the type locality. So \"Chongqing Geleshan\" is a specific location in Sichuan. Since the user's previous extraction included Sichuan as a geo entity, but not the specific location, maybe that's a missed entity. However, the example in the problem didn't split cities from provinces, so perhaps it's better to treat it as part of the description. But the user might want it as a separate geo entity. I need to decide based on the examples. In Example 3, cities like Krohaara and Cashion were extracted as separate geo entities. So maybe in this case, \"Chongqing Geleshan\" should be a separate geo entity. But the user's previous output didn't include it. So I should add it.\n\nAlso, the 1396犁头亚麻蝇 has \"模式产地\" (type locality) as France. The previous extraction included France as a geo entity, but maybe the type locality is a specific location in France. However, the text just says \"模式产地\" without a specific city, so perhaps it's just France. The user might have missed that, but in the example, when the type locality is mentioned, it's added as a separate geo entity if specified. Since here it's just France, maybe it's okay as is.\n\nAnother thing: the 1393义乌亚麻蝇 has \"模式产地\" (type locality) as Zhejiang. The previous extraction included Zhejiang as a geo entity. So that's correct.\n\nNow, looking for other entities. The text mentions \"Sarcophaga pingiana Hsieh, 1958\" and \"Sarcophaga koreaensis Park et Kano, 1961.\" These are species names, but the user's entity types are organization, person, geo, event. So \"Sarcophaga pingiana\" and \"Sarcophaga koreaensis\" are organizations (species), and Hsieh, Park, Kano are persons. The previous extraction didn't include these. So I need to add them.\n\nFor example, \"Sarcophaga pingiana\" is an organization, and Hsieh is the person who described it in 1958. Similarly, \"Sarcophaga koreaensis\" is an organization, and Park and Kano are the authors. So these should be added as entities.\n\nAlso, the 1397卡西亚麻蝇 entry has \"Rec.Ind.Mus.,26:\" but the previous extraction included \"Rec.Ind.Mus.\" as an organization. The user might have missed the page number or other details, but the main entity is the journal.\n\nNow, checking the relationships. The previous extraction had relationships between the species and their authors, and between species and journals. But for the new entities like Sarcophaga pingiana and Sarcophaga koreaensis, their relationships with Hsieh, Park, Kano, and the respective journals should be added.\n\nFor example, Sarcophaga pingiana was described by Hsieh in 1958 and published in Bull.Fan Mem.Inst.Biol., ZooL. Similarly, Sarcophaga koreaensis was described by Park and Kano in 1961 and published in some journal. Wait, the text for Sarcophaga koreaensis is \"Sarcophaga koreaensis Park et Kano, 1961.\" The journal isn't mentioned here, but in the 1395巨亚麻蝇 entry, the journal is \"Proc.Roy.Ent.Soc.London.\" So maybe Sarcophaga koreaensis is part of that journal? The text for 1395巨亚麻蝇 includes \"Proc,Roy.Ent,Soc,London, (B)18(9-10): 166-170, figs.3-5(Sarcophaga).\" So the journal is Proc.Roy.Ent.Soc.London. Therefore, Sarcophaga koreaensis is published in that journal. So the relationship between Sarcophaga koreaensis and Proc.Roy.Ent.Soc.London should be added.\n\nSimilarly, Sarcophaga pingiana is mentioned in the 1393义乌亚麻蝇 entry as \"Sarcophaga pingiana Hsieh, 1958.\" The journal here is \"Bull.Fan Mem.Inst.Biol., ZooL.\" So the relationship between Sarcophaga pingiana and that journal should be added.\n\nAlso, the relationships between the authors (Hsieh, Park, Kano) and the species they described. For example, Hsieh described Sarcophaga pingiana, so a relationship between Hsieh and Sarcophaga pingiana with strength 9.\n\nAdditionally, the 1395巨亚麻蝇 entry mentions \"Proc,Roy.Ent,Soc,London\" as the journal, so the relationship between 1395巨亚麻蝇 and that journal was already included. But Sarcophaga koreaensis is another species in the same journal, so that's a new relationship.\n\nSo, the missed entities are:\n\n- Sarcophaga pingiana (ORGANIZATION)\n- Hsieh (PERSON)\n- Sarcophaga koreaensis (ORGANIZATION)\n- Park (PERSON)\n- Kano (PERSON)\n- Proc.Roy.Ent.Soc.London (ORGANIZATION) – already included for 1395巨亚麻蝇, but need to check if Sarcophaga koreaensis is also related to it.\n\nWait, the 1395巨亚麻蝇 entry includes \"Proc,Roy.Ent,Soc,London\" as the journal, and Sarcophaga koreaensis is part of that entry. So the relationship between Sarcophaga koreaensis and Proc.Roy.Ent.Soc.London should be added.\n\nAlso, the 1393义乌亚麻蝇 entry has \"Sarcophaga pingiana Hsieh, 1958.\" So the journal is \"Bull.Fan Mem.Inst.Biol., ZooL.\" So the relationship between Sarcophaga pingiana and that journal is needed.\n\nSo, adding these entities and their relationships.
