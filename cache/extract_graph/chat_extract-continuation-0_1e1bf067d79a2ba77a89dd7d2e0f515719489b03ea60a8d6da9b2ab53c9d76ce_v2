The user mentioned that many entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction. They want me to add the missing ones using the same format. The entity types are organization, person, geo, and event. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the provided text again to make sure I didn't overlook any entities. The text is in Chinese, so I have to be careful with the translation. The main entities already extracted were the genera Chionomyia and Paregle, the species Anthomyza vetula, and various people and places. \n\nLooking at the text, there's a mention of \"Musca audacula Harris, 1780\" as the type species for Paregle. Harris is already listed as a person, but Musca audacula is a species, which would be an organization. Wait, in the previous output, Paregle's type species was listed as Musca radicum, which is the same as Musca audacula. So maybe \"Musca audacula\" should be an entity under organization. But the user said to only use the previously extracted types. The existing entities under organization are Chionomyia, Anthomyza vetula, and Paregle. So \"Musca audacula\" is another organization entity.\n\nAlso, in the distribution section for Chionomyia vetula, there's \"内蒙古（呼和浩特）\" which is Inner Mongolia (Hohhot). Hohhot is a city in Inner Mongolia, so that's a geo entity. The user might have missed Hohhot in the previous extraction.\n\nIn the relationships, the connection between Paregle and Musca audacula Harris should be added. Also, the relationship between Chionomyia and Musca audacula as the type species might be missing. Additionally, the text mentions that Schnabl and Dziedzicki (1911) grouped Chionomyia and Paregle, so the relationship between Schnabl and Dziedzicki as co-authors should be included. \n\nAnother point is the mention of \"前中侧片鬃\" in the description of Paregle. This is a morphological feature, but since it's part of the entity description, maybe it's already covered. However, the user might want to ensure all related entities are linked. \n\nAlso, the text refers to \"Musca radicum\" as the type species for Paregle, which is the same as \"Musca audacula Harris\". So \"Musca radicum\" is another organization entity, and Harris is a person. The relationship between Paregle and Musca radicum should be added. \n\nI should check if all the people mentioned are included. The previous output had Schnabl, Dziedzicki, Harris, Hennig, Kato, Suwa, and Xue Wanqi. The text also mentions \"Schnabl et Dziedzicki (1911)\", so the relationship between Schnabl and Dziedzicki as co-authors is important. \n\nFor the geo entities, the user might have missed Hohhot. Also, the distribution in Europe includes Lapland, which is already there. \n\nIn the relationships, the user might have missed the link between Chionomyia and Musca audacula as the type species. Also, the fact that Musca audacula is the same as Musca radicum should be noted. \n\nI need to make sure all these are added without introducing new entity types.
