His work spanned multiple genera and families, with notable descriptions of species across various years. In **1817**, he described *Thricops semicinereus*. By **1819**, Wiedemann had documented *Gonia bimaculata* and *Bengalia (Anisomyia) torosa* (侧线孟蝇), the latter being a Chinese species. In **1820**, he named *Stomorhina xanthogaster*. His 1824 publications included *Brontaea tonitrui*, *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, *Gonia chinensis*, and *Limnophora exigua*, the latter of which he also described as the original author.  \n\nWiedemann’s most prolific period appears to have been **1830**, during which he described numerous species. These include *Stomorhina obsoleta* and *Stomorhina melastoma*, *Pseudogonia rufifrons*, *Musca lauta* (later reclassified as *Neomyia (Scutellorthellia) lauta*), *Lispe orientalis* and *Lispe leucospila*, *Musca cornicina*, *Myospila bina*, *Musca ventrosa* and *Musca planiceps*, *Musca chalybea*, *Exorista sorbillans*, *Oestrus maculatus* (now *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina*), and *Dichaetomyia bibax*. Additionally, he was associated with the mode species of *Craspedochoeta* and *Sisyropa thermophila*.  \n\nEarlier in his career, Wiedemann also described *Isomyia viridaurea* and *Ophyra leucostoma* and *Ophyra chalcogaster*, the latter two being linked to his work on blowflies. His 1824 contributions extended to *Hydrophoria conica*, though the exact year for this species is unspecified in some sources. In 1830, he further expanded his taxonomic work by documenting six *Atherigona* species, including 611扁蹠芒蝇 and 612黄髭芒蝇, though the full scientific names for these remain in Chinese.  \n\nWiedemann’s legacy includes resolving nomenclatural complexities, such as the reclassification of *Musca lauta* into *Neomyia lauta* and *Oestrus maculatus* into *Lucilia cuprina*. He also served as the collector of the *Sarcophaga haematodes* specimen, highlighting his role in specimen curation. Despite some inconsistencies in the data—such as conflicting years for *Morellia hortensia* (1824 vs. 1830) and *Hydrophoria conica*—his work remains foundational in entomology, particularly for dipteran taxonomy. His descriptions of species like *Lispe orientalis* and *Lispe leucospila* (1830), *Gonia chinensis* (1824), and *Stomorhina xanthogaster* (1820) underscore his meticulous approach to documenting biodiversity.  \n\nOverall, Wiedemann’s career reflects a dedication to systematic entomology, with his 1830 publications being especially influential. His efforts in naming and reclassifying species, alongside his role in collecting specimens, solidified his reputation as a key figure in 19th-century insect taxonomy. The contradictions in the data, such as the dual years for *Morellia hortensia*, may stem from overlapping descriptions or subsequent taxonomic revisions, but his primary contributions remain well-documented and widely recognized.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about WIEDEMANN. First, I need to go through all the descriptions and note the key points. \n\nStarting with the entities, it's just \"WIEDEMANN\", so the summary should focus on that person. The descriptions mention various species he described, along with the years. I see some species listed with different years, like 1817, 1819, 1820, 1824, and 1830. I need to organize these by year to make it clear when each was described.\n\nSome entries are in Chinese, like \"611扁蹠芒蝇\" and \"612黄髭芒蝇\". I should check if those are the same as the Latin names mentioned elsewhere. For example, \"侧线孟蝇\" is translated as Bengalia (Anisomyia) torosa, which is in 1819. I need to include the Chinese names but also their Latin equivalents for clarity.\n\nThere are a few contradictions. For instance, \"Author of Hydrophoria conica\" doesn't have a year, but others have 1824 or 1830. I should note that unless a specific year is given, it's just mentioned as an author. Also, some species are listed multiple times, like Lispe orientalis and Lispe leucospila. I need to combine those mentions to avoid repetition.\n\nI need to make sure all the species are included. Let me list them out: Stomorhina obsoleta and melastoma (1830), Pseudogonia rufifrons (1830), Atherigona species 611 and 612, Brontaea tonitrui (1824), Dichaetomyia quadrata (1824), Hydrophoria conica, Craspedochoeta mode species (1830), Musca lauta (1830, reclassified as Neomyia lauta), Isomyia viridaurea, Lispe orientalis and leucospila (1830), Musca cornicina, Myospila bina (1830), Musca ventrosa and planiceps, Ophyra leucostoma and chalcogaster, Limnophora exigua (1824), Sisyropa thermophila, Rhinia apicalis (1830), Stomorhina xanthogaster (1820), Thricops semicinereus (1817), Musca chalybea (1830), Exorista sorbillans (1830), Oestrus maculatus (1830), Dichaetomyia bibax (1830), Gonia chinensis (1824) and bimaculata (1819), and Bengalia (Anisomyia) torosa (1819). \n\nI should group the species by the years they were described. Also, note that some species were reclassified, like Musca lauta to Neomyia lauta. The user mentioned resolving contradictions, so if there's a discrepancy in the year, I need to check which one is correct. For example, Morellia hortensia is listed as 1830 and 1824. The data says \"in 1830\" and \"in 1824\", so I need to include both unless there's a conflict. Wait, one says 1830 and another 1824. That's a contradiction. I should check if both are correct. If the data includes both, maybe he described it in both years? Or perhaps it's a mistake. Since the user wants contradictions resolved, I need to clarify. But the data might have errors. Let me see: \"Scientist who described the species Morellia hortensia in 1830\" and \"Wiedemann is the person who described the species Morellia hortensia in 1824\". Hmm, that's conflicting. I need to check if there's a way to reconcile. Maybe the species was described in 1824 and then another in 1830? Or perhaps it's the same species with different years. Since the user says to resolve contradictions, I'll have to pick one. But without more info, maybe I can mention both years if they are different species. Wait, the same species can't be described in two different years by the same person. So perhaps it's a mistake in the data. I'll have to note that Morellia hortensia was described in 1824 and 1830, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe one is a typo. Let me check the original data again. The first one says 1830, the second 1824. Since the user wants a coherent summary, I'll have to state that he described Morellia hortensia in 1824 and 1830, but that might be an error. However, since the data is provided as is, I should include both unless I can confirm. Maybe it's two different species with the same name? Unlikely. So perhaps the correct approach is to list both years but note the discrepancy. But the user wants a single coherent summary. Maybe the 1830 entry is a reclassification or a different species. Alternatively, maybe the 1824 is correct. I'll have to include both and mention the years, but perhaps the 1830 is a later description. Wait, the data says \"in 1830\" and \"in 1824\". So I need to present both unless there's a way to resolve. Since I can't verify, I'll list both years but clarify that the data might have conflicting information. However, the user might prefer to just list all the years as per the data. Let me proceed to list all the years as given, even if there's a conflict, but in the summary, I can mention the years when possible.\n\nAlso, the user wants the summary in third person and include entity names. So I should start with \"Wiedemann was a German entomologist...\" and then list all the species with their years. Need to make sure the names are correctly formatted, using italics for species and proper binomial nomenclature. \n\nI should also check for any other contradictions. For example, \"Describer of *Musca ventrosa* and *Musca planiceps*\" and \"Describer of *Musca chalybea* in 1830\". All these are under the same entity, so they should be grouped. \n\nNow, compiling all the information. Start with the profession: entomologist, taxonomist, scientist. Then list the species by year. Make sure to mention reclassifications, like Musca lauta to Neomyia lauta. Also, note the collector of Sarcophaga haematodes. \n\nI need to structure the summary in a logical order, perhaps chronological. Start with the earliest year mentioned, 1817, then 1819, 1820, 1824, and 1830. Group the species under each year. Also, mention the collector role for Sarcophaga haematodes. \n\nCheck for any duplicate entries. For example, Lispe orientalis is mentioned twice in 1830. Combine those. Similarly, Gonia chinensis is mentioned in 1824 and as a describer. \n\nFinally, ensure the summary is under 500 words. Let me count the words as I go. Need to be concise but comprehensive. Avoid redundancy. Use terms like \"notable works include\" or \"described species such as\". \n\nPutting it all together: Start with the profession and time period. Then list the species by year, including reclassifications. Mention the collector role. Conclude with his contributions to entomology. Make sure all entity names are included and the summary is coherent.\n"}}], "created": 1754034810, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2590, "prompt_tokens": 894, "total_tokens": 3484, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 1744, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
