It is distinguished by the absence of dark fringes on its wing cross-veins, a key morphological characteristic that aids in its identification. The holotype locality for this species is recorded as Liaoning, a region in northeastern China known for its rich fossil deposits and significant contributions to paleontological research. As a newly described species at the time of its publication, *Phanioa recta* represents an addition to the taxonomic understanding of flies, particularly within the context of fossil records or entomological studies in the Liaoning area. The work of Hsue in 1984 provided foundational taxonomic details, establishing the species' classification and geographic origin. No contradictory information is present in the provided descriptions, and the summary integrates all relevant details into a cohesive account.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a summary of the data provided for the entity \"PHANOIA RECTA\". The entities are a species of fly, and there are two descriptions. First, I need to make sure I understand both descriptions correctly.\n\nThe first description says it's a species described by Hsue, with wing cross-veins without dark fringes and a holotype locality in Liaoning. The second one mentions it's a new species described by Hsue in 1984. So, the key points here are the name, the describer (Hsue), the year (1984), the wing cross-veins feature, and the holotype location.\n\nI need to combine these into a single, coherent summary. The user emphasized third person and including entity names for context. Also, if there are contradictions, I should resolve them. Let me check if there's any conflict. Both descriptions agree on Hsue being the describer and the year 1984. The first one adds specific morphological details and the holotype locality. The second just reiterates the new species and the year. No contradictions here, so I can merge the information.\n\nNow, structure the summary. Start with the full name, then the describer and year. Mention the key characteristics: wing cross-veins without dark fringes. Then the holotype locality in Liaoning. Make sure to keep it concise, under 500 words. Also, use third person and ensure all entity names are included. Let me verify the details again. Hsue described it in 1984, the species is Phanioa recta, the features are the wing cross-veins, and the holotype is from Liaoning. That's all. I think that's it. Just need to present it clearly and combine the two descriptions without redundancy.\n"}}], "created": 1754105307, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 577, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 767, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 392, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
