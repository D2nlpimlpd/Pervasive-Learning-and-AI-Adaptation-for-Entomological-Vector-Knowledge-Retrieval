As a newly identified species at the time of its description, *Phanioa benxiensis* contributes to the understanding of fly biodiversity in the region.

The user wants a summary of the data provided for the entity \"PHANOIA BENXIENSIS\". The entities are a species of fly, and there are two descriptions. First, I need to check if there's any contradiction between them.\n\nThe first description says it's a species described by Xue and Yu with the holotype locality in Benxi, Liaoning. The second one mentions it's a new species described by the same authors in 1986. The key points here are the authors, the year, and the holotype location. Both agree on the authors, but the second adds the year 1986. The first doesn't specify the year, so I should include the year from the second description to make the summary more complete. The holotype locality is in Benxi, Liaoning, which is a specific location, so that's important to note.\n\nI need to combine these into a single, coherent summary. Start by stating the full name, then the authors and year. Mention that it's a new species, and include the holotype locality. Make sure it's in third person and within 500 words. Since there's no contradiction, just merge the information. Check if there's any missing data, but the given descriptions don't have more details. Alright, that should cover it.\n"}}], "created": 1754105308, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 424, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 609, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 280, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
