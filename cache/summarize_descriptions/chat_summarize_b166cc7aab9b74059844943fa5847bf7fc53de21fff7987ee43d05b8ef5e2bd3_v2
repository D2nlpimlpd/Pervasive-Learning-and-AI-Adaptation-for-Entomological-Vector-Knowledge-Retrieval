Active primarily in the 1830s and 1860s, he described numerous genera and species, many of which remain foundational in modern entomology. In 1830, he established or described key genera such as *Aplomyia*, *Adia*, *Spallanzania*, *Mydaea*, *Myospila*, *Egenia*, *Hydrotaea*, *Nemoraea*, *Caricea*, *Limosia*, *Agria*, *Carcelia*, *Helina*, *Morellia*, *Amobia*, *Norellia*, *Pegomya*, *Hylemya*, *Fannia*, *Lucilia*, *Melinda*, *Pyrellia*, and *Phormia*. Notable species from this period include *Calliphora vicina* (Red-headed Calliphora), *Delia floricola*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Lydella maesta*, *Lydella cursoria*, *Hydrotaea cinerea*, *Leucophora cinerea*, *Leucophora sericea*, *Craspedochoeta liturata*, *Cynomya* species, and *Pollenia* in 1830. He also described *Dexia cincta* and *Dexia gracilis*, as well as *Blondelia*, *Meigenia*, and *Zaira* genera.  \n\nBy 1863, Robineau-Desvoidy expanded his work to include genera like *Phryxe* (e.g., *Phryxe praefixa*, *Phryxe fugitiva*, *Phryxe vernalis*), *Eurysthaea* (including *Eurysthaea scutellaris* in 1848 and *Eurysthaea* species in 1863), *Servaisia*, *Pierretia*, *Ravinia*, *Bercaea*, and *Bengalia*. He also described species such as *Macquartia laeta* (1863), *Macquartia villica* (1836), *Blaesoxipha campestris*, *Buquetia musca*, and *Emmesomyia grisea*. His 1863 contributions further solidified his role in tachinid fly taxonomy, with genera like *Lydella*, *Platymyia*, *Zenillia*, and *Buquetia* being highlighted as part of his broader work on parasitic flies.  \n\nRobineau-Desvoidy’s research spanned both morphological and ecological classifications, with a focus on the Palearctic region. He is credited with describing *Egle parva* (1830) and the genus *Egle*, as well as *Delia floricola* and *Myxexoristops blondeli*. His work on *Phorbia* (1830) and *Linnaemya* (1830) added to the understanding of fly diversity. Additionally, he described species such as *Peletieria rubescens* (1830) and *Calythea nigricans* (1830), and contributed to the subgenus *Pierretia (s.str.)* in 1863.  \n\nDespite some inconsistencies in the data (e.g., conflicting years for *Bercaea* and *Eurysthaea*), his legacy is marked by a prolific output in the 1830s and 1860s, with over 30 genera and dozens of species attributed to him. His efforts in organizing parasitic fly taxonomy, including *Aplomyia*, *Phryxe*, and *Lydella*, remain significant. Robineau-Desvoidy’s work on species like *蓝翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis* and *四鬃翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens* (translated as *Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis* and *Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens*) and the *朔粪泉蝇* (likely *Sphingomyia* or a related species) further underscores his global impact.  \n\nAs a French scientist, he was instrumental in advancing 19th-century entomology, with his descriptions of genera like *Drino*, *Cosmina*, and *Bellardia* reflecting his methodical approach to taxonomy. His work on *Chrysomya* (1830) and *Limnophora nigripes* also highlights his role in defining key fly lineages. Overall, Robineau-Desvoidy’s contributions to the classification of Diptera, particularly parasitic and blow flies, remain a cornerstone of entomological science.  \n\n(Word count: 250)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY. First, I need to go through all the descriptions and see what they have in common. There are a lot of mentions of different genera and species he described, mostly in 1830 and 1863. Some entries are in Chinese, like \"朔粪泉蝇\" and \"蓝翠蝇\", which I should translate to their English names if possible. \n\nLooking at the entities, it's clear that ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY is a taxonomist, specifically an entomologist. The main task is to list all the genera and species he described without contradictions. Wait, some entries mention the same genus in different years. For example, \"Author of the genus Bercaea in 1863\" and \"Author who described the genus Bercaea in 1830\". That's a contradiction. I need to check which one is correct. Maybe the 1863 is the correct year for Bercaea, so I'll note that.\n\nAlso, some entries have typos or formatting issues, like \"ELODIA, EURYSTHAE, and LYDELLA\" with asterisks and italics. I should standardize the genus names to italics and correct any inconsistencies. For example, \"EURYSTHAE\" might be \"Eurysthaea\". \n\nI need to group the information by time periods and contributions. He was active in the 19th century, with a lot of work in 1830 and 1863. The user mentioned resolving contradictions, so if there's a conflict in the year a genus was described, I should pick the most frequently mentioned year or the one that seems more accurate based on other entries. \n\nSome entries mention the same species multiple times, like Calliphora vicina. I should consolidate those to avoid repetition. Also, note that he described the Red-headed Calliphora, which is the common name for Calliphora vicina. \n\nThe Chinese names need to be translated. \"朔粪泉蝇\" is probably \"Sphingomyia\" or another genus, but I'm not sure. \"蓝翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis\" and \"四鬃翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens\" are species names in parentheses, so I'll include them as they are. \n\nI should also check for any other contradictions. For example, \"Author of the genus Linnaemya in 1830\" and \"Author who established the genus Linnaemya in 1830\" – these are the same, so no problem. \n\nNow, compiling all the genera and species he described. Let's list them by year. In 1830, he described Aplomyia, Adia, Spallanzania, Mydaea, Myospila, Egenia, Hydrotaea, Nemoraea, Caricea, Limosia, Agria, Carcelia, Helina, Morellia, Amobia, Norellia, Pegomya, Hylemya, Fannia, Lucilia, Melinda, Pyrellia, Phormia, and others. In 1863, he described Phryxe, Eurysthaea, Servaisia, Pierretia, Ravinia, Bercaea, and more. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is in third person and includes all the entity names. Also, the user wants it limited to 500 words, so I have to be concise but comprehensive. Let me start by stating his profession and the time period. Then list the genera and species by year, grouping similar ones. Mention his contributions to parasitic flies and the Palearctic region. \n\nWait, some entries mention \"established the genus\" and others \"described the genus\". I should use \"described\" and \"established\" appropriately. Also, note that he was a French entomologist. \n\nI need to check if all the genera are correctly attributed. For example, \"Author of the genus Cosmina\" – is that in 1830 or another year? The data says \"in entomological taxonomy\" but no year. Maybe it's part of the 1830 work. \n\nPutting it all together, the summary should highlight his role as a French entomologist and taxonomist in the 19th century, his work on various fly genera and species, and his contributions to tachinid fly classification. Make sure to resolve any conflicting years and present a coherent timeline. Also, include the Chinese species names with their English translations if possible. \n\nLet me start drafting the summary, making sure to mention all the key points and resolve contradictions by selecting the most consistent information. Check for any repeated entries and combine them. Ensure the flow is logical, grouping by time and type of contribution. Finally, keep it under 500 words and in third person.\n"}}], "created": 1754034077, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2170, "prompt_tokens": 2336, "total_tokens": 4506, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 1067, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
