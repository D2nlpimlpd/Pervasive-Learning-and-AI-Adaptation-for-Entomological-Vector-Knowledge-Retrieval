Morphologically, it is characterized by pointed anal and lateral caudal lobes, with a single bristle located at the tip of the anal lobe. The species has a body length of approximately 4–5 mm, distinguishing it within its taxonomic group. Its distribution spans multiple regions, including the Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning, as well as Japan, where it is found on the islands of Hokkaido and Honshu. Additionally, *Chirosia betuleti* is present in Europe, with Sweden noted as the type locality, indicating the original location from which the species was described.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided for the entity \"CHIROSIA BETULETI\". The data includes two descriptions. First, I need to check if there's any contradiction between them.\n\nLooking at the first description: it mentions the species was described by Ringdahl in 1935, has pointed anal and lateral caudal lobes, a single bristle at the anal lobe tip, body length 4-5 mm, and distribution in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu), and Europe (Sweden, the type locality). The second description says it's a species within the genus Chirosia, described by Ringdahl in 1935, distributed in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Japan, and Europe. \n\nSo, the key points are the same in both: the genus, the describer, the year, and the regions. The first one adds more morphological details (pointed lobes, bristle, body length) and specifies the type locality as Sweden. The second one is a bit more concise but doesn't contradict the first. \n\nI need to combine these into a single summary. Start with the full name, then the genus, the describer and year. Include the morphological features from the first description. For distribution, list all the regions mentioned: Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu), and Europe (Sweden as type locality). Make sure to mention that the two descriptions are consistent and don't conflict. Also, check the word limit—500 words is a lot, but the info here is minimal, so it should fit. \n\nWait, the user said to resolve contradictions if any. Here, both descriptions agree on the main points. The first is more detailed, so the summary should include all the details from both. Also, the entity name is in quotes, so I should use the correct formatting. Third person is required, so avoid \"I\" or \"we\". \n\nLet me structure it: Start with the species name, then the genus, the describer and year. Mention the key morphological traits. Then the distribution, including the specific regions and the type locality. Make sure to note that the two descriptions are consistent. Keep it concise but comprehensive. Check for any missing info. The body length is 4-5 mm, which is important. The type locality is Sweden, so that's a key point. \n\nI think that's all. Just need to present the combined information clearly without any contradictions. The final summary should be a single paragraph, third person, with all the details included. Let me put it all together now.\n"}}], "created": 1753954170, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 777, "prompt_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 1040, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 569, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
