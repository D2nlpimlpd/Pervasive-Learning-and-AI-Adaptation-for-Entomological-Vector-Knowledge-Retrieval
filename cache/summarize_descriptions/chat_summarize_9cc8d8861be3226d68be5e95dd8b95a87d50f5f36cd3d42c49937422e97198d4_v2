It is characterized by distinct morphological traits in both larval and adult stages. Larvae of Sarcophagininae possess **12 or more short projections on the eighth abdominal segment**, a key diagnostic feature distinguishing them from other subfamilies. Additionally, their pharyngeal bones exhibit a **dorsal angle longer than the ventral angle**, further aiding in identification. The subfamily is also notable for its **tribal classification system based on morphological characteristics**, which provides a structured framework for taxonomic study.  \n\nOne of its tribes is associated with a **specific female abdominal morphology**, described as the \"second type\" in some classifications. This tribal distinction highlights the subfamily’s diversity in reproductive anatomy. Sarcophagininae species are typically found in decaying organic matter, such as carrion or dung, where their larvae develop. Adults are often metallic in coloration, a common trait among Sarcophagidae, and play roles in decomposition and nutrient cycling.  \n\nThe data provided contains a minor contradiction: one description refers to Sarcophagininae as a \"subfamily under Sarcophagidae,\" while another mistakenly labels it as a \"tribe within the Sarcophagidae subfamily.\" This is resolved by clarifying that Sarcophagininae is a subfamily, with tribes (e.g., the one linked to the second type of female abdominal morphology) nested within it. The subfamily’s defining larval features and tribal classification system remain consistent across sources.  \n\nIn summary, Sarcophagininae is a taxonomically distinct subfamily of flesh flies, marked by unique larval anatomy, pharyngeal bone asymmetry, and a morphological key for tribal identification. Its ecological role and taxonomic structure underscore its significance in entomological research.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about \"SARCOPHAGINAE\". First, I need to parse the entities and descriptions. The entity is Sarcophagininae, a subfamily under Sarcophagidae. The descriptions mention various characteristics: larvae with 12+ short projections on the eighth abdominal segment, dorsal angle longer than ventral on pharyngeal bones, a key to tribes based on morphology, and a tribe linked to a specific female abdominal morphology.\n\nWait, the last description says \"Tribe within the Sarcophagidae subfamily...\" but the entity is a subfamily. That might be a contradiction. The user mentioned resolving contradictions, so I need to check if Sarcophagininae is a subfamily or a tribe. From my knowledge, Sarcophagininae is indeed a subfamily, so the last point might be incorrect. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant a tribe within Sarcophagininae. I should adjust that in the summary.\n\nNext, I need to combine all the information. Start by stating it's a subfamily of Sarcophagidae. Then mention the larval features: 12+ short projections on the eighth abdominal segment and the pharyngeal bone angles. The third description talks about a key to tribes based on morphology, so I should include that. The fourth point, if corrected, refers to a tribe within Sarcophagininae having a specific female abdominal morphology. I need to clarify that it's a tribe, not the subfamily itself, to avoid confusion.\n\nCheck for any other contradictions. The first two descriptions agree on the subfamily classification. The third and fourth are about classification within the subfamily. So the main contradiction is the last description's mention of a tribe within the subfamily. Resolving that by specifying it's a tribe within Sarcophagininae. Also, ensure all entity names are included and the summary is in third person. Keep it under 500 words. Let me structure the summary step by step, making sure each point is addressed without overlap. Finally, verify the word count and coherence.\n"}}], "created": 1754029923, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 881, "prompt_tokens": 255, "total_tokens": 1136, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 463, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
