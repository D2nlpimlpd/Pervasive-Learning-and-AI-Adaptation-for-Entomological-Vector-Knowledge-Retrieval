It is characterized by distinct morphological features, including rounded anal and lateral caudal lobes, and a body length of approximately 5 mm. The species exhibits a broad geographic distribution, spanning multiple regions across Asia and Europe. It has been recorded in **Liaoning Province** (specifically in **Benxi Nandian**), **Tibet** (with a documented presence in **Motuo**), and **Japan** (particularly in **Hokkaido**). Additionally, *Chirosia similata* is found in **Europe**, where **Helsinki** serves as the type locality, marking the original location from which the species was described. The inclusion of these specific sites within the broader regions highlights its adaptability to diverse habitats. While the two descriptions provided align on the taxonomic classification, year of description, and general distribution, the first offers more detailed locality information, which is integrated here to form a comprehensive overview.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided for \"CHIROSIA SIMILATA\". The entities are the same, so I just need to combine the two descriptions.\n\nFirst, I'll check both descriptions. The first one mentions it's a species of fly described by Tiensuu in 1939, with specific physical characteristics: rounded anal and lateral caudal lobes, body length 5 mm. The distribution includes Liaoning (Benxi Nandian), Tibet (Motuo), Japan (Hokkaido), and Europe (Helsinki, the type locality). The second description says it's within the genus Chirosia, described by Tiensuu in 1939, distributed in the same regions but without the specific locations like Benxi Nandian, Motuo, Hokkaido, and Helsinki. \n\nI need to make sure the summary includes all the details from both. The key points are the genus, the year of description, the physical traits, and the distribution. The first description gives more specific locations, so I should include those. Also, note that Helsinki is the type locality. \n\nWait, the second description just lists the regions without the specific places. So in the summary, I should mention both the regions and the specific locations from the first description. Also, the first one says \"a species of fly\", which is important. The second one just says \"a species within the genus Chirosia\", so I need to combine that. \n\nAre there any contradictions? The year is the same, 1939. The genus is the same, Chirosia. The distribution is the same regions but with more specifics in the first. So no contradictions, just more details in the first. \n\nI should start by stating the full name, genus, and the describer. Then mention the physical characteristics. Then the distribution, including the specific locations and noting Helsinki as the type locality. Also, the body length is 5 mm. \n\nMake sure it's in third person and includes the entity names. Keep it under 500 words. Let me structure it: \n\n1. Full name and classification (genus, species).\n2. Describer and year.\n3. Physical traits.\n4. Distribution with specific locations and note on type locality.\n5. Combine all info coherently.\n\nCheck for redundancy. The second description is a bit more general, so the first one has the specifics. Need to integrate both. Also, ensure that the summary is concise but includes all necessary details. \n\nDouble-check the regions: Liaoning, Tibet, Japan, Europe. Specific places in each: Benxi Nandian in Liaoning, Motuo in Tibet, Hokkaido in Japan, Helsinki in Europe. \n\nYes, that's all. Now, write the summary in third person, making sure to mention the entity name each time. Avoid any markdown. Keep it natural and flow smoothly.\n"}}], "created": 1753954168, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 862, "prompt_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 1113, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 614, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
