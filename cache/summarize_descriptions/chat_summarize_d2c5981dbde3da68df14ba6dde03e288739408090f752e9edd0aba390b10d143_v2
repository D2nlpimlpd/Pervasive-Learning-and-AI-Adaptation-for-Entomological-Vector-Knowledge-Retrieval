First, I need to check if there's any contradiction between them.\n\nThe first description mentions the body length is 4.5 mm, distribution in Gansu (Diebu, type locality), and the source as \"Northeast Forestry University Journal 1982(1):9, Fig.8\" with an illustration on page 59. The second description is shorter, just stating it's a fly species described by Fan and Ge in 1982. \n\nNo contradictions here. Both agree on the authors and year. The first one has more details. I need to combine them into a single summary. Make sure to use third person and include the entity name. Also, keep it under 500 words. \n\nStart by stating the full name and the authors. Mention the body length and distribution. Include the type locality. Then reference the original description and the journal. Note the illustration page. The second description is redundant since the first already includes the authors and year. So the summary should be concise, combining all the info from the first description. Check for any missing details. All seems covered. Make sure the name is in italics as per scientific naming conventions. Also, verify the journal citation format. The user provided it as \"Northeast Forestry University Journal 1982(1):9, Fig.8\" and page 59 for the illustration. Need to present that accurately. \n\nFinal check: third person, all entity names included, no contradictions, within word limit. Looks good.
