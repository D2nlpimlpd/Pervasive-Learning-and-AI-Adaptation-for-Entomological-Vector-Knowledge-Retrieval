The specific mention of 1911 in the second description aligns with the first, confirming the year of the initial description of *Blaesoxipha litoralis* in this journal. Together, these details establish *Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift* as both the authoritative German journal in entomology and the historical source for the taxonomic introduction of *Blaesoxipha litoralis*. The entity’s role in entomological science is underscored by its long-standing reputation for publishing rigorous research, including foundational works like the 1911 description of this species. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both consistently identify the journal and its connection to the first description of *Blaesoxipha litoralis*.

The user wants me to generate a comprehensive summary of the data provided. The entities are \"DEUTS,ENT.ZEITS.\" and the descriptions mention that it's the German journal where Blaesoxipha litoralis was first described, and another one says it was described in 1911. \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the entity correctly. The abbreviation \"DEUTS,ENT.ZEITS.\" probably stands for \"Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift,\" which is a German entomology journal. The user provided two descriptions: one states it's the journal where the species was first described, and the other adds the year 1911. \n\nI should check if there's any contradiction between the two. The first one just mentions the journal, the second gives a specific year. Since both are about the same entity and the same event (first description of the species), the year is an additional detail. So, the summary should combine both pieces of information.\n\nNext, I need to write in third person and include the entity names for context. The full name of the journal is important here. Also, the user wants the summary to be under 500 words, but since there's not much data, it should be straightforward.\n\nI should start by stating the full name of the journal and its abbreviation. Then mention that it's a German entomology journal. After that, combine the two descriptions: the first description of Blaesoxipha litoralis in this journal in 1911. Make sure to note that the abbreviation is used in scientific contexts. \n\nWait, the first description says \"Deuts,ent.Zeits. (Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift) is the German journal where Blaesoxipha litoralis was first described,\" and the second says \"Deuts,ent.Zeits. is a journal where Blaesoxipha litoralis was first described in 1911.\" The first one uses \"is the German journal,\" the second uses \"is a journal.\" Maybe the first is more specific, so I can use that. Also, the year 1911 is a key detail to include. \n\nI need to resolve any contradictions. Both descriptions agree that the journal is where the species was first described, just one adds the year. So the summary should include both the journal's name and the year. \n\nMake sure the summary is concise, uses the entity names, and is in third person. Also, check the word count. Let me draft it:\n\n\"Deuts,ent.Zeits., the abbreviated form of Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift, is a German entomology journal.
