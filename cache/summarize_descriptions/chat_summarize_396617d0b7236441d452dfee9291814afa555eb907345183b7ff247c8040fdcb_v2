The country hosts a range of blowflies and muscids, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*, and the black-spotted greenbottle fly (*Caesar Greenbottle Fly*), which are found across its territory. Notably, *Lucilia sericata* is specifically associated with the Kyonggi region, while *Lucilia bufonivora* is also documented in Gyeongseongbukdo (modern-day Gyeonggi Province). The species *Chrysomya pinguis* is restricted to the southern region, and *Ophyra chalcogaster* is present in the country. Additionally, *Parasarcophaga* species such as *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Parasarcophaga polystylata*, and *Parasarcophaga similis* are distributed in Korea, with *P. polystylata* noted in Jiriwon Village.  \n\nKorea is also home to other muscoid flies, including *Anthomyia illocata*, *Anthomyia koreana*, and *Anthomyia procellaris*, as well as *Blaesoxipha litoralis* and *Fannia canicularis* (commonly known as the common housefly). The genus *Adia* and species like *Calliphora axata* (found in Seoul) are reported in the country, which is described as a \"foreign location\" for some species, such as *Sarcophaga misera*, *Sarcophaga sericea*, and *Blondelia nigripes*. This terminology likely reflects the species' broader global distribution, with Korea serving as one of their peripheral habitats.  \n\nSeveral lesser-known species are documented in Korea, including *Chirosia albitarsis*, *Horiisca hozawai*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Metopia suifenhoensis*, *PIERRETIACRINITULA*, *Strongyloneura prasina*, *Xenotachina busenensis*, and *Xanthotryxus mongol*. The genus *Dexopollenia* and *Sarcorohdendorfia antilope* are also present, with the latter noted as internationally distributed. In the context of agricultural pests, *Strobilomyia* species affect *Larix koreana* (Korean larch), as studied by 细谷, and *Haematobia irritans* (horn fly) is found in the region.  \n\nJeju Island, a distinct geographical area within Korea, is highlighted as a distribution site for certain species. The country’s southern region is particularly significant, hosting *Phallosphaera amica*, *Sarcosolomonia* species, and *Delia diluta* and *Delia antiqua* (both foreign to Korea). Additionally, *Parasarcophaga* and *Pegomya quadrivittata* are recorded in the southern part. The species *Ph. basalis (Zett.)* and *Protocalliphora azurea* are cited by Park (1977), while *Polleniopsis chosenensis* is associated with the Chosun region (historical name for Korea).  \n\nKorea is further noted as a distribution site for Chinese-named species such as 东方粪泉蝇 (*Oriental Muscina*), 朔粪泉蝇 (*Northern Muscina*), and 肖瘤胫厕蝇 (*Culex-like muscid*), alongside *Muscina* species and *Phaonia fuscata*. The genus *Winthemia* and *Xenotachina busenensis* are also present, though specific localities are not detailed.  \n\nIn summary, Korea serves as a key location for the distribution of numerous fly species, spanning both native and foreign populations. Its regions, including Jeju Island, southern areas, and specific villages like Jiriwon, are critical habitats for these insects, with historical and contemporary records by researchers such as Park and 细谷 contributing to the understanding of their ecological roles and geographic spread. The country’s biodiversity in this context reflects its varied ecosystems and climatic conditions, supporting both common and specialized fly species.

The user wants a comprehensive summary about the distribution of various fly species in Korea. First, I need to go through all the descriptions provided and make sure I include every entity mentioned. The entities are all different species of flies, some with scientific names and others with common or Chinese names. \n\nI notice some entries mention both North and South Korea, like \"Korea (North Korea)\" and \"Korea (specifically southern Korea)\". I should clarify that some species are found in both regions, while others are specific to one. For example, Ph. basalis is cited by Park in 1977, which might refer to a specific location in South Korea. Also, there's a mention of Jeju Island, so I should note that as a specific region.\n\nSome entries have conflicting terms, like \"foreign country\" and \"country\". I need to resolve these. For instance, \"Foreign country in the distribution of Sarcophaga misera and Sarcophaga sericea\" and \"Korea is a country where the species is distributed\" both refer to Korea. Since most entries just say \"Korea\" without specifying foreign, I'll assume that Korea is the country in question, and the \"foreign\" references might be from the perspective of the species' origin. So I'll rephrase those to indicate that Korea is a foreign location for those species.\n\nNext, I should list all the species mentioned, making sure to include both scientific and common names where provided. For example, \"翼阳细麻蝇\" and \"台南细麻蝇\" are Chinese names, so I'll need to check if they have scientific equivalents. If not, I'll keep them as is. Also, some species are mentioned with specific localities like Jiriwon Village or Gyeongseongbukdo, which I should include for accuracy.\n\nI need to group the information logically. Maybe start by stating Korea as a country with diverse fly species, then list the species by their subfamilies or genera. Mention the regions within Korea where specific species are found, like southern Korea, Jeju Island, and specific villages or provinces. Also, note the researchers involved, such as Park in 1977, and 细谷 for the Strobilomyia species affecting Larix koreana.\n\nCheck for any contradictions. For example, some entries say \"foreign country\" while others just say \"country\". Since the user wants a coherent summary, I'll adjust the \"foreign\" references to clarify that Korea is a foreign location for those species, but the main context is Korea as the country where they are distributed. Also, ensure that all species are included without repetition. Some might be listed multiple times, like Pegoplata virginea in two entries, so I'll combine those mentions.\n\nFinally, keep the summary in third person, include all entity names, and stay within 500 words. Make sure the flow is smooth, grouping similar species together and mentioning specific regions and researchers where applicable. Avoid technical jargon unless necessary, and ensure clarity for the reader.\n"}}], "created": 1754034244, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1582, "prompt_tokens": 1137, "total_tokens": 2719, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 635, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
