He established several genera, including *Scathophaga* (1803), *Anthomyia* (1803), *Gonia* (1803), and *Exorista* (1803), and described numerous species across his career. His work in 1803 also included the species *Exorista larvarum* (1800) and *Sarcophaga erythrura* (1806), the latter of which later became part of the *Sarcophaga* genus he formally described in 1826. In 1824, Meigen documented multiple fly species, such as *Platymyia hortulana*, *Platymyia mitis*, *Frontina laeta*, *Bactromyia aurulenta*, *Bothria frontosa*, *Zenillia dolosa*, *Pterella grisea*, and *Compsilura concinnata*. He also established the genus *Mesembrina* in 1826, contributing to the classification of species like *Phrosinella nasuta* (1824) and *Phylloteles pictipennis* (1844).  \n\nMeigen’s 1826 work was particularly prolific, with descriptions of over 60 species. These included *Nupedia aestiva*, *Nupedia infirma*, *Pegohylemyia fugax*, *Hydrophoria divisa*, *Hydrotaea bimaculata*, *Leucophora sociata*, *Phormia regina*, *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Lispe caesia*, *Lispe longicollis*, *Delia platura*, *Delia antiqua*, *Musca chrysorrhoea* (type species for *Orneocalliphora*), *Musca agilis* (type species for *Dasyphora*), *Heterostylodes pratensis*, *Phaonia errans*, *Helina obscurata*, *Helina reversio* (1836), *Hylemya partita*, and *Hyleorus elatus* (1838). Notably, he described *Calliphora vicina* (originally *Calliphora erythrocephala* in 1826) and *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum*, both significant in blowfly taxonomy. His 1826 publications also introduced the genus *Bercaea* and *Onesia*, as well as species like *Pseudonupedia intersecta* (1829) and *Pegomya winthemi*.  \n\nIn later years, Meigen continued his taxonomic work, describing *Wagneria nigrans* and *Peteina erinaceus* in 1830, and *Helicophagella melanura* in 1826. He contributed to the classification of *Tachina signata* (1824, later reclassified as *Amobia signata*), *Hydrophoria albiceps*, and *Phaonia serva*. Some of his species, such as *615四点芒蝇* and *亮绿蝇* (*Lucilia sericata*), are cited in Chinese literature, reflecting his global influence. Meigen’s descriptions often served as foundational references, with species like *Sarcophaga haematodes* (1826) and *Coenosia ambulans* (1826) remaining key in entomological studies.  \n\nDespite occasional inconsistencies in the data (e.g., conflicting years for *Siphona* genus establishment, likely a typographical error), Meigen’s legacy as a meticulous classifier of flies is undisputed. His work in the *Transactions of the American Entomological Society* (1838) and the *Zoological Journal* further underscores his international impact. By establishing genera and describing hundreds of species, Meigen laid critical groundwork for modern dipteran systematics, with his 1826 publications being among his most cited achievements. His contributions to the taxonomy of *Hydrophoria*, *Lucilia*, and *Phaonia* genera, as well as species like *Drino lota* (1824) and *Pales pavida* (蓝黑栉寄蝇), remain pivotal in entomological research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about the entity \"MEIGEN\". First, I need to go through all the descriptions and extract the key information. \n\nStarting with the entities, it's just \"MEIGEN\", so the summary should focus on that. The descriptions mention various species and genera he described, along with years and some reclassifications. I notice some Chinese names like 亮绿蝇 and 长叶绿蝇, which I should probably keep in the summary as they are, maybe with the Latin names if available. \n\nI need to organize the information chronologically. The earliest mention is 1803 for establishing genera like Scathophaga, Anthomyia, Gonia, and Exorista. Then in 1824, he described several fly species such as Platymyia hortulana, Frontina laeta, and others. Moving to 1826, there's a lot of activity: species like Nupedia aestiva, Pegohylemyia fugax, Hydrophoria divisa, and many more. Some entries mention 1830 and 1838, so I should include those as well.\n\nThere are some contradictions or possible errors. For example, one says he described the genus Siphona in 1903, but that's way later. Maybe a typo? The correct year is likely 1803. Also, some species are mentioned with different years, like Pseudonupedia intersecta in 1829. I need to check if that's correct or if it's a mistake. The user instructions say to resolve contradictions, so I'll note the correct year if possible.\n\nI should list all the genera he established and the species he described, grouping them by year where possible. Also, note any reclassifications, like Tachina signata becoming Amobia signata. The summary should mention his role as a German entomologist and taxonomist, active in the 19th century, contributing to dipteran taxonomy. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is in third person and includes the entity name. Keep it under 500 words. Let me start by stating his full name and main contributions, then break down the years and species, and mention the reclassifications and his impact on the field. Check for any repeated entries and consolidate them. For example, multiple mentions of 1826 descriptions can be grouped. Also, ensure that the Chinese names are included with their Latin equivalents if provided. \n\nWait, some entries have the same species mentioned with different years. For example, Hydrotaea bimaculata is listed as 1826 in one place and another as 1824. Need to verify which is correct. The data says \"Hydrotaea bimaculata (1826)\" in one entry and \"the 1824 description of Metopia argyrocephala\" in another. So Hydrotaea bimaculata is 1826. \n\nAlso, the genus Siphona is mentioned as 1903, but that's probably a mistake. Since he's a 19th-century entomologist, maybe it's 1803. The data says \"genus Siphona in 1903\", but that's an error. I'll correct that to 1803. \n\nAnother point: some species are described as type species, like Musca agilis being the type for Dasyphora. Need to include that. Also, note that some species were later reclassified, such as Calliphora erythrocephala to Calliphora vicina. \n\nI should structure the summary by first introducing Meigen as a German entomologist and taxonomist from the 19th century. Then list the genera he established, followed by the species he described, grouped by year. Mention the reclassifications and his contributions to foundational classifications. Finally, highlight his overall impact on dipteran taxonomy. \n\nCheck for any missing information. The data includes a lot of species, so I need to list them all without repetition. Use bullet points or a list in the summary, but since it's a paragraph, integrate them smoothly. \n\nMake sure the summary is coherent and flows well, not just a list. Use phrases like \"notably described\", \"established the genus\", \"contributed to the taxonomy of\", etc. Also, include the Chinese names where they are provided, as they add context. \n\nDouble-check the word count. Once the summary is drafted, I'll need to ensure it's under 500 words. If it's too long, maybe condense some parts, but the user wants all information included. So perhaps a concise list with years and species, grouped by activity. \n\nAlright, putting it all together now.\n"}}], "created": 1754034077, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2032, "prompt_tokens": 2520, "total_tokens": 4552, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 1029, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
