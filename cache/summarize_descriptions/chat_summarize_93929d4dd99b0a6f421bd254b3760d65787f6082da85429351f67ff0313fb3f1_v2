The province is a key distribution area for various flies, including **Parasarcophaga albiceps**, **Eutrichota inornata**, **Eutrichota similis**, **Lydella grisescens**, **Phryxe vulgaris**, **Musca autumnalis**, **Platymyia hortulana**, **Zenillia dolosa**, **Lispe monochaita**, **Lispe loewi**, **Voria ruralis**, **I. tripartita**, **Polleniopsis mongolica**, and **Stomorhina obsoleta**. Multiple **Helina** species, such as **Helina calceataeformis**, **Helina quadrum**, **Helina hirtifemorata**, **Helina hengshanensis**, and **Helina obscuratoides**, are also reported in Shanxi, particularly in the Yanbei region.  \n\nThe province hosts a range of **Phaonia** species, including **Phaonia graciloides**, **Phaonia vulpinus**, **Phaonia submontana**, **Phaonia xingxianensis**, **Phaonia wenshuiensis**, **Phaonia yanggaoensis**, **Phaonia longifurca**, **Phaonia fuscata**, **Phaonia xiangningensis**, **Phaonia youyuensis**, and **Phaonia datongensis**, with specific localities like Lin County (for 类绒粪泉蝇) and Ying County, Hanyuan (for **Phaonia mimofausta**). **Coenosia** species such as **Coenosia dilatitarsis**, **Coenosia mollicula**, **Coenosia incisurata**, and **Coenosia strigipes** are found in Shanxi, alongside **Hydrotaea bimaculatoides** and **Hydrotaea occulta**. **Leucophora shanxiensis** and **Leucophora personata** are native to the region, with **Leucophora dorsalis** specifically recorded in Taiyuan.  \n\nShanxi is also home to **Mydaea discimana** and **Mydaea laxidetrita**, **Fannia scalaris**, **Fannia similis**, **Calliphora nigribarbis**, **Muscina assimilis** (in Xingxian), **Muscidae species** like **Musca bezzii**, **Musca conducens**, **Musca tempestiva**, and **Musca autumnalis**, as well as **Cynomyiomima stackelbergi** and **Cynomya mortuorum**. Notable localities include Nanmifan, Huanglongshan, Ziwuling, and the Qinling Mountains, where species such as **Kramerea schuetzei**, **Pseudonupedia intersecta** (in Taiyuan), and **Paregle densibarbata** are found. The genus **Nupedia** (e.g., **Nupedia aestiva**, **Nupedia patellans**, **Nupedia infirma**) and **Adia** are documented in the province, as are **Lydella grisescens**, **Phorbia securis xibeina** (type locality at Nanmewan, though this may refer to Shaanxi), and **Xenotachina fumifemoralis**.  \n\nShanxi’s entomological significance is further highlighted by the presence of **Parasarcophaga polystylata**, **Phaonia longifurca**, **Paraprosalpia tibialis**, **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, and **SHUANG YANGYING**, alongside species like **Anthomyia procellaris**, **Atherigona biseta**, **Bellardia menechmoides**, and **Bercaea cruentata**. The province has been surveyed by institutions such as the **Shanxi Medical College**, contributing to records of **Hydrophoria megaloba**, **Haematobia**, and **732 HEYUAN HUI FLY**.  \n\nHowever, some descriptions mistakenly reference **Shaanxi** (e.g., **Calliphora axata** in Xi’an, **Phaonia mimofausta** in Yan’an, **Gonia picea**, **Musca sorbens**, and **Muscina sorbens** in Yulin, Dingbian, and Yan’an). These should be corrected to reflect Shanxi’s distinct ecological profile. The province’s role as a hub for species like **Cuphocera varia**, **Delia longitheca**, and **1278靴折麻蝇** underscores its importance in biodiversity studies.  \n\nIn summary, Shanxi is a critical region in China for the distribution of diverse fly species, with specific localities and genera contributing to its entomological richness. The province’s surveys and collections have provided valuable data on both common and rare species, though care must be taken to distinguish it from neighboring Shaanxi in future records.

The user wants a comprehensive summary about the Chinese province of Shanxi based on the provided descriptions. First, I need to go through all the descriptions and note the key points. \n\nLooking at the data, there are mentions of various species found in Shanxi. Some are repeated, like Phaonia species and Helina species. I should consolidate those to avoid redundancy. Also, there are some entries that mention Shaanxi instead of Shanxi. Wait, the user specified the entity as \"SHANXI\", so I need to make sure all references are to Shanxi, not Shaanxi. But some of the descriptions have \"Shaanxi\" in them. That's a problem. For example, \"Shaanxi is a Chinese province where the species was surveyed in Huanglong Mountain and Ziwuling\" – that's actually Shaanxi, not Shanxi. I need to check if that's a mistake or if the user included it by accident. Since the entity is Shanxi, I should probably exclude any mentions of Shaanxi unless it's a typo. But the user might have included it, so maybe they want to correct it. Let me see.\n\nThe user's instruction says to resolve contradictions. So if there's a mix of Shanxi and Shaanxi, I need to clarify. The correct entity is Shanxi, so any Shaanxi references should be corrected to Shanxi. For example, \"Shaanxi is a Chinese province where Fannia similis is distributed\" should be Shanxi. I'll have to go through each entry and check if it's Shanxi or Shaanxi. \n\nNext, I need to list all the species mentioned. There are a lot of them, including both scientific names and Chinese names. I should include both but maybe translate the Chinese names if possible. For example, \"614裸蹠芒蝇\" – I can note the Chinese name and the scientific one if available. Wait, some entries have Chinese names in parentheses, like \"Lin County\" for 类绒粪泉蝇. I should include those locations as well. \n\nAlso, there are some repeated entries. For instance, \"Province in China where Phaonia graciloides is distributed\" and \"Province in China where Phaonia vulpinus is distributed\" are in the same description. I need to combine those. Similarly, \"Province in China where Musca tempestiva is distribution\" has a typo, so I'll correct it to \"distributed\". \n\nI should structure the summary by first stating that Shanxi is a northern Chinese province. Then mention the various species found there, grouping similar ones. For example, multiple Helina species, Phaonia species, and others. Also, note the regions within Shanxi like Taiyuan, Yanbei, Lin County, etc. \n\nWait, some entries mention specific cities or regions in Shanxi, such as Xian, Ankang, which are actually in Shaanxi. That's a contradiction. The user's entity is Shanxi, so those should be excluded. For example, \"Chinese province where Calliphora axata is distributed (Xian, Ankang)\" – Xian and Ankang are in Shaanxi, not Shanxi. I need to correct that. Similarly, \"Province in China where Phorbia securis xibeina was first discovered (type locality at Nanmewan, Yan'an)\" – Yan'an is in Shaanxi. So those should be removed or adjusted. \n\nAlso, there's a mention of \"Shanxi Medical College conducted a survey\" – that's a good point to include as it shows entomological activity. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is in third person and includes the entity names. The user wants the final summary to be under 500 words. Let me start by listing all the valid species and locations for Shanxi, then organize them into categories. \n\nCheck for any contradictions. For example, if a species is mentioned in both Shanxi and Shaanxi, but the user's entity is Shanxi, so those should be kept. Also, some entries have Chinese names without scientific ones, so I'll note them as is. \n\nFinally, ensure that the summary is coherent, includes all the necessary information from the descriptions, and corrects any errors like Shaanxi being mentioned instead of Shanxi. Also, check for any duplicate entries and merge them. \n\nLet me start drafting the summary now, making sure to include all the species, their distribution areas within Shanxi, and the surveys conducted there. Keep it concise but comprehensive.\n"}}], "created": 1754041821, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2081, "prompt_tokens": 2147, "total_tokens": 4228, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 951, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
