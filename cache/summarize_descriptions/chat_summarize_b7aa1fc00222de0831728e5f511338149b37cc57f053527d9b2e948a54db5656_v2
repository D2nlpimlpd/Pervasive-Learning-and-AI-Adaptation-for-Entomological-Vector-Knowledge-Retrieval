This species is characterized by a body length of approximately 7–8 millimeters, placing it within the typical size range for members of its genus. *Helina obscurata* is distributed across multiple regions, including several provinces in China such as Heilongjiang, Jilin (specifically the Changbai Mountain area), Shanxi, and Gansu. Its range extends internationally to Japan, the former Soviet Union, and parts of Europe. The inclusion of both specific Chinese locations and broader international regions highlights its presence in temperate and possibly subarctic climates, given the geographical diversity of its habitats. The species is notable for being one of the earlier described *Helina* flies, reflecting Meigen’s foundational work in dipteran taxonomy. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the taxonomic classification, size, and geographic distribution.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided for \"HELINA OBSCURATA\". The entities are the same, so I just need to focus on that one. The descriptions mention it's a fly species described by Meigen in 1826, with body length 7-8 mm. It's found in several regions in China and internationally in Japan, the Soviet Union, and Europe.\n\nFirst, I need to combine the two descriptions. The first one has more details about the body length and distribution, while the second is a bit more concise. I should start by stating the full name and the fact that it's a species of fly. Then mention the year it was described by Meigen. The body length is 7-8 mm, so that's important to include. \n\nNext, the geographical distribution. The first description lists Heilongjiang, Jilin (Changbai Mountain), Shanxi, Gansu in China, and then Japan, the Soviet Union, and Europe. I need to present this in a clear way, maybe grouping the Chinese provinces first and then the international locations. \n\nWait, the second description just says \"described by Meigen\" without the year. The first one has 1826, so I should use that. Also, the body length is only mentioned in the first description. I need to make sure all the info is included. \n\nAre there any contradictions? The two descriptions don't seem to contradict each other. The second one is a subset of the first. So I can just merge them. \n\nThird person is required, so avoid using \"I\" or \"we\". Also, include the entity names for context. The user wants the summary to be under 500 words, but since the data is minimal, it should be easy. \n\nLet me structure it: Start with the species name, taxonomist, year, body length, then distribution. Make sure to mention all the regions listed. Check for any missing info. The first description has more details, so the summary should include all of that. \n\nI think that's all. Just need to write it in a coherent, concise manner without any markdown. Let me put it all together now.\n"}}], "created": 1754105233, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 703, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 924, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 466, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
