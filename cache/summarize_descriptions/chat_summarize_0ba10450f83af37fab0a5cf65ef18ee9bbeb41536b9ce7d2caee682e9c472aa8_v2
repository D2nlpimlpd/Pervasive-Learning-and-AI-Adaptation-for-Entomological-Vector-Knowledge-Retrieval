Their career spans multiple decades, beginning with a 1959 study on larval development in human feces and continuing through the 1990s, during which they made significant contributions to the taxonomy of Diptera. FAN established the **Blaesoxiphini tribe** in 1965 and co-founded the subgenus **Apicamplexa** with Qian. They also described the genus **Sinochirosia** in 1988 and **Burmanomyia** in 1964. Collaborations with Fang and Wang further enriched their work, including co-describing *Isomyia latimarginata*, *Isomyia lingulata*, *Isomyia furcicula* (1986), and *Lispe lanceoseta* (1981).  \n\nFAN’s taxonomic contributions include over 50 species and subspecies. Early works from 1965 feature *Mesembrina montana asternopleuralis*, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) shenyangensis*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) hainanensis*, *Musca pilifacies*, *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Pegomya japonica mokanensis*, *Pegomya chinensis*, *Metopia amamiensis*, *Musca tibetana*, *Pollenia rudis*, *Protocalliphora lii*, *Craspedochoeta pullulula*, and *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia*. In 1964, they described *Heteronychia quoi*, and in 1965, the Chinese flat-headed fly *Catapicephala sinica*. The 1970s saw the description of *Coelomyia ctenophora* in 1974, while the 1980s marked a period of expanded focus, including *Delia tenuipensis*, *Delia quadrilateralis* (1982), *Delia latissima*, *Delia penicillella*, and *Delia sphaerobasis* (1984). They also co-authored descriptions of *Hydrophoria pronata* (with Qian), *Paradelia nototrigona*, *Lasiomma graciliapicum*, and *Lasiomma divergens* (1982).  \n\nFAN’s research on **Drymeia** species includes *Drymeia cinerascens*, *Drymeia pectinitibia*, *Drymeia oculipilosa*, *Drymeia brevifacies*, and *Drymeia yadongensis*, alongside *Dexopollenia uniseta* and *Hylemya bruneipalpis* (1982). In the 1980s and 1990s, they described *Pegohylemyia mediospicula* (拟山字泉种蝇) and *Pegohylemyia qinghaisenecio* (青泽菊泉种蝇) in 1984, as well as *Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis*, *Pegomya crinisternita*, and *Pegomya tenuiramula* in 1982. Collaborative efforts led to the co-establishment of the subgenus **Deliomyia** (1988) and **Sinolucilia** (1965), and the description of *Lispe anthomyioides* (1988) and *Egle anthomyioides*. Notable works from 1982 include *Hypoderma qinghaiense* and *Calliphora zaidamensis* (1984).  \n\nTheir legacy is further underscored by descriptions of **Phaonia** species such as *Phaonia lucidula*, *Phaonia insetitibia*, *Phaonia paucispina*, and *Phaonia latimargina*, often in collaboration with Fang. In 1990, FAN described *Syngamoptera gigas* and *Syngamoptera angustifrons*, while 1988 saw the subspecies *Adia grisella asiatica* and *Mesembrina resplendens ciliimaculata* (1965). Additional genera and species attributed to FAN include *Ceylonomyia* (1981), *Bengalia (Ochromyia) taiwanensis* (1981), *Polleniopsis lata* and *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, and *Tuberomembrana* (1981). They also described *Xenotachina* species as new to science and co-established the subgenus *Paradichosia blaesostyla* and *Paradichosia kangdingensis*.  \n\nFAN’s research was published in prominent journals such as *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, *昆虫学研究集刊*, and *昆虫分类学报*, solidifying their role in advancing entomological taxonomy in China. Their work on genera like *Alliopsis* (e.g., *Alliopsis gigantosternita*, *Alliopsis rectiforceps*, *Alliopsis heterophalla*) and *Pierretia bihami* (1981 with Qian) highlights their interdisciplinary impact. With a career spanning critical taxonomic advancements and collaborations, FAN’s contributions remain foundational to the study of Chinese Diptera.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about the entity \"FAN\". First, I need to make sure I understand all the information given. \n\nLooking at the first description, FAN is a Chinese entomologist and taxonomist known for classifying flies in Syrphidae, Calliphoridae, etc. They established the Blaesoxiphini tribe in 1965 and co-established Apicamplexa with Qian. Also, they described Sinochirosia in 1988 and Burmanomyia in 1964. There are a bunch of species listed from 1965 onwards, including some co-authored works with Fang and others. The second description adds Coelomyia ctenophora in 1974. The third is Heteronychia quoi in 1964, and the fourth is Catapicephala sinica in 1965.\n\nI need to combine all these into one coherent summary. The key points are FAN's role as a Chinese entomologist, their contributions to taxonomy, the tribes and subgenera they established, the various species and subspecies they described, the time periods (1959 to 1990s), and the journals they published in. \n\nWait, the first description mentions a 1959 study on larval development in human feces. That's a specific detail that should be included. Also, the other descriptions add more species: Coelomyia ctenophora, Heteronychia quoi, and Catapicephala sinica. I need to integrate these into the list of species without making it too cluttered. \n\nI should check for any contradictions. The first description says FAN described *Mesembrina resplendens ciliimaculata* in 1965, and the fourth mentions Catapicephala sinica in 1965. The other species from the additional descriptions are in 1964 and 1974, so the years don't conflict. \n\nNow, structuring the summary. Start with FAN's identity and main contributions. Then mention the tribes and subgenera established. Next, list the key species and subspecies, grouping them by time periods and collaborators. Include the journals they published in. Finally, note the legacy with over 50 species and subspecies. \n\nMake sure to use third person and include entity names. Also, keep it under 500 words. Let me check the word count as I go. Need to avoid repetition and ensure all data points are covered. For example, the 1959 study is important to show the start of their work. The 1980s and 1990s contributions should be grouped. \n\nI should also mention the collaborations with Qian, Fang, and Wang. The species like Coelomyia ctenophora, Heteronychia quoi, and Catapicephala sinica from the additional descriptions need to be included in the list. Maybe add a sentence that says \"Additionally, FAN described...\" to incorporate those. \n\nCheck if all the genera and species are correctly attributed. For example, the first description lists several species from 1965, 1982, 1984, etc. The other descriptions add more species in different years. Need to make sure the timeline is accurate. \n\nAlso, the user mentioned resolving contradictions if any. I don't see any here, just more data points. So just combine them. \n\nFinally, ensure the summary is concise but comprehensive, flows well, and all key contributions are highlighted.
