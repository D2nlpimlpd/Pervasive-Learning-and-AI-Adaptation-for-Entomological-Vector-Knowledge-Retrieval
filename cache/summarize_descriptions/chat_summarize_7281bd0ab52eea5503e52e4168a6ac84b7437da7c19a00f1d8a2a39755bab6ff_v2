It is distinguished by its unique bristle patterns and a body length of 7.5–9 mm. Historically, this species was misidentified as *Polietes lardaria* in China, but subsequent taxonomic revisions have clarified its distinct status. *Polietes nigrolimbata* is native to several regions in China, including Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, and Sichuan, as well as to Mongolia, Japan, the former USSR, Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Its global distribution spans temperate and subarctic zones, reflecting adaptability to diverse climates. The correction of its misidentification in China highlights the importance of detailed morphological analysis in entomological classification. This species remains a subject of interest for its ecological role and taxonomic history.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided for \"POLIETES NIGROLIMBATA\". First, I need to look at the two descriptions given.\n\nThe first description mentions it's a species of Polietes described by Bonsdorff in 1866, previously misidentified as Polietes lardaria in China. The second one says it's a species of fly, also by Bonsdorff in 1866, with specific physical traits and a distribution list that includes China and other countries. \n\nWait, the first one says \"Polietes\" and the second says \"fly\". Are they the same? I should check if Polietes is a genus of flies. Maybe the user is referring to the same species but with different common names. The key here is to combine the information without contradictions. \n\nThe first description corrects a previous misidentification in China, so that's important to note. The second gives more details on the physical characteristics and a broader distribution. I need to make sure the summary includes both the taxonomic correction and the physical traits. \n\nAlso, the distribution in the second description includes multiple regions in China and other countries. I should list all those regions. The body length is 7.5-9 mm, and the bristle patterns are distinct. \n\nI need to resolve any contradictions. The first says it's a species of Polietes, the second a species of fly. But Polietes is a genus, so the correct name is Polietes nigrolimbata, which is a fly. So the summary should state it's a species of fly in the genus Polietes. \n\nMake sure to mention the original description by Bonsdorff in 1866, the misidentification in China, the physical features, and the global distribution. Keep it in third person and under 500 words.
