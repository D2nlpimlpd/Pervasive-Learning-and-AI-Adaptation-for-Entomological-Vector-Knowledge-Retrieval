It includes the genera *Rhynchomydaea*, *Brontaea*, *Dichaetomyia*, and *Helina*, which are grouped under this taxonomic classification. The subfamily is distinguished by specific anatomical features, such as the presence of three abdominal notopleural bristles arranged in an equilateral triangle, a broad ovipositor in females, and unique wing and antennal structures. These traits help differentiate Phaoniinae from other subfamilies within the Muscidae family. While the first description emphasizes the inclusion of particular genera, the second highlights the subfamily’s taxonomic placement and defining characteristics. Together, they establish Phaoniina as a well-defined group within the broader context of fly taxonomy, with both phylogenetic and morphological significance.

The user wants a summary of the entity \"PHAONIINA\" based on the two provided descriptions. First, I need to make sure I understand both descriptions.\n\nThe first description says it's a subfamily of flies (Phaoniinae) with specific genera listed: Rhynchomydaea, Brontaea, Dichaetomyia, and Helina. The second one mentions it's a subfamily of Muscidae and lists distinguishing traits like three abdominal notopleural bristles in an equilateral triangle, a broad ovipositor in females, and specific wing and antennal features.\n\nSo, the key points are the classification (subfamily of Muscidae), the genera included, and the morphological characteristics. I need to combine these into a coherent summary. Wait, the first description uses \"Phaoniinae\" while the entity is \"PHAONIINA\". Are they the same? Probably, since the second description refers to Phaoniina as a subfamily of Muscidae. So I should use the correct taxonomic name, Phaoniinae, and note that it's also called Phaoniina.\n\nNow, the user mentioned if there are contradictions, resolve them. Both descriptions agree on the subfamily classification under Muscidae. The genera listed in the first description are part of Phaoniinae, and the second one doesn't contradict that. The traits in the second description are specific to the subfamily, so they should be included.\n\nI need to structure the summary to first state the classification, then mention the included genera, followed by the distinguishing features. Also, ensure it's in third person and within 500 words. Let me check the word count as I go.\n\nStart with the entity name, clarify the taxonomic status. Then list the genera. Next, the morphological traits. Make sure to mention both the genera and the features. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Let me put it all together now.\n"}}], "created": 1754035766, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 640, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 867, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 420, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
