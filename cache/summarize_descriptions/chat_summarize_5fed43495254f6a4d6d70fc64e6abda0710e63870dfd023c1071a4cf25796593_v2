Morphologically, it is distinguished by a shield-shaped face and a narrow face ridge that bears a single row of bristles. The genus exhibits a geographic distribution spanning several regions in China, including Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Tibet, and Heilongjiang, as well as parts of Mongolia, the former Soviet Union, and Central Europe. These characteristics collectively define Oestromyia as a taxonomically distinct group within its tribe, with both morphological and ecological attributes contributing to its identification and classification. The combination of its unique facial structure and broad but specific range highlights its adaptability to diverse environments across temperate and high-altitude zones. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, allowing for a unified summary that integrates its taxonomic history, physical traits, and distribution.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided for the entity \"OESTROMYIA\". The data includes two descriptions. First, I need to make sure I understand both descriptions.\n\nThe first description says it's a genus of flies described by Brauer in 1860, part of the Oestromyiini tribe, with a shield-shaped face and a narrow face ridge with one row of bristles. The second description mentions the same genus, also described by Brauer in 1860, but adds the geographical distribution: species found in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Tibet, Heilongjiang in China, and in Mongolia, the Soviet Union, and Central Europe.\n\nSo, the key points are the taxonomic classification (genus, tribe, year described), physical characteristics (shield-shaped face, narrow face ridge with one row of bristles), and the regions where the species are found. I need to combine these into a single, coherent summary in third person, making sure to include all the information without contradictions. \n\nWait, both descriptions agree on the year and the describer, so that's straightforward. The tribe is mentioned in the first one, so I should include that. The second one adds the geographical locations, which the first doesn't. The physical traits from the first description need to be integrated with the distribution from the second. \n\nI should start by stating the genus, the describer, the year, and the tribe. Then mention the physical features. After that, include the geographical distribution. Need to check if there's any overlap or contradiction. The first description doesn't mention the regions, so no conflict there. The second one lists specific regions, so I can just add that part. \n\nMake sure the summary is in third person and includes the entity name. Also, keep it under 500 words. Let me structure it: \n\n1. Introduction of the genus, Brauer, 1860, tribe.\n2. Physical characteristics: shield-shaped face, narrow face ridge with one row of bristles.\n3. Distribution: China's regions and other countries.\n\nCheck for any possible contradictions. Both descriptions agree on the year and the describer. The tribe is only mentioned in the first, so that's a key point. The second adds the distribution, which is important. No conflicting info here. \n\nNow, write it all together smoothly. Use the entity name \"Oestromyia\" each time. Make sure the flow is logical. Maybe start with the taxonomic info, then physical traits, then distribution. Avoid repetition. Use phrases like \"has a\" and \"with species found in\" to connect the details. \n\nDouble-check the word count. Let me draft a sentence: \"Oestromyia is a genus of flies described by Brauer in 1860 and belongs to the Oestromyiini tribe. It is characterized by a shield-shaped face and a narrow face ridge with a single row of bristles. The species of this genus are distributed in regions including Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Tibet, and Heilongjiang in China, as well as in Mongolia, the Soviet Union, and Central Europe.\" That seems to cover all points concisely. \n\nWait, the first description says \"narrow face ridge with one row of bristles\" and the second says \"with species found in...\". I need to make sure the summary includes both aspects. The example I wrote does that. \n\nIs there any missing information? The tribe is Oestromyiini, which is important for classification. The regions are all listed. The physical features are covered. \n\nI think that's it. Just need to present it in a clear, third-person summary without exceeding the word limit. Let me count the words in the example. It's around 100 words, so well under 500. No contradictions to resolve here.
