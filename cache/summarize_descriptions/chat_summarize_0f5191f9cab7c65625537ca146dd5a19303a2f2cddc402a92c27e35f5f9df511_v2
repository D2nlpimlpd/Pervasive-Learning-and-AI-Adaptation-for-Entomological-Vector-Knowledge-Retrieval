The user wants a comprehensive summary of the genus BACTROMYIA based on the two provided descriptions. First, I need to make sure I understand both descriptions thoroughly.\n\nThe first description mentions that Bactromyia is a genus of small flies with black antennae and a distinctive abdominal structure. They're found in China and Europe, and the type species is Bactromyia aurulenta. The second one adds that it's a tachinid fly described by Brauer-Bergenstamm in 1891, part of the Eryciini tribe. It also includes more morphological features: distinct bristle arrangements and a closed fifth radial cell in the wing.\n\nI need to combine these into a single, coherent summary. Let me start by identifying the common elements. Both mention the genus name, the black antennae, and the type species. The second description provides more taxonomic details like the tribe and the year of description. The geographical distribution is in the first one, so I should include that. The morphological features from both descriptions need to be integrated. The first talks about abdominal structure, the second about bristle arrangements and wing cells. I should list all these features without contradiction.\n\nWait, the first says \"small flies,\" the second specifies \"tachinid flies.\" Tachinids are a family, so that's a key point. The tribe Eryciini is part of the family Tachinidae. The type species is B. aurulenta in the first, and the second doesn't mention it, so I need to include that. The geographical range is China and Europe. The morphological traits: black antennae, distinct bristle arrangements, closed fifth radial cell in the wing, and the abdominal structure. \n\nI should structure the summary starting with the taxonomic classification, then the description by the entomologists, followed by the tribe, morphological features, and geographical distribution. Make sure to mention the type species. Check for any contradictions. Both descriptions agree on the black antennae, so that's consistent. The abdominal structure is mentioned in the first, and the other features in the second. No contradictions there. \n\nNow, write in third person, include the entity names. Keep it under 500 words. Let me start drafting:\n\n\"BACTROMYIA is a genus of tachinid flies within the Eryciini tribe, first described by Brauer-Bergenstamm in 1891. The genus is characterized by several distinctive morphological features, including black antennae, a unique abdominal structure, and a closed fifth radial cell in the wing. Additionally, members of BACTROMYIA exhibit specific bristle arrangements that aid in their identification. The type species of the genus is Bactromyia aurulenta. BACTROMYIA species are primarily found in China and Europe, where they inhabit various environments. These small flies are notable for their ecological roles as parasitoids, contributing to the regulation of insect populations in their respective regions. The combination of these traits—black antennae, closed fifth radial cell, and distinct bristle patterns—distinguishes BACTROMYIA from other genera within the Tachinidae family. Their distribution across both continents highlights their adaptability and the potential for further study into their taxonomy and ecological significance.\"\n\nWait, the first description says \"small flies,\" so I should include that. Also, the second description mentions the tribe Eryciini, which I included. The type species is from the first. The geographical distribution is China and Europe. The morphological features are all there. I added a bit about their ecological role as parasitoids since tachinid flies are typically parasitoids. But the original data didn't mention that. Hmm, maybe I shouldn't add extra info not in the descriptions. Let me check the user's instructions again. They said to include information from all the descriptions and resolve contradictions. Since the user didn't provide ecological info, I should stick to the given data. So remove the part about parasitoids. \n\nRevised version: \"BACTROMYIA is a genus of tachinid flies within the Eryciini tribe, first described by Brauer-Bergenstamm in 1891.

Now check the word count. Let me count: around 150 words. Under 500. Make sure all key points are included. Yes, taxonomic info, morphological features, type species, and distribution. No contradictions. Third person. Entity names included.
