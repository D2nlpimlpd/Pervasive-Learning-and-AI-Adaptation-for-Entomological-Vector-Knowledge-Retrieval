It hosts a wide array of flies, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Frontina laeta*, *Helina calceataeformis* (specifically in Zhaowuda League, Chifeng), *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Muscina stabulans*, *Muscina angustifrons*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Sarcophaga variegata*, *Zenillia dolosa*, and *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *albiceps*. The region is also home to *Tachina albidopilosa* and *Tachina nupta*, as well as *Peteina erinaceus* and the Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly (*Lucilia illustris*). \n\nInner Mongolia’s fly fauna includes representatives of the genera *Adia*, *Oestromyia*, *Strobilomyia* (with species like *Strobilomyia melaniola* and *Strobilomyia laricicola* in Ganhe and Guxuan), *Fannia* (*Fannia subscalaris* and *Fannia scalaris*), *Meigenia* (*Meigenia grandigena* in Dongwuqi), and *Hydrophoria* (e.g., *Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*). Specific species documented in the region include *Calliphora axata* (Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner, Hohhot), *Calliphora genarum* (southeastern Naoxintai), *Calliphora nigribarbis*, *Chionomyia vetula* (Hohhot), *Cynomya mortuorum*, *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, *Delia bisetosa*, *Delia sphaerobasis* (Ejina Banner, Lanzhou Medical College), *Haematobia titillans*, *Jingning* and *Tumertei* as locations for multiple species, and *Miltogrammoides zimini* alongside *Miltogramma bimaculatum* and *Miltogramma tibitum*. \n\nThe region is notable for its association with the *Phaonia* genus, including *Phaonia jagedaqiensis*, *Phaonia malaisei*, *Phaonia changbaishanensis*, and *Phaonia beizhenesis* (found in Guyuan). It also supports *Muscina assimilis* (Yitulihé, Tuluihé, Genhé), *Muscina sorbens*, *Muscina tempestiva*, and *Muscina atrifimbriaeformis*. Other documented species include *1238黑条蝇* (Black-striped Fly), *细角细麻蝇* (Slender-horned Small Fly), *1254钝叶污蝇* (Blunt-leaf Filth Fly), *1256黑须污蝇* (Black-bearded Filth Fly), *731 BINGLU FLY*, *Azelia fengi*, *Blaesoxipha litoralis* and *Blaesoxipha unicolor* (Keshiketeng Banner), *Brontaea* species, *Cuphocera varia*, *Dasyphora trichosterna*, *Dasyphora asiatica*, *Dasyphora albofasciata*, *Exorista larvarum*, *Gonia bimaculata*, *Kramerea schuetzei*, *Mydaea setifemur* and *Mydaea sinensis*, *Paraprosalpia recta*, *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae*, *Phormia regina* (Hohhot), *Protocalliphora lii*, *Senotainia deserta*, *Servaisia rossica*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, *Subhylemyia lineola*, and *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus*. \n\nInner Mongolia is the type locality for *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* (Alashan, Wuchuan Banner) and *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (Hohhot, Beijing). It is also linked to the Brush Spring Fly (*Anthomyia illocata*), *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (Plough Subfamily Fly), *1281毛股折麻蝇* (Hairy-thighed Folded Fly), and *1341细角细麻蝇* (Slender-horned Small Fly). The region’s ecological significance is further highlighted by studies on fly-host relationships and historical relocations of sericulturists during outbreaks of *柞蚕饰腹寄蝇* (Silkworm Decorated Abdomen Fly). \n\nKey locations within Inner Mongolia for fly distribution include Hohhot (Dagao Mountain, Naoxintai), Hulunbeier League, Alashan Banner, Abaga Banner, Shandianba, and the western Gobi Desert. The region’s biodiversity is underscored by the presence of multiple *Senotainia* species, *Sphixapata* subgenus, and genera like *Zaira*, *Protomiltogramma*, and *Prosena*. Notably, *KENT’S SARCOPHAGA* and *SHUANG YANGYING* are also recorded there. \n\nThis summary consolidates Inner Mongolia’s role as a critical hub for fly species in China, emphasizing its ecological and taxonomic diversity. All contradictions in the original data (e.g., references to \"province\" instead of \"autonomous region\") have been resolved to reflect its official status. The region’s inclusion of both common and rare species, along with specific localities, provides a comprehensive overview of its entomological importance.

The user wants a comprehensive summary about the distribution of various fly species in Inner Mongolia, China. The data provided is a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity, Inner Mongolia. First, I need to go through each description and extract the key information.\n\nStarting with the first one: \"A Chinese region where *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata* is distributed.\" So, Lucilia sericata is present there. Then there's Eutrichota inornata, Frontina laeta, and others. Some entries mention specific locations within Inner Mongolia, like Zhaowuda League Chifeng, Hohhot, Alashan Banner, etc. I should note those to add geographical context.\n\nI notice some entries are in Chinese, like \"中国内蒙古自治区，棕尾别麻蝇的国内分布区域之一\" which translates to \"Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, China, is one of the domestic distribution areas for the species.\" I need to make sure to translate those accurately. Also, some species are mentioned multiple times, such as Voria ruralis and Musca species. I should consolidate those to avoid repetition.\n\nThere are a few contradictions or overlapping mentions. For example, some entries refer to Inner Mongolia as a province, but it's actually an autonomous region. I need to correct that to maintain accuracy. Also, some species are listed with both English and Chinese names, so I should include both where possible for clarity.\n\nI need to structure the summary by grouping similar species and noting their specific locations. For instance, multiple Musca species are mentioned, so I can list them together. Similarly, the genus Strobilomyia and Miltogramma have several species, so grouping them would make the summary more organized.\n\nI should also check for any repeated information. For example, \"A region in China where the species is distributed\" appears a few times, but without specific species names, so those can be omitted unless they add value. The key is to include all the species mentioned but present them coherently.\n\nNow, compiling all the species and their specific locations. Some entries have scientific names in italics, others in Chinese. I'll need to present them in a consistent format, maybe using both the scientific and Chinese names where available. Also, note that some species are part of a genus or subgenus, like Sphixapata subgenus under Senotainia.\n\nI need to ensure the summary is in third person and includes the entity name, Inner Mongolia, each time. The user wants a 500-word limit, so I have to be concise but thorough. Let me start by introducing Inner Mongolia as an autonomous region in northern China with diverse fly species. Then list the genera and species, grouping them by type and noting specific locations. Make sure to mention the study on host relationships and the relocation of sericulturists during outbreaks as unique points.\n\nCheck for any contradictions. For example, if a species is mentioned in two different locations, I should combine those. Also, verify that all the species are correctly attributed to Inner Mongolia. Once that's done, structure the summary logically, perhaps by taxonomic groups or by specific regions within Inner Mongolia. Finally, proofread to ensure clarity and that all data points are included without exceeding the word limit.\n"}}], "created": 1754034453, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2049, "prompt_tokens": 2736, "total_tokens": 4785, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 685, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
