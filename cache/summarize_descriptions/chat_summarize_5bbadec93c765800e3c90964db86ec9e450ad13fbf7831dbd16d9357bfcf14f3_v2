It hosts a wide array of taxa, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Frontina laeta*, *Helina calceataeformis* (specifically in Zhaowuda League, Chifeng), *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Muscina stabulans*, *Muscina angustifrons*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Sarcophaga variegata*, *Zenillia dolosa*, and *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *albiceps*. The region is also home to *Tachina nupta* and *Tachina albidopilosa*, as well as *Peteina erinaceus* and *Musca conducens*.  \n\nNotable genera documented in Inner Mongolia include **Adia**, **Oestromyia**, **SHUANG YANGYING** (双阳蝇), **Protomiltogramma**, **Hydrophoria** (with species like *Hydrophoria melaena* and *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*), **Strobilomyia** (including *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Strobilomyia laricicola* in Ganhe and Guxuan), **Phaonia** (such as *Phaonia jagedaqiensis*, *Phaonia malaisei*, *Phaonia changbaishanensis*, and *Phaonia beizhenesis* in Guyuan), and **SPALLANZANIA GENUS**. Specific species like *1238黑条蝇* (Black-streaked Fly), *细角细麻蝇* (Fine-horned Small Fly), *1254钝叶污蝇* (Blunt-leaf Dung Fly), *1256黑须污蝇* (Black-bearded Dung Fly), *异聚蜂麻蝇* (Heterogeneous Bee Fly), *多斑聚蜂麻蝇* (Multispotted Bee Fly), and *华丽聚蜂麻蝇* (Magnificent Bee Fly) are also recorded.  \n\nKey localities within Inner Mongolia include **Hohhot** (Dagao Mountain, Wofosi), **Hulunbeier League**, **Alashan Banner**, **Ejina Banner**, **Jiagedaqi**, **Shandianba**, **Dongwuqi**, **Abaga Banner**, **Jining**, **Tumertei**, **Linhe**, **Siziwang Banner**, **Xilingol League**, and the **western Gobi Desert**. The northern Greater Khingan Range is highlighted for *O. tarandi*, while the southeastern part (Naoxintai) is noted for *Calliphora genarum*. Specific areas like **Genhé**, **Yitulihé**, and **Tuluihé** are associated with *Muscina assimilis*.  \n\nInner Mongolia is further characterized by the presence of **Barbata Fannia**, **Caesar Greenbottle Fly**, **KENT'S SARCOPHAGA**, **Brush Spring Fly**, **Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly**, **Charophora vetula**, **Calliphora axata** (Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner), **Calliphora nigribarbis**, **Haematobia titillans**, **Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi**, **Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia**, **Blaesoxipha litoralis**, **Blaesoxipha unicolor** (Keshiketeng Banner), **Cynomya mortuorum**, **Cynomyiomima stackelbergi**, **Delia sphaerobasis** (Ejina Banner, Lanzhou Medical College), **Delia bisetosa**, **Delia planipalpis**, **Azelia fengi**, **Bercaea cruentata**, **Coenosia dilatitarsis**, **Dasyphora trichosterna**, **Dasyphora asiatica**, **Dasyphora albofasciata**, **Helicophagella maculata**, **Leucophora unilineata**, **Miltogrammoides zimini**, **Miltogramma bimaculatum**, **Miltogramma tibitum**, **Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae**, **Paraprosalpia recta**, **Phormia regina** (Hohhot), **Protocalliphora lii**, and **Gonia bimaculata**.  \n\nThe region is also linked to the study of host relationships for fly species and has been noted for outbreaks of *Egle muscaria*, prompting sericulturist relocations. Additionally, it serves as the type locality for *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* and *1341细角细麻蝇* (Fine-horned Small Fly). Multiple *Senotainia* species, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, *Voria ruralis*, *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus*, and *Polleniopsis mongolica* are documented, alongside *Asiometopia persa*, *Baumhaueria goniaeformis*, and *Kramerea schuetzei*.  \n\nInner Mongolia’s ecological diversity, spanning deserts, grasslands, and mountainous areas, supports this rich fly fauna. The region’s role as a domestic distribution hub for species like *Musca bezzii*, *Musca sorbens*, *Musca tempestiva*, and *Miltogrammoides zimini* underscores its importance in entomological research. Specific genera such as **Zaira**, **Meigenia** (Dongwuqi), and **Prosena** are also prevalent, with *Meigenia grandigena* and *Brontaea* species noted in Dongwuqi and other areas.  \n\nThis summary consolidates Inner Mongolia’s status as a critical zone for fly biodiversity in China, emphasizing its autonomous administrative classification and the variety of habitats contributing to the presence of over 50 distinct species and genera. The region’s detailed records, including localized distributions and taxonomic studies, highlight its significance for understanding fly ecology and evolution.

The user wants a comprehensive summary about Inner Mongolia's distribution of various fly species. First, I need to go through all the descriptions provided and make sure I include every species mentioned. There are a lot of them, so I should list them out to avoid missing any.\n\nWait, some entries mention the same species in different ways. For example, \"Voria ruralis\" is listed twice. I should check if they are the same and just note that it's distributed there. Also, there are some Chinese names with pinyin or numbers, like \"1238黑条蝇\" and \"细角细麻蝇\". I need to make sure these are correctly translated or at least mentioned as they are, since the user probably wants to keep the original terms.\n\nSome descriptions specify regions within Inner Mongolia, like Zhaowuda League, Chifeng, Hohhot, etc. I should include those specific locations to add detail. Also, note that Inner Mongolia is an autonomous region in northern China. That's a key point to mention upfront.\n\nNow, looking for contradictions. All the descriptions seem to agree that Inner Mongolia is a region in China with various fly species. The only possible contradiction is the mention of it as a \"province\" in some entries. But I know that Inner Mongolia is an autonomous region, not a province, so I should correct that to \"autonomous region\" in the summary.\n\nI need to group the species by genus or common names where possible. For example, multiple species under Muscina, Sarcophaga, etc. Also, some entries mention studies on host relationships, which is important to include as it shows research activity in the area.\n\nThe user wants the summary in third person and to include entity names for context. I should start by stating Inner Mongolia is an autonomous region in northern China, then list the various fly species and their specific locations. Make sure to mention the autonomous status and the specific banners and cities where applicable.\n\nCheck the length. The user wants it under 500 words. I need to be concise but thorough. Avoid repeating the same phrases. Use bullet points or a list structure in the summary but in prose form.\n\nAlso, some entries have Chinese names followed by English translations. I should include both to ensure clarity. For example, \"肖瘤胫厕蝇 and 毛踝厕蝇\" can be translated as \"Xiao Liu Jing Ce Ying and Mao Hui Ce Ying\".\n\nMake sure to resolve any inconsistencies. For example, if a species is mentioned in two different ways, combine them. Also, check if any species are mentioned with specific localities and include those details.\n\nFinally, structure the summary logically: start with the general statement about Inner Mongolia being an autonomous region, then list the genera and species, noting specific locations and any studies or notable species. Conclude with the significance of the region in fly biodiversity.\n"}}], "created": 1754274148, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2007, "prompt_tokens": 2736, "total_tokens": 4743, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 595, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
