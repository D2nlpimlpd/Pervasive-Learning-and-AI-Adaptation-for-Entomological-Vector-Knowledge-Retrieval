It is associated with a wide array of taxa, including both native and documented species. Among the notable genera found in Beijing are **Adia**, **Bactromyia**, **Bercaea**, **Blondelia**, **Calythea**, **Carcelia** (with *Carcelia matsukarehae*, *Carcelia ambigua*, and *Carcelia lymantriae*), **Cuphocera**, **Delia**, **Eumetopiella**, **Exorista**, **Gonia** (including *Gonia chinensis*, *Gonia bimaculata*, and *Gonia picea*), **Heteronychia**, **Hydrotaea**, **Lasiomma**, **Lispe** (*Lispe monochaita* and *Lispe melaleuca*), **Muscina**, **Musca** (*Musca autumnalis*, *Musca bezzii*, *Musca conducens*, and *Musca tempestiva*), **Nemoraea**, **Paradichosia**, **Parasarcophaga** (*Parasarcophaga polystylata* and *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata*), **Pegomya**, **Polleniopsis**, **Prosena**, **Robineauella**, **Siphona**, **Tachina** (*Tachina noctuarum* and *Tachina nupta*), and **Winthemia**. Specific species documented in Beijing include *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Compsilura concinnata*, *Heteronychia quoi*, *Macronychia polyodon*, *Bellardia benshiensis*, *Bellardia menechma*, *Blondelia nigripes*, *Craspedoeta* spp., *Eumetopiella (lntermedia) luridimacula* (found in Baohua Mountain), *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (in Wofosi and Yanqing), *Graphomya rufitibia*, *Hyleorus elatus*, *Paradichosia scutellata*, *Phormia regina*, *Phylloteles stackelbergi*, *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Prosena* spp., and *Zaira* spp. Additionally, Beijing is the type locality for the genus *Hoa* and the species *Calliphora sinensis*, as well as a domestic distribution site for *Calliphora vicina* (Red-headed Calliphora) and *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*. The region also hosts *Meigenia grandigena*, *Meigenia majuscula*, and *Medina collaris*, alongside the *1431家蚕追寄蝇* (domestic silkworm tachinid fly) and *614裸蹠芒蝇* (naked tarsal芒蝇). Beijing is further linked to the distribution of *1256黑须污蝇* (black-haired dirty fly), *圆斑莠蝇* (circular-spotted fly), and *THICK RING BLACK FLY*. The municipality supports the larvae of *Protocalliphora azurea* in sparrow nests and is home to the *Brush Spring Fly*. Notably, Beijing overlaps with Hebei province in some references, but as a municipality, it is distinct. The data collectively highlight Beijing’s ecological role as a shared distribution location for multiple fly species, including both common and regionally specific taxa, with records spanning genera, species, and localized observations. This underscores its importance in entomological studies within China.

The user wants a comprehensive summary about Beijing's role in the distribution of various fly species. First, I need to go through all the descriptions provided and make sure I don't miss any. There are a lot of them, so I should list them out and see which ones are about Beijing and which might be about other cities or provinces.\n\nLooking at the data, most entries mention \"Beijing\" as a city in China. Some have \"Xiangshan\" or \"Hebei province,\" but I need to check if those are part of Beijing or separate. For example, one entry says \"A city in China (Xiangshan) where Robineauella (D.) anchoriformis is distributed.\" Wait, Xiangshan is a county in Beijing, right? So that should be included under Beijing's distribution. Similarly, the mention of Hebei province might be a bit confusing, but since Beijing is a municipality, it's part of the administrative structure, so I should clarify that.\n\nNext, I need to group all the species mentioned. There are a lot of scientific names and some in Chinese. I should make sure to include both. For example, \"614裸蹠芒蝇\" and \"1256黑须污蝇\" are Chinese names, so I need to note those as well. Also, some entries have the same species mentioned multiple times, like Gonia chinensis and Voria ruralis. I should consolidate those to avoid repetition.\n\nNow, checking for contradictions. One entry says \"Beijing is a city in China where the species is distributed\" and another says \"Beijing is a city in China where the species is found.\" These are similar and can be combined. Also, some entries mention the same genus or species in different contexts, like \"the genus Adia\" and \"the species I. tripartita.\" I need to ensure that all these are included in the summary without conflicting.\n\nI should start the summary by stating that Beijing is the capital city of China and a municipality. Then, list all the species and genera associated with it. Organize them by genus first, then species. Make sure to mention the Chinese names where applicable. Also, note any specific locations within Beijing, like Baohua Mountain or Wofosi and Yanqing, as part of the distribution areas.\n\nWait, there's an entry that says \"Chinese province where Linnaemya species are distributed.\" But Beijing is a municipality, not a province. That might be a mistake. I should check if that's a typo or if it's actually referring to a different entity. Since the user provided the entity as \"BEIJING,\" I'll assume it's a mistake and include it under Beijing's distribution, but maybe mention that it's a municipality to clarify.\n\nAlso, some entries mention \"domestic distribution location\" or \"domestic region.\" Since all are in China, I can simplify that to \"domestic distribution in China\" without repeating \"domestic\" each time. Need to make sure the summary is concise but covers all the species.\n\nI need to resolve any conflicting information. For example, if one entry says a species is found in Beijing and another says it's distributed there, they can be combined. Also, check for duplicate species. For instance, Voria ruralis is mentioned in two different entries, so I should list it once but note both mentions.\n\nFinally, ensure the summary is in third person, includes all entity names (Beijing, the species), and stays under 500 words. Let me start drafting the summary, grouping the information logically and making sure all data points are covered without contradictions.\n"}}], "created": 1754890042, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1579, "prompt_tokens": 1737, "total_tokens": 3316, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 751, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
