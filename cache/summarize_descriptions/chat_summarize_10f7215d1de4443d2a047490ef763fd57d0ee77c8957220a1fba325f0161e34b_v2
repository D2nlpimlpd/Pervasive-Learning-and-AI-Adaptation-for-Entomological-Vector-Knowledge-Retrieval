This group is notable for its well-developed facial structures, which are a key diagnostic trait. As a major taxonomic division within the fly order, Cyclorrhapha encompasses a wide diversity of species, including both the Calyptratae and Acalyptratae infraorders. Calyptratae, often referred to as \"higher flies,\" are distinguished by the presence of a fleshy, flap-like structure called a calypter covering the halteres, while Acalyptratae lack this feature and include many smaller, more primitive fly species. These infraorders represent significant evolutionary branches within the suborder, reflecting adaptations in feeding, reproduction, and ecological roles. Cyclorrhapha is a well-known and ecologically important group in entomology, with members inhabiting nearly all terrestrial environments and playing roles as decomposers, pollinators, and pests. The suborder’s defining traits, such as the lunule and bristle patterns, are critical for taxonomic identification and highlight its evolutionary distinctiveness among dipterans.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the entity \"CYCLORRHAPHA\" using the provided descriptions. First, I need to make sure I understand the data given. The entity is \"CYCLORRHAPHA,\" which is a suborder of Diptera, the order of flies. The two descriptions mention that it's distinguished by a lunule and specific bristle arrangements, and that it includes flies with a well-developed facial structure. The second description adds that it contains Calyptratae and Acalyptratae.\n\nI should start by combining these points. The key features from the first description are the lunule and bristle arrangements. The second one gives the Chinese name (环裂亚目) and the two infraorders. I need to present this in third person, include the entity names, and resolve any contradictions. Wait, are there any contradictions here? The first says \"suborder of Diptera,\" the second also says \"suborder of flies,\" which is the same as Diptera. So no contradiction there. The infraorders are Calyptratae and Acalyptratae, which are part of the suborder. \n\nI should mention the Chinese name as part of the entity's name. Also, the well-developed facial structure is a characteristic, so that's important. The lunule is a crescent-shaped sclerite, which is a key morphological feature. The bristle arrangements are specific, so I need to note that. \n\nPutting it all together: Start with the classification (suborder of Diptera/flies), mention the Chinese name, key features (lunule, bristle arrangements, facial structure), and the infraorders it includes. Make sure it's all in third person and under 500 words. Let me check the word count. The example output is concise, so I need to be thorough but not verbose. \n\nWait, the user provided the entity as \"CYCLORRHAPHA\" but the descriptions use \"Cyclorrhapha.\" Should I use the exact entity name or the common name? The entity is given in uppercase, but the descriptions use the lowercase. The example output uses \"Cyclorrhapha,\" so maybe that's the correct form. Also, the Chinese name is in parentheses, so I should include that as part of the entity's name. \n\nI need to ensure that the summary is coherent and includes all the information. Let me structure it: first, the classification, then the key morphological features, then the infraorders. Also, mention that it's a well-known group in entomology. \n\nCheck for any missing details. The first description says \"specific bristle arrangements,\" but the second doesn't elaborate. I should keep that as is. The example output uses \"well-developed facial structure,\" so I can include that. \n\nNo contradictions found, so just combine the two descriptions. Make sure to mention both Calyptratae and Acalyptratae. Also, the Chinese name is important for the context. \n\nLet me draft the summary. Start with the entity name, then the suborder classification. Mention the lunule and bristle arrangements as distinguishing features. Include the facial structure. Then note the two infraorders. Keep it concise and within the word limit. \n\nWait, the example output uses \"Cyclorrhapha is a suborder of Diptera, the true flies, and is also known as 环裂亚目 in Chinese.\" So maybe I should use the common name \"true flies\" for Diptera. Also, the example mentions \"well-developed facial structure\" and \"specific bristle arrangements.\" \n\nI need to make sure the summary is accurate and includes all the points. Let me verify the taxonomic hierarchy. Diptera is the order, so Cyclorrhapha is a suborder within that. The infraorders are Calyptratae and Acalyptratae. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the summary should reflect that. Also, the example uses \"well-known group in entomology,\" which is a good addition. \n\nPutting it all together now. Check for flow and coherence. Ensure that the Chinese name is included properly. Make sure the word count is under 500. The example is 100 words, so I can be a bit more detailed but not too much. \n\nI think that's all. Let me write the final summary.\n"}}], "created": 1754029901, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1216, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 1440, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 930, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
