It is taxonomically characterized by specific morphological traits that distinguish it from other subfamilies in the family. One of the defining features of *Coenosiina* is the presence of three abdominal notopleural bristles arranged in an equilateral triangle, a key diagnostic criterion for its classification. Additionally, males of this subfamily exhibit a non-narrow frons (forehead region), which further aids in identification. Female *Coenosiina* species are also notable for unique ovipositor traits, though the exact nature of these traits is not detailed in the provided descriptions. \n\nThe subfamily includes at least two tribes: *Lispini* and *Coenosiini*. These tribes represent distinct evolutionary lineages within *Coenosiina*, each with its own set of morphological and ecological adaptations. The inclusion of these tribes underscores the subfamily’s diversity and its role in the broader taxonomy of muscid flies. \n\nWhile the first description broadly categorizes *Coenosiina* as a subfamily of flies, the second provides more precise taxonomic and morphological context by linking it to *Muscidae* and specifying the bristle arrangement, male frons structure, and female ovipositor characteristics. These details align with standard entomological classifications, where such anatomical features are critical for differentiating subfamilies. No contradictions exist between the two descriptions, as they complement each other by combining taxonomic hierarchy with specific diagnostic traits. \n\nIn summary, *Coenosiina* is a subfamily of the *Muscidae* family, distinguished by three abdominal notopleural bristles in an equilateral triangle, a non-narrow male frons, and unique female ovipositor morphology. It encompasses tribes such as *Lispini* and *Coenosiini*, reflecting its taxonomic breadth and evolutionary significance within the group of muscid flies. These features collectively provide a framework for identifying and classifying species within this subfamily, contributing to the systematic study of fly biodiversity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the entity \"COENOSIINA\" based on the provided descriptions. First, I need to look at the two descriptions given.\n\nThe first one says it's a subfamily of flies with tribes like Lispini and Coenosiini. The second adds that it's part of Muscidae, defined by three abdominal notopleural bristles in an equilateral triangle, a non-narrow male frons, and female ovipositor traits. \n\nI need to combine these into a single, coherent summary. Let me start by establishing the taxonomic classification. Both mention it's a subfamily, so that's clear. The second description specifies Muscidae, which is the family of muscid flies. The first mentions tribes, so I should include those as well.\n\nNext, the morphological characteristics. The second description has three key traits: the bristles in a triangle, the male frons, and the female ovipositor. I need to present these in a logical order. Maybe start with the bristle arrangement since it's a defining feature. Then the male frons, and then the female ovipositor. \n\nI should check if there are any contradictions. The first description doesn't mention the family, but the second does. Since the second one is more specific, I can integrate that. The tribes are listed in the first, so I'll include them. \n\nNow, structure the summary. Start with the taxonomic placement, mention the family, then the tribes. Then list the defining morphological traits. Make sure to use third person and include the entity name each time for clarity. \n\nWait, the user wants the final summary in third person and include entity names for context. So I need to make sure \"Coenosiina\" is mentioned appropriately. Also, the length should be under 500 words. Since the data is limited, the summary won't be too long. \n\nLet me verify the terms. \"Abdominal notopleural bristles\" – that's a specific anatomical feature. \"Equilateral triangle\" is the arrangement. \"Non-narrow male frons\" refers to the forehead area of the male. \"Ovipositor traits in females\" is about the egg-laying structure. \n\nI should explain these terms briefly to make the summary accessible. Maybe mention that these traits help in distinguishing Coenosiina from other subfamilies. \n\nPutting it all together: Start with the subfamily classification under Muscidae, list the tribes, then the key morphological features. Ensure all information from both descriptions is included without contradictions. Check for coherence and flow. \n\nI think that's all. Let me write it out concisely, making sure each part is covered and the summary is comprehensive yet within the word limit.\n"}}], "created": 1754035767, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1035, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 1241, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 588, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
