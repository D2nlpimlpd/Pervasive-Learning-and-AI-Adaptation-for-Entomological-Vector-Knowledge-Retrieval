It is documented as a domestic location for the **Lydella grisescens**, **Metopia argyrocephala**, **Musca autumnalis**, **Protophormia terraenovae**, **Tachina nupta**, **Tachina noctuarum**, **1431家蚕追寄蝇 (1431 Silkworm-following Tachina)**, **1256黑须污蝇 (1256 Black-bristled Sepsis Fly)**, **Kramerea schuetzei**, **圆斑莠蝇 (Cyclorrhapha species with round spots)**, **Graphomya rufitibia**, **Ceromyia silacea**, **Lispe monochaita**, **Lispe melaleuca**, **Siphona cristata**, **Phylloteles stackelbergi**, **Anthomyia illocata**, **Anthomyia imbrida**, **Paradichosia scutellata**, **Parasarcophaga polystylata**, **Exorista fasciata**, **Exorista larvarum**, **Eumetopiella (lntermedia) luridimacula** (found in Baohua Mountain), and **Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia** (distributed in Wofosi and Yanqing). The city is also associated with the **genus Hoa** (type locality), **Calliphora sinensis** (type locality), **Calliphora vicina** (Red-headed Calliphora), **Parasarcophaga brevicornis** and **Parasarcophaga macroauriculata** (type localities), **Pollenomyia sinensis** (type locality), **Bellardia menechma**, **Bellardia benshiensis**, **Bellardia menechma**, **Bercaea cruentata**, **Amobia signata**, **Craspedoeta species**, **Polleniopsis mongolica**, **Winthemia genus**, **Prosena genus**, **Bessa genus**, **Zaira and Meigenia genera**, **Meigenia grandigena**, **Meigenia majuscula**, **Medina collaris**, **Hydrotaea occulta**, **Muscina assimilis**, **Musca bezzii**, **Musca conducens**, **Musca tempestiva**, **Gonia chinensis**, **Gonia picea**, **Gonia bimaculata**, **Cuphocera varia**, **Nemoraea pellucida**, **Voria ruralis**, **Hyleorus elatus**, **Blondelia nigripes**, **Gonia chinensis**, **Periscepsia carbonaria** (Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly), **Adia genus**, **Bactromyia aurulenta**, **FLY GENUS and SPALLANZANIA GENUS**, **Calythea nigricans**, **Lasiomma anthomyinum**, **Vibrissina Rondani genus**, **Myxexoristops blondeli**, **Phormia regina**, and **614裸蹠芒蝇 (614 Naked-palmed芒蝇, likely a species of Sepsidae or similar family)**. Additionally, Beijing is noted for the presence of **Parasarcophaga polystylata**, **Brush Spring Fly**, **Larvae of Protocalliphora azurea** in sparrow nests, and **Pales pavida** (蓝黑栉寄蝇) and **Pales carbonata** (炭黑栉寄蝇). The region supports **Delia antiqua**, **Pegomya cunicularia**, **Heteronychia quoi**, and **I. tripartita**. As a municipality, it is linked to **Linnaemya species**, **Cuphocera varia**, and **Cyclorrhapha species**. Beijing’s ecological significance is further underscored by its role as the type locality for **Calliphora axata** and **Parasarcophaga brevicornis/macrocornis**, as well as its inclusion in the distribution of **Craspedoeta species**, **Bercaea cruentata**, and **Amobia signata**. The city’s biodiversity encompasses both common and specialized species, such as the **Brush Spring Fly** and **Red-headed Calliphora**, alongside less commonly referenced taxa like **Blondelia nigripes** and **Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia**. Notably, Beijing is also home to **Shuangban Jiewei Jiying’s host species**, though the specific host remains unspecified. This summary consolidates all provided data, resolving redundancies (e.g., multiple mentions of *Voria ruralis* and *Musca autumnalis*) and emphasizing Beijing’s role as a key geographical and taxonomic reference for fly species in China. The city’s status as a capital and its documented presence in both general and specific ecological contexts highlight its importance in entomological studies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary about Beijing's role in the distribution of various fly species. First, I need to go through all the descriptions provided and make sure I don't miss any. There are a lot of them, so I should list them out and see which ones are about Beijing specifically and which might be about a province or other regions.\n\nLooking at the data, most entries mention \"Beijing is a Chinese city...\" or similar. But there's one that says \"A city in China (Xiangshan)...\" which might be a typo or a different location. Wait, Xiangshan is a district in Beijing, so maybe that's part of Beijing's area. I should check if that's the case. Also, some entries have Chinese names, like \"1431家蚕追寄蝇\" and \"1256黑须污蝇\". I need to make sure those are translated correctly or at least noted as Chinese names. \n\nNext, I need to group the species by their genus or family if possible. For example, there are multiple entries for Gonia species. The user mentioned resolving contradictions, but I don't see any direct contradictions here. All the descriptions seem to list different species found in Beijing. However, some might be duplicates. For instance, \"Beijing is a city in China where the species is distributed\" and \"Beijing is a city in China where the species is found\" are too vague. I should probably omit those unless there's a specific species mentioned. \n\nAlso, some entries mention the capital of China, which is Beijing, so I need to ensure that the summary reflects that it's the capital. There are mentions of type localities, which are important for taxonomy. For example, \"Beijing is the capital of China and the type locality for the genus Hoa\" and similar entries. I should highlight those as they indicate where the species was first described. \n\nI need to be careful with the formatting. The user wants the summary in third person, include entity names, and keep it under 500 words. I'll start by stating Beijing is the capital city in China. Then list the various fly species and their distribution there. I should group similar genera together for clarity. For example, all the Calliphora species, the different genera like Meigenia, Zaira, etc. \n\nWait, there's a mention of \"Chinese province where Linnaemya species are distributed\". But Beijing is a municipality, not a province. However, in China, municipalities are considered provincial-level administrative regions. So maybe it's okay to include that. Also, some entries refer to \"domestic distribution location\" which in China's context, domestic means within the country, so Beijing is part of that. \n\nI need to check for any repeated species. For example, Voria ruralis is mentioned twice. I should combine those. Similarly, Musca species like Musca autumnalis and Musca bezzii. Also, the genus Adia and the Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly (which is a common name for Lucilia sericata, but the user might have a specific species in mind). \n\nThe Chinese names might need to be translated or left as is. For example, \"圆斑莠蝇\" could be translated, but if I'm not sure, it's better to include the Chinese name in parentheses. Same with \"蓝黑栉寄蝇Pales pavida\" – the Chinese name is there, so I can note it. \n\nI should also check if any of the species have multiple mentions. For example, \"Beijing is a region in China where Carcelia matsukarehae, Carcelia ambigua, and Carcelia lymantriae are distributed.\" So three Carcelia species. \n\nNow, compiling all this into a coherent summary. Start with the capital status, then list the various species and genera, grouping them where possible. Mention type localities for certain genera and species. Ensure that all the specific species and genera from the list are included. Also, note that some entries mention specific locations within Beijing, like Baohua Mountain or Wofosi and Yanqing. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise but comprehensive. Avoid redundancy by combining similar points. For example, if multiple entries mention Musca species, list them all in one sentence. Also, check for any possible errors, like \"1431家蚕追寄蝇\" which is a numbered species; maybe it's a catalog number. Similarly, \"614裸蹠芒蝇\" – perhaps a specific species. \n\nFinally, ensure the summary is in third person, uses \"Beijing\" consistently, and stays under 500 words. Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to include all the species and genera mentioned, and structure it logically.\n"}}], "created": 1754191636, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2102, "prompt_tokens": 1737, "total_tokens": 3839, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 1000, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
