It is associated with a wide array of taxa, including both native and documented species. Among the notable species found in Beijing are **Lydella grisescens**, **Metopia argyrocephala**, **Musca autumnalis**, **Protophormia terraenovae**, **Tachina nupta**, **Tachina noctuarum**, **1431家蚕追寄蝇** (a parasitic fly), **1256黑须污蝇** (a black-hair dirty fly), **Blondelia nigripes**, **Gonia chinensis**, **Hydrotaea occulta**, **Muscina assimilis**, **Kramerea schuetzei**, **圆斑莠蝇** (a spotted fly), **Bellardia menechma**, **Calliphora sinensis** (Chinese blowfly, with Beijing as its type locality), **Calliphora vicina** (Red-headed Calliphora), **Parasarcophaga brevicornis** and **Parasarcophaga macroauriculata** (both with Beijing as their type locality), **Polleniopsis mongolica**, **Winthemia** genus, **Amobia signata**, **Calliphora axata**, **Craspedoeta** species, **Eumetopiella (lntermedia) luridimacula** (found in Baohua Mountain), **Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia** (distributed in Wofosi and Yanqing), **Paradichosia scutellata**, **Phormia regina**, **Phylloteles stackelbergi**, **Siphona cristata**, **Lispe monochaita**, **Lispe melaleuca**, **Ceromyia silacea**, **Chionomyia vetula**, **Graphomya rufitibia**, **Hyleorus elatus**, **Protocalliphora azurea** (larvae in sparrow nests), **Exorista fasciata** and **Exorista larvarum**, **Lasiomma anthomyinum**, **Muscina bezzii**, **Musca conducens**, **Musca tempestiva**, **Vibrissina Rondani** genus, **Bessa** genus, **Prosena** genus, **Cuphocera varia**, **Nemoraea pellucida**, **Voria ruralis**, **Delia antiqua**, **Parasarcophaga polystylata**, **Brush Spring Fly**, and **THICK RING BLACK FLY**. Additionally, Beijing is linked to the genera **Zaira**, **Meigenia**, **Adia**, **Bactromyia aurulenta**, **Craspedoeta**, **Parascelio** (via *I. tripartita*), **Anthomyia illocata** and **Anthomyia imbrida**, **Pales pavida** (蓝黑栉寄蝇) and **Pales carbonata** (炭黑栉寄蝇), **Lasiomma**, and **FLY GENUS**/**SPALLANZANIAN GENUS**. \n\nThe city is also the type locality for **Hoa** genus, **Parasarcophaga brevicornis**, **Parasarcophaga macroauriculata**, and **Pollenomyia sinensis**. Furthermore, it hosts **Meigenia grandigena**, **Meigenia majuscula**, and **Medina collaris**, as well as **614裸蹠芒蝇** (a species with a bare tarsus) and **Robineauella (D.) anchoriformis** in the Xiangshan district. Beijing’s role as a distribution site is reinforced by its inclusion in records for **Cuphocera varia**, **Nemoraea pellucida**, **Voria ruralis**, **Gonia picea**, **Gonia bimaculata**, **Gonia chinensis**, **Craspedoeta** species, **Polleniopsis mongolica**, **Bercaea cruentata**, **Heteronychia quoi**, **Pegomya cunicularia**, **Calythea nigricans**, and **Periscepsia carbonaria**. \n\nThe data also references Beijing as a shared distribution location for multiple fly species, including **Carcelia matsukarehae**, **Carcelia ambigua**, **Carcelia lymantriae**, and **Carcelia kockiana**, as well as **Onesia variola** and **Bellardia benshiensis**. It is noted as a domestic region for **614裸蹠芒蝇**, **1431家蚕追寄蝇**, and **蓝黑栉寄蝇Pales pavida** and **炭黑栉寄蝇Pales carbonata**. The municipality is further associated with **Shuangban Jiewei Jiying’s host species** and **Linnaemya** species, though the latter’s reference to a \"province\" is corrected to reflect Beijing’s status as a municipality. \n\nIn summary, Beijing is a critical center for fly biodiversity in China, hosting over 40 species and genera across its urban and surrounding regions. Its role as a type locality for several species underscores its importance in entomological taxonomy. The presence of both common and specialized taxa, such as parasitic and blowflies, highlights its ecological and geographical significance in supporting diverse fly populations. Contradictions in the data, such as references to Beijing as a \"province,\" are resolved by clarifying its status as a municipality.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary about Beijing's role in the distribution of various fly species. First, I need to go through all the descriptions provided and make sure I don't miss any. There are a lot of them, so I should list them out and see which ones are about Beijing specifically and which might be about other cities or provinces.\n\nLooking at the data, most entries mention \"Beijing\" as a city in China. Some mention it as a province, but I know Beijing is a municipality, not a province. I should correct that if there's a contradiction. For example, one says \"Beijing is a city in Hebei province,\" but actually, Beijing is a separate municipality. So I need to note that and adjust the summary accordingly.\n\nNext, I need to compile all the fly species and genera associated with Beijing. There are several Latin names and some Chinese names. I should make sure to include both where possible. Some entries have the same species mentioned multiple times, like Gonia chinensis appearing in a few places. I should consolidate those to avoid repetition.\n\nAlso, there are mentions of type localities. For example, Beijing is the type locality for the genus Hoa and some Calliphora species. That's important to highlight because it adds to the significance of Beijing in entomology.\n\nI need to check for any conflicting information. If a species is listed as being in a different city like Xiangshan, I should clarify that. The entry about Xiangshan says it's a city in China where Robineauella (D.) anchoriformis is distributed. Since Xiangshan is a district in Beijing, maybe it's part of the municipality. I should mention that to keep the context accurate.\n\nSome descriptions are a bit vague, like \"A domestic region in China where the species is distributed.\" I need to make sure to include those but perhaps note that they refer to the species in general without specific names. However, most entries have specific species, so I can list those.\n\nI should structure the summary by first stating Beijing's status as a municipality and capital city. Then, list the various species and genera found there, grouping similar ones if possible. Also, mention the type localities for certain species to emphasize Beijing's role in their classification.\n\nI need to be careful with the Chinese names. For example, \"1431家蚕追寄蝇\" and \"1256黑须污蝇\" – I should include the Chinese names in parentheses if they're provided, but also make sure the Latin names are correctly formatted with italics.\n\nCheck for any duplicate entries. For instance, \"Beijing is a city in China where Voria ruralis is distributed\" appears twice. I should mention it once but note that it's found in multiple contexts.\n\nFinally, ensure the summary is in third person, includes all entity names, resolves contradictions (like the province vs. city), and stays within 500 words. Let me start drafting the summary, making sure to cover all the points and keep it coherent.\n"}}], "created": 1754274329, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1848, "prompt_tokens": 1737, "total_tokens": 3585, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 630, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
