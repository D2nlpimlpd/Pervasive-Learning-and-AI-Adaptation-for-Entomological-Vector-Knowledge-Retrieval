His work primarily focused on describing and establishing numerous genera and species, with significant activity in 1830 and 1863. In 1830, he described or established the genera *Aplomyia*, *Adia*, *Spallanzania*, *Hydrotaea*, *Helina*, *Morellia*, *Pyrrellia*, *Fannia*, *Lucilia*, *Melinda*, *Hylemya*, *Cynomya*, *Phormia*, *Bercaea*, *Cosmina*, *Pegomya*, *Pollenia*, *Zaira*, *Blondelia*, *Meigenia*, *Caricea*, *Limnophora*, *Carcelia*, *Amobia*, *Norellia*, *Bengalia*, *Egenia*, *Nemoraea*, *Servaisia*, and *Linnaemya*. Notable species he described in 1830 include the Red-headed Calliphora (*Calliphora vicina*), *Hydrotaea cinerea*, *Leucophora sericea*, *Leucophora cinerea*, *Delia floricola*, *Phorbia* (later *Pollenia*), *Dexia cincta* and *Dexia gracilis*, *Craspedochoeta liturata*, *Myxexoristops blondeli*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Blaesoxipha campestris*, *Peletieria rubescens*, and *Myophora peregrina*. He also described the genus *Eurysthaea* in 1863 and its species *Eurysthaea scutellaris* in 1848, as well as *Servaisia* and *Pierretia* in 1863. \n\nRobineau-Desvoidy’s work on parasitic flies included the genera *Lydella*, *Phryxe*, *Platymyia*, *Zenillia*, and *Buquetia*, with species such as *Lydella maesta*, *Lydella cursoria*, *Phryxe praefixa*, *Phryxe fugitiva*, and *Phryxe vernalis*. He further described *Macquartia laeta* (1863) and *Macquartia villica* (1836), as well as *Emmesomyia grisea* and *Calythea nigricans*. Among his notable achievements was the establishment of the genus *Egle* in 1830, including the species *Egle parva*, and his association with the Palearctic region’s entomological studies. \n\nIn 1863, he expanded his taxonomic contributions by describing the genera *Peribaea*, *Actia*, *Ceromyia*, *Ravinia*, and *Drino*, alongside species like *Phaonia villana* and *Pierretia (s.str.)* as a subgenus. His 1830 works also included the genera *Bothria* and *Zenillia*, while his 1863 efforts added *Pierretia* and *Servaisia*. Additionally, he described the species *Lydella grisescens* and *Blaesoxipha campestris* in 1863, as well as the genus *Buquetia* and its species *Buquetia musca* in 1847. \n\nRobineau-Desvoidy’s legacy includes foundational classifications for tachinid flies and other dipteran groups, with his descriptions forming the basis for modern taxonomic revisions. His work on genera such as *Hydrotaea*, *Lydella*, and *Phryxe* remains critical in understanding parasitic fly morphology and ecology. Despite some variations in terminology (e.g., \"described\" vs. \"established\"), his role as a pioneering taxonomist in entomology is undisputed, with over 50 genera and species attributed to him, including the Chinese-translated *朔粪泉蝇* (likely *Suo Fenquan Fly*) and *蓝翠蝇* (Blue-green Blowfly) as *Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis* and *Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens*. His meticulous documentation of genera like *Egenia*, *Nemoraea*, and *Pollenia* in 1830, along with species such as *Helina euphemioidea* and *Helina punotata*, underscores his influence on 19th-century dipterology. Robineau-Desvoidy’s efforts in defining taxonomic features and resolving classifications for parasitic and blowfly species solidified his reputation as a key figure in entomological science.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about Robineau-Desvoidy. First, I need to go through all the descriptions and see what they have in common. There are a lot of mentions of different genera and species he described, mostly in the 19th century, especially around 1830 and 1863. \n\nI notice some contradictions. For example, one says he described the genus Adia in 1830, but another says he established the genus Adia in 1830. Wait, actually, the first one says \"described the genus Aplomyia in 1830\" and another says \"established the genus Adia in 1830.\" So maybe \"established\" and \"described\" are being used interchangeably here. I should check if there's a difference in terminology. In taxonomy, \"described\" usually means creating the genus, so \"established\" is the same. I can use \"described\" consistently.\n\nAlso, some entries mention the same genus multiple times. For example, Hydrotaea is mentioned several times in 1830. I need to consolidate those. Similarly, Lydella and Phryxe are mentioned in different contexts. I should list all the genera and species he described without repetition.\n\nThere's a mention of him being a French entomologist. That's a key point to include. The user wants the summary in third person, so I'll make sure to use \"he\" and \"his\" appropriately. \n\nI need to organize the information chronologically where possible. Most of the work was done in 1830 and 1863. Also, note that he worked on parasitic flies, which is a recurring theme. \n\nSome entries have Chinese characters, like \"朔粪泉蝇\" and \"蓝翠蝇\". I should translate those to English for consistency. \"朔粪泉蝇\" is probably \"Suo Fenquan Fly\" but maybe it's a specific species. Wait, the user provided a translation for \"蓝翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis and四鬃翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens in 1830\". So I can use the English names given in parentheses. \n\nI need to check for any conflicting information. For example, one says he described the genus Spallanzania in 1830, another says \"Spallanzania Genus in 1830.\" That's the same, so no conflict. \n\nAlso, some entries mention subgenera, like Pierretia(s.str.) subgenus in 1863. I should include that as part of his contributions. \n\nThe user wants the summary to be under 500 words. I need to be concise but include all the key points. Let me start by stating his full name, nationality, and main contributions. Then list the genera and species he described, grouping them by year where possible. Highlight his work on parasitic flies and the taxonomic features he established. \n\nWait, there's a mention of \"Acta Zoologica Sinica\" for some species. That's a Chinese journal, but the user might not need the journal name unless it's relevant. Since the focus is on the author and the species, maybe just list the species. \n\nAlso, some entries have \"Author of...\" which is the same as describing. I can use \"described\" for all. \n\nI need to make sure all the entity names are included. The main entity is \"ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY\", so I'll use that. \n\nLet me start drafting the summary. First, his role as a French entomologist and taxonomist in the 19th century. Then, the key years 1830 and 1863. List the genera he described in 1830: Aplomyia, Adia, Spallanzania, Hydrotaea, Helina, Morellia, Pyrellia, Fannia, Lucilia, Melinda, Hylemya, Cynomya, Phormia, Bercaea, Cosmina, Pegomya, Pollenia, Zaira, Blondelia, Meigenia, Caricea, Limnophora, Carcelia, Amobia, Norellia, Bengalia, Egenia, Nemoraea, Servaisia, Linnaemya, and others. \n\nIn 1863, he described genera like Lydella, Phryxe, Platymyia, Zenillia, Buquetia, Peribaea, Actia, Ceromyia, Pierretia, Ravinia, and species like Macquartia laeta, Macquartia villica, Eurysthaea scutellaris, etc. \n\nAlso, specific species he described: Calliphora vicina (Red-headed Calliphora), Delia floricola, Phaonia villana, etc. \n\nI should mention his contributions to the classification of parasitic flies, including tachinid flies. \n\nCheck for any contradictions. For example, one says he described the genus Egenia in 1830, another says \"The describer of Egenia in 1830.\" That's consistent. \n\nMake sure to include all the translated Chinese names, like \"Suo Fenquan Fly\" and \"Blue-green Blowfly.\" \n\nFinally, structure the summary with a clear beginning, middle, and end, ensuring all data points are covered without redundancy. Keep it under 500 words. Let me count the words as I go to stay within the limit.\n"}}], "created": 1754030043, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2302, "prompt_tokens": 2408, "total_tokens": 4710, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 1206, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
