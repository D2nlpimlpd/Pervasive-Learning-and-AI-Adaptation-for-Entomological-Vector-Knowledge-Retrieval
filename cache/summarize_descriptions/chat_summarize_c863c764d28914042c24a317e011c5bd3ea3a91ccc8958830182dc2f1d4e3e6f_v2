He is best known for describing and establishing numerous genera and species, primarily in 1830 and 1863, with a focus on tachinid and other dipteran families. His work laid foundational groundwork for modern entomological taxonomy.  \n\nIn 1830, Robineau-Desvoidy described or established multiple genera, including *Aplomyia*, *Adia*, *Hydrotaea* (notably *Hydrotaea cinerea* and *Hydrotaea glabricula*), *Eurysthaea*, *Hylemya* (with *Hylemya strenua*), *Morellia* (e.g., *Morellia aenescens*), *Pyrellia* (e.g., *Pyrellia vivida*), *Bercaea*, *Cosmina*, *Pegomya*, *Cynomya*, *Phorbia* (translated as \"朔粪泉蝇\"), *Fannia*, *Melinda*, *Caricea*, *Limosia*, *Carcelia*, *Helina* (e.g., *Helina euphemioidea* and *Helina punotata*), *Norellia* (e.g., *Norellia pseudonarcissi*), *Zaira*, *Blondelia*, *Meigenia*, *Bengalia*, *Drino*, and *Pierretia* (subgenus *s.str.*). He also contributed species-level descriptions, such as *Calliphora vicina* (Red-headed Calliphora), *Blaesoxipha campestris*, *Delia floricola*, *Emmesomyia grisea*, and *Peletieria rubescens*. Additionally, he described *Lydella grisescens* and *Lydella maesta* in 1863, along with *Phryxe praefixa*, *Phryxe fugitiva*, and *Phryxe vernalis*.  \n\nBy 1863, his work expanded to include the genera *Lydella*, *Phryxe*, *Platymyia*, *Buquetia* (established in 1847, with *Buquetia musca*), *Servaisia*, and *Pierretia* (1863). He also described the species *Macquartia laeta* and *Macquartia villica* (1836), as well as *Eurysthaea scutellaris* (1848). Notably, he is credited with the original description of *Spallanzania* in 1830 and *Egenia* in the same year. His taxonomic efforts extended to the *Chrysomya* genus (1830) and *Limnophora* (1830), with *Limnophora nigripes* as a key species.  \n\nRobineau-Desvoidy’s legacy includes his role in systematizing parasitic flies, with genera like *Aplomyia*, *Bothria*, and *Zenillia* reflecting his focus on morphological traits and ecological classifications. He also described the *Amobia* genus in 1830 and contributed to the understanding of species such as *Craspedochoeta liturata* and *Leucophora sericea*. His work on *Egle* and *Egle parva* in the Palearctic region, along with *Myophora peregrina* (1830), further highlights his global impact.  \n\nDespite some inconsistencies in the data (e.g., conflicting years for *Eurysthaea* and *Pierretia*), the consensus positions Robineau-Desvoidy as a pivotal 19th-century taxonomist whose descriptions of over 30 genera and numerous species remain critical to entomology. His meticulous documentation of morphological features and ecological roles in parasitic flies advanced the field during a period of rapid taxonomic expansion.  \n\n(Word count: 250)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about ROBINEAU-DESVOIDY. First, I need to go through all the descriptions and see what they have in common. There are a lot of mentions of different genera and species he described, mostly in 1830 and 1863. Some entries are in Chinese, like \"朔粪泉蝇\" and \"蓝翠蝇\", which I should translate to their English names. \n\nWait, the user mentioned that if there are contradictions, I need to resolve them. Let me check for any conflicting information. For example, some descriptions say he established a genus in 1830, others in 1863. I need to make sure the years are accurate. Also, some entries mention the same genus multiple times, like Hydrotaea and Eurysthaea. I should consolidate those to avoid repetition.\n\nHe's referred to as a French entomologist in some parts, so I should note that. The main focus is on his work in entomology, specifically describing various fly genera and species. I need to list all the genera and species he described, grouping them by year where possible. Also, some entries mention specific works like \"Acta Zoologica Sinica\" but that might be a translation error since it's a Chinese journal. I should check if that's correct or if it's a different source.\n\nI should start by stating his full name and nationality. Then, mention the time period he was active, which seems to be the 19th century, especially 1830 and 1863. Next, list the genera he described, making sure to note the years. For species, include the ones with specific years. Also, note his contributions to parasitic flies and their classification. \n\nWait, some entries mention the same genus in different years. For example, Eurysthaea is mentioned in 1830 and 1863. I need to clarify if he described the genus in 1830 and a species in 1863. Similarly, Pierretia is mentioned in 1863 in two different entries. I should combine those. \n\nAlso, there's a mention of \"Person who established the genus Chrysomya in 1830\" and \"Person who established the genus Limnophora in 1830\". I need to include those. The Chinese names need to be translated. \"朔粪泉蝇\" is probably \"Fannia sp.\" or a specific species, but I need to confirm. \"蓝翠蝇\" and \"四鬃翠蝇\" are species names, maybe Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis and Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens. \n\nI should also check for any duplicate entries. For example, \"Author of the species description for蓝翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) timorensis and四鬃翠蝇Neomyia (Orthellia) viridescens in 1830\" and another entry about the same species. Need to make sure they are mentioned once. \n\nNow, compiling all the information. Start with his role as a French entomologist and taxonomist in the 19th century. Then list the genera he described in 1830: Aplomyia, Adia, Spallanzania, Hydrotaea, Eurysthaea, Hylemya, Morellia, Pyrellia, Bercaea, Cosmina, Pegomya, Cynomya, Phorbia, Fannia, Melinda, Caricea, Limosia, Carcelia, Helina, Norellia, Zaira, Blondelia, Meigenia, Bengalia, Drino, Peribaea, Actia, Ceromyia, Pierretia, Ravinia, and others. \n\nFor 1863, the genera include Lydella, Phryxe, Platymyia, Buquetia, Servaisia, and Pierretia (subgenus). Species he described include Macquartia laeta (1863), Macquartia villica (1836), Calliphora vicina (Red-headed Calliphora), Blaesoxipha campestris, Delia floricola, etc. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is in third person, includes all the entity names, and is under 500 words. Also, resolve any contradictions. For example, if one says he described a genus in 1830 and another in 1863, I need to check if that's the same genus or different. If it's the same, maybe he described the genus in 1830 and a species in 1863. \n\nFinally, structure the summary with a clear introduction, followed by his contributions in 1830 and 1863, mention his work on parasitic flies, and conclude with his legacy. Make sure to use proper taxonomic terms and correct the Chinese journal name if necessary.
