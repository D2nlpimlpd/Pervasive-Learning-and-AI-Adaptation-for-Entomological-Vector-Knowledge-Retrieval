The genus is distinguished by a combination of morphological traits, including specific wing venation patterns and bristle arrangements. Notably, Xylotachina species exhibit **two frontal bristles** on the head, a feature critical for taxonomic identification within the group. Additionally, a defining characteristic is the presence of a **row of black bristles behind the postocular bristles on the occiput**, which further aids in differentiating this genus from related taxa. The tibiae of these flies are also marked by **spines**, contributing to their unique physical profile. Wing vein patterns, a key diagnostic feature in tachinid flies, are particularly notable in Xylotachina, though specific details of these patterns are not elaborated in the provided descriptions. The genus is part of the broader Tachinidae family, known for its parasitoid lifestyle, though the ecological habits of Xylotachina are not explicitly detailed here. All three descriptions concur on the taxonomic authority (Brauer and Bergenstamm) and the year of description (1891), while emphasizing distinct morphological markers such as bristle configurations and tibial spines. No contradictions exist in the core taxonomic or physical attributes, allowing for a unified summary. The entity name \"Xylotachina\" is consistently used across the descriptions, with no conflicting synonyms or alternative classifications mentioned. This genus remains a subject of entomological study due to its specialized traits and placement within the Tachinidae family.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about the genus Xylotachina. First, I need to look at the three descriptions given. All of them mention that Xylotachina is a genus of flies described by Brauer and Bergenstamm in 1891. That's consistent, so I can start with that.\n\nNow, the first description talks about specific wing vein patterns and bristle arrangements. The second one adds tibiae spines and wing venation. The third specifies tachinid flies, 2 frontal bristles, and a row of black bristles behind the postocular bristles on the occiput. I need to combine all these physical traits without contradicting any. \n\nWait, the first two descriptions use \"Brauer and Bergenstamm\" while the third uses \"Brauer et Bergenstamm.\" I should standardize that to \"Brauer and Bergenstamm\" for consistency. Also, the third one mentions tachinid flies, which is a family, so I should note that in the summary. \n\nThe wing venation is mentioned in both the first and second descriptions, so I can combine that. The bristle arrangements include 2 frontal bristles and a row of black bristles behind the postocular ones. The tibiae spines are another distinct trait. I need to make sure all these are included. \n\nI should check if any of the traits are conflicting. The first says \"specific wing vein patterns and bristle arrangements,\" the second adds \"tibiae spines and wing venation,\" and the third gives more specific details about the bristles. They all seem to complement each other. \n\nPutting it all together: Start with the genus name, the describers, the year, and the family (tachinid). Then list the key physical characteristics—wing venation, tibiae spines, 2 frontal bristles, and the black bristle row on the occiput. Make sure it's in third person and under 500 words.
