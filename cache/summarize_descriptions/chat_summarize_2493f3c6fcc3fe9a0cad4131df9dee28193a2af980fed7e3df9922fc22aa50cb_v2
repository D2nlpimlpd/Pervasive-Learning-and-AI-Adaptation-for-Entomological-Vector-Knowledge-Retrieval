It is distinguished by several morphological features, including wing cross-veins that lack dark fringes, a characteristic that differentiates it from closely related species. The mandibular palps of this fly are entirely black, further contributing to its unique identification. The holotype of *Phanioa angustiprosternum* was collected from Qianshan, a location in Liaoning Province, China, which serves as the primary reference site for the species. This locality is significant for understanding its geographic distribution and ecological context. The description by Ma and Wang provides foundational taxonomic details, establishing the species within the broader classification of flies. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions, as both confirm the same authors, year of description, and key morphological traits.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided for the entity \"PHANOIA ANGUSTIPROSTERNUM\". The data includes two descriptions. First, I need to make sure I understand both descriptions.\n\nThe first description mentions it's a species of fly described by Ma and Wang with specific features: wing cross-veins without dark fringes, black mandibular palps, and a holotype locality in Qianshan, Liaoning Province. The second description says it's a new species described by Ma and Wang in 1989. \n\nSo, the main points are the name, the describers (Ma and Wang), the year (1989), the characteristics, and the holotype location. I need to combine these into a single, coherent summary. The user emphasized third person and including entity names for context. Also, if there are contradictions, resolve them. \n\nWait, the two descriptions don't seem contradictory. The first gives more details about the features and the holotype, the second adds the year 1989. So I can merge them. The key is to present all the information without repetition. \n\nStart with the full name, then mention the describers and the year. Next, list the distinguishing features. Finally, include the holotype locality. Make sure it's all in third person and flows naturally. Check the word count to stay under 500 words. \n\nI should also verify if \"Phanioa angustiprosternum\" is the correct scientific name. The user provided it in quotes, so probably it's the correct binomial. No need to change that. \n\nPutting it all together: \"Phanioa angustiprosternum is a species of fly described by Ma and Wang in 1989. It is characterized by wing cross-veins that lack dark fringes, black mandibular palps, and a holotype locality in Qianshan, Liaoning Province.\" That's concise and includes all the necessary info. \n\nWait, the first description says \"features such as\", so maybe I should use \"features such as\" in the summary. Also, the holotype is in Qianshan, so specify that. Let me rephrase to include that structure. \n\nFinal check for contradictions: Both descriptions agree on the describers and the year. The features are from the first description, and the second just adds the year. No conflicts here. Alright, that should do it.\n"}}], "created": 1754105301, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 716, "prompt_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 928, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 518, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
