It serves as a key domestic distribution location for numerous genera and species, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) chini*, and *Lucilia (Bufolucilia) bufonivora*. The province hosts multiple *Muscina* species such as *Muscina japonica*, *Muscina stabulans*, *Muscina angustifrons*, and *Muscina assimilis*, with records in cities like Harbin, Qiqiha'er, Jiamusi, Yichun, and Wuying. *Parasarcophaga* species, including *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni*, *Parasarcophaga polystylata*, and *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata*, are also documented here, alongside *Protophormia terraenovae* and *Phaenicia sericata*.  \n\nHeilongjiang is notable for its *Phaonia* genus, where *Phaonia paucispina*, *Phaonia dupliciseta*, *Phaonia alpicola*, *Phaonia subvivida*, *Phaonia luteovittata*, *Phaonia mimopalpata* (specifically in Mudanjiang), and *Phaonia nigripennis* are reported. The *Pegomya* genus is represented by *Pegomya rubivora*, *Pegomya winthemi*, and *Pegomya geniculata*, while *Lydella grisescens*, *Phryxe vulgaris*, and *Acklandia aculeatoides* are also present. Specific species like *Eutrichota inornata*, *Eutrichota similis*, *Helina parcepilosa* (Harbin), *Helina confinis*, *Helina obscurata*, and *Lispe monochaita* (*Lispe sinica*) are found in the province.  \n\nThe Daxing’anling and Xiaoxing’anling regions are highlighted for *Phallantha sichotealini*, *Pierretia (s.str.) villeneuvei*, *Pierretia sichotealini*, *Pierretia nemoralis*, and *Pierretia clathrata*. Yichun and Wuying are key locations for *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Strobilomyia laricicola*, *Neomyia lauta* (black-spotted greenbottle fly), and *Polietes nigrolimbata*. Other notable species include *Calliphora axata* (Qiqihaer, Gaolingzi), *Calliphora uralensis* (Ural Calliphora), *Calliphora vicina* (Red-headed Calliphora), and *Parasarcophaga macroauriculata*.  \n\nThe province is also home to *Chirosia betuleti*, *Compsilura concinnata*, *KENT’S SARCOPHAGA*, *1238黑条蝇* (Black-streaked fly), *长板粪泉蝇* (Brush Spring Fly), and *蓝黑栉寄蝇Pales pavida*. Additional genera and species include *Zaira*, *Meigenia grandigena*, *Meigenia majuscula*, *Bessa*, *Hydrophoria* (multiple species), *Hydrotaea cinerea*, *Ophyra spinigera*, *Hydrotaea bimaculata*, and *Hydrotaea spinigera*.  \n\nHeilongjiang’s fly fauna includes rare or regionally significant species such as *Brachicoma devia* (Daxing’anling), *Chaetexorista eutachinoides*, *Myxexoristops blondeli*, and *Gonia picea*. The province is a type locality for *Brontaea nigrogrisea* and a holotype collection site for *Spilogona costalis* in Tahe. It is also associated with *Lasiomma anthomyinum*, *Lasiomma pectinicrus*, *Exorista fasciata*, *Exorista larvarum*, and *Heteronychia abramovi*.  \n\nChinese names for species in the province include 黑尾缘花蝇 (*Pierretia nemoralis*), 巢缘花蝇 (*Pierretia clathrata*), and 亚山花蝇, while localities like Gulian (for *Paraprosalpia flavipes*) and Raohe (for *Lispe tentaculata*) are specified. The province is linked to outbreaks of柞蚕饰腹寄蝇 (Silkworm decorator fly), prompting sericulturist relocations.  \n\nOverall, Heilongjiang’s fly biodiversity spans parasitic, predatory, and scavenging species, with Harbin, Yichun, and Daxing’anling as focal areas. The data underscores its ecological significance as a hub for entomological research in northern China.

The user wants a comprehensive summary about Heilongjiang province in China, focusing on the distribution of various fly species. First, I need to go through all the provided descriptions and extract the key information. There are a lot of entries here, so I should start by listing all the species mentioned.\n\nI notice some entries mention specific cities or regions within Heilongjiang, like Harbin, Daxing'anling, Yichun, Wuying, etc. I should note those locations to add geographical context. Also, some species are listed multiple times, so I need to consolidate those to avoid repetition. For example, Phaonia is mentioned several times with different species, so I can group them together.\n\nThere are a few contradictions or possible overlaps. For instance, some entries refer to the same species but with different names or classifications. I need to check if these are indeed the same or different. For example, \"Parasarcophaga jacobsoni and albiceps\" might be two species under the same genus. Also, some entries have Chinese names, like \"黑尾缘花蝇\" and \"巢缘花蝇,\" which I should include in the summary, maybe in parentheses with the scientific names if available.\n\nI should structure the summary by first introducing Heilongjiang as a northern Chinese province. Then, list the various fly species and their distribution within the province, grouping similar genera or species together. Mention key cities and regions where specific species are found. Also, note any unique points like type localities or specific subfamilies mentioned.\n\nNeed to ensure that the summary is in third person and includes the entity name \"Heilongjiang\" each time. Keep it under 500 words, so I have to be concise but comprehensive. Check for any repeated information and merge it. For example, multiple mentions of Muscina species in different cities can be combined into a single statement.\n\nAlso, some entries have asterisks or parentheses, which might indicate emphasis or alternative names. I should handle those appropriately, maybe italicizing the scientific names as per standard formatting. However, since the user didn't specify, I'll just include them as they are.\n\nFinally, make sure the summary flows logically, starting with the province's location, then moving into the list of species with their specific regions. Avoid technical jargon where possible, but since it's about species distribution, some scientific terms are necessary. Check for any missing information or possible errors, like conflicting locations, but since all descriptions are about the same entity, contradictions might be due to different sources, so I'll present the information as a compilation without resolving them unless it's clear.\n"}}], "created": 1754033386, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1666, "prompt_tokens": 3377, "total_tokens": 5043, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 548, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
