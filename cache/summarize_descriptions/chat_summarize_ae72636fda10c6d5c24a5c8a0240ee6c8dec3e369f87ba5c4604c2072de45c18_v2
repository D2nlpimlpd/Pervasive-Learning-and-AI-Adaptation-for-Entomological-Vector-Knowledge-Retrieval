It hosts a diverse array of taxa, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Frontina laeta*, *Helina calceataeformis* (specifically in Zhaowuda League, Chifeng), *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Muscina stabulans* and *Muscina angustifrons*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Sarcophaga variegata*, and *Zenillia dolosa*. The region is also home to species such as *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *albiceps*, *Tachina albidopilosa* and *Tachina nupta*, *Peteina erinaceus*, the Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly (*Lucilia sericata*), and the genus *Adia*. \n\nInner Mongolia's fly fauna includes representatives of the *Spallanzania* genus, *Austrophorocera*, *Carcelia lymantriae*, *Cuphocera varia*, *Delia bisetosa*, *Macronychia griseola* and *Macronychia polyodon*, *Mydaea setifemur* and *Mydaea sinensis*, *Senotainia deserta*, *Apodacra pulchra*, *Miltogrammoides zimini*, *Servaisia rossica*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, *Voria ruralis*, and *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus*. Specific locations within the region, such as Jining, Tumertei, Linhe, Siziwang Banner, Xilingol League, Hulunbeier League, Hohhot (including Dagao Mountain and Naoxintai), Alashan Banner, Ejina Banner, and Dongwuqi, are highlighted as sites for species like *Cephalopina titillator*, *Oestrus tarandi* (in the northern Greater Khingan Range), *Phaonia jagedaqiensis*, *Phaenia malaisei*, *Gonia bimaculata*, *Muscina assimilis* (in Yitulihé, Tuluihé, and Genhé), and *Shuangban Jiewei Jiying* (in Shandianba). \n\nThe region is noted for its *KENT'S SARCOPHAGA* (with records in Hohhot), *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Strobilomyia laricicola* (in Ganhe and Guxuan), *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* (in Alashan and Wuchuan Banner), *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (type locality in Hohhot, also in Beijing), *Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*, *Hydrotaea armipes*, *Leucophora unilineata*, *Miltogramma bimaculatum* and *Miltogramma tibitum*, *Paraprosalpia recta*, *Phormia regina* (Hohhot), *Protocalliphora lii*, *Calliphora axata* (Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner, Hohhot), *Calliphora nigribarbis*, and *Cynomya mortuorum*. \n\nAdditional species documented in Inner Mongolia include *1238黑条蝇*, *细角细麻蝇* (type locality for 1341细角细麻蝇), *1254钝叶污蝇*, *1256黑须污蝇*, *异聚蜂麻蝇*, *多斑聚蜂麻蝇*, *华丽聚蜂麻蝇*, *肖瘤胫厕蝇*, *毛踝厕蝇*, *1281毛股折麻蝇*, *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (with Guoyuan as a specific location), *731 BINGLU FLY*, *Azelia fengi*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Coenosia dilatitarsis*, *Dasyphora trichosterna*, *Dasyphora asiatica*, *Dasyphora albofasciata*, *Delia sphaerobasis* (Ejina Banner and Lanzhou Medical College), *Delia planipalpis*, *Kramerea schuetzei*, *Myxexoristops blondeli*, *Miltogrammoides zimini*, *Miltogramma* spp., *Brontaea* spp., *Prosena* genus, *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae*, *Blaesoxipha litoralis*, *Blaesoxipha unicolor* (Keshiketeng Banner), *Anthomyia illocata*, *Helicophagella maculata*, and *1396犁头亚麻蝇*. \n\nThe region is also associated with studies on host relationships of fly species and has been linked to sericulturists relocating during outbreaks of *Egle muscaria*. Notable genera with multiple species include *Hydrophoria* (e.g., *Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*), *Senotainia*, and *Strobilomyia*. Inner Mongolia's ecological diversity, spanning deserts like the western Gobi and mountainous areas such as Dagao Mountain, supports this rich fly biodiversity, making it a key area for entomological research in China. The summary consolidates all provided data, resolving minor inconsistencies in terminology (e.g., \"province\" corrected to \"autonomous region\") and emphasizing the region's role as a documented habitat for these species.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary about Inner Mongolia's distribution of various fly species. First, I need to go through all the descriptions provided and make sure I include every species mentioned. There are a lot of them, so I should list them out to avoid missing any.\n\nWait, some entries mention the same species multiple times. For example, \"Voria ruralis\" is listed twice. I should check if there are any contradictions in their distribution. The first mention says it's in Inner Mongolia, the second also in Inner Mongolia. So no conflict there. I can just note that it's present in the region.\n\nThen there are entries with specific locations within Inner Mongolia. Like Zhaowuda League Chifeng for Helina calceataeformis. I need to include those specific areas to add detail. Also, some entries have Chinese names, like \"1238黑条蝇\" and \"细角细麻蝇\". I should either translate them or keep the Chinese names if they're unique. Maybe a mix of both, using the scientific names where available and the Chinese ones where they are the only identifiers.\n\nI notice some entries mention multiple species in one line. For example, \"Muscina stabulans and Muscina angustifrons\". I need to list both. Also, some entries have genus-level mentions, like Oestromyia and Strobilomyia. I should include those as well, specifying the genus and any species if provided.\n\nThere's a mention of \"Autonomous region in China\" which is correct since Inner Mongolia is an autonomous region. I should use that term in the summary. Also, some entries refer to it as a \"province\", but I know that Inner Mongolia is an autonomous region, not a province. I need to correct that to maintain accuracy.\n\nLooking for contradictions: All entries seem to agree that Inner Mongolia is a region in China with various fly species. The only thing to watch is the specific locations. For example, one says \"Hohhot (Dagao Mountain)\" for Cephalopina titillator, another mentions Hohhot in a different context. I should combine those if they refer to the same species.\n\nI should structure the summary by first stating Inner Mongolia is an autonomous region in northern China. Then list the fly species, grouping them by genus or family if possible. Mention specific locations where applicable. Also, note any studies or host relationships mentioned, like the one about the host relationship of a fly species being studied there.\n\nNeed to be careful with the Chinese names. For example, \"肖瘤胫厕蝇\" and \"毛踝厕蝇\" – I might not know the scientific names, so I'll have to keep the Chinese names as provided. Similarly, \"1238黑条蝇\" is a species with a number and a Chinese name. Maybe it's a local identifier, so I should include it as is.\n\nCheck for any repeated phrases. For example, \"A Chinese region where...\" is used multiple times. I need to rephrase to avoid repetition, using \"is a region in China where...\" or \"has a distribution of...\" to vary the sentence structure.\n\nAlso, some entries have \"domestic distribution\" – since all are in China, maybe that's redundant, but I should include it if it's part of the original data. However, the user wants a coherent summary, so perhaps just stating \"distributed in Inner Mongolia\" is sufficient.\n\nMake sure to mention all the specific locations like Jining, Tumertei, Linhe, Siziwang Banner, Xilingol League, Hulunbeier League, Alashan Banner, Ejina Banner, etc. These add geographical context.\n\nI should also note the presence of multiple species from the same genus, such as several Strobilomyia species, multiple Hydrophoria species, and so on. This shows the diversity in the region.\n\nFinally, keep the summary under 500 words. That's a lot of species, so I need to be concise but thorough. Use bullet points or a list format if possible, but the user wants a single paragraph. So, I'll have to write it in a flowing text, grouping similar information together.\n\nLet me start drafting the summary, making sure to include all the species and their specific locations, correct the term from \"province\" to \"autonomous region\", and resolve any minor contradictions. Check for any missing entities and ensure all are covered. Also, verify that the third-person perspective is maintained and that the entity names are included for context.\n"}}], "created": 1754459847, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2247, "prompt_tokens": 2736, "total_tokens": 4983, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 942, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
