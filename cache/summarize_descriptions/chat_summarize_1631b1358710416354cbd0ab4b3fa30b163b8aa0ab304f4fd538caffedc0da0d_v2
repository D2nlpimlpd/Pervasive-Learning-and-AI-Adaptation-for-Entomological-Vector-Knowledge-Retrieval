The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about the \"黑麻蝇属\" (which I think is Helicophagella). The data includes two descriptions. First, I need to make sure I understand both.\n\nThe first description says it's a genus in the Sarcophagidae family with a less developed phallosome structure. The second one gives the taxonomic name as Helicophagella Enderlein, 1928, and mentions the type species is Sarcophaga noverca Rondani, 1860. \n\nWait, the type species is listed as Sarcophaga noverca, but the genus is Helicophagella. That might be a point of confusion. In taxonomy, the type species is the species to which the genus is permanently linked. So if the genus is Helicophagella, the type species should be in that genus. But here, it's Sarcophaga noverca, which is in the genus Sarcophaga. That seems contradictory. Maybe there was a reclassification? The user mentioned if there are contradictions, resolve them. \n\nSo, the first description refers to the genus as 黑麻蝇属, which is the Chinese name. The second one gives the scientific name as Helicophagella Enderlein, 1928, and the type species as Sarcophaga noverca. But if the genus is now Helicophagella, the type species should be Helicophagella noverca, not Sarcophaga noverca. This suggests that the original classification was under Sarcophaga, but later it was moved to Helicophagella. Therefore, the correct type species would be Helicophagella noverca, with the original name being Sarcophaga noverca. \n\nI need to clarify that in the summary. Also, the first description mentions the phallosome structure. The phallosome is part of the male genitalia in flies, so a less developed one is a key morphological feature. \n\nPutting it all together: The genus 黑麻蝇属 (Helicophagella) was established by Enderlein in 1928, originally with Sarcophaga noverca as the type species, which was later reclassified under Helicophagella. The key characteristic is the less developed phallosome. \n\nI should make sure to mention both the Chinese and scientific names, the family (Sarcophagidae), the establishment details, the type species, and the morphological feature. Also, resolve the contradiction by explaining the reclassification. Keep it in third person and under 500 words.
