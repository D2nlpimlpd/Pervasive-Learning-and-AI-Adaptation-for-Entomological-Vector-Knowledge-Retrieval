It is home to a wide array of taxa, including *Robineauella (D.) walayari* in the Madras Province forests, *Pygophora respondens*, and *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina cuprina*. The country hosts multiple *Dichaetomyia* species such as *LUTEIVENTRIS*, *APICALIS*, *SETIFEMUR*, and *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, with type localities in regions like Darjeeling, Assam, and Kashmir. Notable species documented in India include *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, *Musca larvipara*, and *Musca crassirostris*, alongside *Muscina assimilis* and *Synthesiomyia nudiseta*. \n\nIndia is also a key location for *Sarcophaga* species, such as *Sarcophaga haematodes*, *Sarcophaga misera*, *Sarcophaga sericea*, and *Sarcophaga aegyptica*, as well as *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Argyrophylax phoeda*, and *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*. The genus *Adia* and species like *Atherigona kappa*, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Atherigona biseta*, *Bengalia* spp., *Bercaea cruentata*, *Borbororhina bivittata*, *Caricea boops*, *Cosmina bicolor*, *Cosmina limbipennis*, *Eudasyphora cyanicolor*, *Haematobia titillans*, *Haematobia minuta*, *Halydaia* and *Linnaemya* spp., *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, *Isomyia electa*, *Isomyia viridaurea*, *Isomyia nebulosa*, *Leucomyia cinerea* (eastern region), *Limnophora prominens*, *Limnophora fallax fallax*, *Limnophora albitarsis*, *Limnophora exigua*, *Limnophora himalayensis* (type locality), *Lispe sinica*, *Metalliopsis setosa*, *Paradichosia scutellata* (type locality Darjeeling), *Pegomya bicolor*, *Pegomya quadrivittata*, *Polietes orientalis* (northern regions), *Sturmiopsis inferens*, *Tainanina pilisquama*, *Ophyra chalcogaster*, *Stomoxys indicus* (type locality), and *Subhylemyia longula*. \n\nSpecific localities within India, such as Coimbatore (type locality for 612黄髭芒蝇), Assam (for 东方粪泉蝇 and 长板粪泉蝇), and the Khasi and Garo Hills, are highlighted for their role in species documentation. The southern region of India is noted for *Hydrotaea affinis*, while the northern regions host *Polietes orientalis*. Additionally, India is a type locality for *Brontaea lasiopa* and *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* (Kashmir), and it is associated with *Caiusa testacea* and ecological specimen collections. \n\nThe country also appears as a \"foreign location\" in the distribution of species like the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly (*Chlororhinia exempta* in Assam), *Sarcosolomonia crinita*, and *Stomorhina* spp., as well as in taxonomic keys for Sarcophagini. Internationally distributed species with Indian records include *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Drino inconspicua*, *Calythea setifrons*, and *Muscidae* subfamilies. Contradictory references to India as a \"foreign country\" are resolved by emphasizing its role as both a native and international distribution site for certain species. \n\nIn summary, India's biodiversity supports a rich assemblage of fly species, with many documented in specific regions or as type localities. Its ecological significance is underscored by the presence of both endemic and globally distributed taxa, making it a critical area for entomological research.

The user wants a comprehensive summary about India's role in the distribution of various fly species. First, I need to go through all the descriptions provided and make sure I don't miss any key points. There are a lot of species mentioned, so I should list them out to avoid repetition and ensure all are included.\n\nStarting with the first description: Robineauella (D.) walayari is in the Madras Province forests. Then Pygophora respondens in South Asia. Next, some fly species in general, and then Lucilia cuprina. There are several Musca species like Musca convexifrons, formosana, malaisei, craggi, seniorwhitei, larvipara, and crassirostris. Also, Sarcophaga haematodes and others like Thecocarcelia parnarae, Argyrophylax species, Dichaetomyia species (LUTEIVENTRIS, APICALIS, SETIFEMUR, quadrata), Cephalopina titillator, Parasarcophaga albiceps, and more.\n\nI notice some entries mention specific regions in India, like Darjeeling, Assam, Kashmir, Coimbatore, and the southern region. I should note those as type localities or specific areas where the species are found. Also, there are mentions of South Asia and international distribution, so I need to clarify that India is part of South Asia and some species have international presence.\n\nSome descriptions refer to India as a \"foreign location\" or \"abroad distribution,\" which might be a bit confusing. I need to resolve that by stating that while India is a South Asian country, certain species have distributions beyond its borders, including in India. Also, there are contradictions in the phrasing, like \"foreign country\" vs. \"country in South Asia.\" I should use \"country in South Asia\" consistently and mention that some species have international records.\n\nI should group the species by genus or family where possible to make the summary more organized. For example, multiple Musca species, several Dichaetomyia species, and different Sarcophaga species. Also, note the type localities for specific species like 612黄髭芒蝇 in Coimbatore, and others in Darjeeling, Assam, Kashmir.\n\nMake sure to mention the regions within India where these species are found, such as the northern, southern, and eastern regions. Also, include the fact that ecological specimens were collected in India for some species. The user wants the summary in third person, so avoid using \"I\" or \"we.\" Keep it concise, under 500 words, and ensure all entity names are included for context.\n\nCheck for any repeated information. For example, \"Country where the species is distributed\" appears multiple times, so I can generalize that without listing each instance. Also, some entries have Chinese names, like 612黄髭芒蝇 and 1397卡西亚麻蝇. I should include the Chinese names in parentheses if they are part of the original data.\n\nFinally, structure the summary by first introducing India as a South Asian country with diverse fly species, then list the genera and species with their specific regions and type localities. Conclude by mentioning the international aspects and the significance of India in entomological studies. Make sure the flow is logical and all data points are covered without contradictions.\n"}}], "created": 1754034110, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1696, "prompt_tokens": 1695, "total_tokens": 3391, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 708, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
