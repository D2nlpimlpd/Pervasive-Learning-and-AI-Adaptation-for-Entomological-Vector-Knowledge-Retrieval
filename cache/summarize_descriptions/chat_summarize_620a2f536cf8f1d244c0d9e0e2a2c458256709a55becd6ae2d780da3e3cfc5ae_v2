It is home to the species *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, as well as the genus *Burmanomyia*, whose name directly references Myanmar (\"缅\" meaning \"Myanmar\" in Chinese). The country hosts multiple species of the genus *Isomyia*, including *Isomyia isomyia*, *Isomyia electa*, and *Isomyia viridaurea*, and is a distribution site for *Limnophora prominens*, *Limnophora exigua*, and *Limnophora albitarsis* (specifically noted in the northeastern region). Additionally, Myanmar is documented as a location for *Alikangiella vittata*, *Anthomyia plumiseta*, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, *Egle minuta*, *Haematobiosa austeni*, *Megophyra simpliceps*, and *Paradichosia scutellata*.  \n\nThe country also supports the distribution of several *Musca* species, such as *Musca bezzii*, *Musca pilifacies*, *Musca tibetana*, and *Musca crassirostris*, which are noted to have foreign or international distribution records in Myanmar. Furthermore, Myanmar is associated with the genus *Hoa*, a group of flies, and the species *Sarcosolomonia crinita*, which is reported as a foreign distribution area. The Indian greenbottle fly (*Lucilia cuprina*), *Pegomya quadrivittata*, and *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* are also documented in the region.  \n\nNotably, Myanmar serves as the type locality for *Limnophora apiciseta*, a species within the Limnophora genus, and is part of the broader distribution range for other species. The Chinese name \"614裸蹠芒蝇\" (likely a local identifier for a species in the *Dichaetomyia* genus) and \"毛瓣家蝇\" (translated as \"hairy-palped housefly,\" corresponding to *Musca pilifacies* or *Musca tibetana*) are explicitly cited as foreign distribution areas. The species *Calythea setifrons* is also reported in Myanmar as an international region.  \n\nIn summary, Myanmar’s biodiversity includes a wide array of fly species, with notable presence in genera such as *Isomyia*, *Limnophora*, *Musca*, and *Dichaetomyia*. It functions as both a primary habitat and an international distribution point for these insects, underscoring its ecological importance in Southeast Asia. The country’s role as a type locality for certain species and its inclusion in the global range of others highlight its relevance in entomological studies. This compilation reflects Myanmar’s contribution to the geographic diversity of these taxa, though further research may clarify specific ecological interactions or regional variations.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of Myanmar based on the provided data, which lists various species found there. First, I need to parse all the descriptions and note the entities mentioned. The main entity is \"MYANMAR,\" and the descriptions are all about different species distributed in the country.\n\nI should start by identifying all the species and their distribution in Myanmar. The list includes several genera and species like Parasarcophaga albiceps, Burmanomyia, 614裸蹠芒蝇 (which I think is a Chinese name for a species, maybe Dichaetomyia?), SETIFEMUR DICHAETOMYIA, Limnophora prominens, Limnophora exigua, Limnophora albitarsis, Alikangiella vittata, Anthomyia plumiseta, Atherigona triglomerata, Dichaetomyia quadrata, Egle minuta, Isomyia isomyia, Isomyia electa, Isomyia viridaurea, Musca bezzii, Musca pilifacies, Musca tibetana, Myospila meditabunda angustifrons, Paradichosia scutellata, Pegomya quadrivittata, Indian greenbottle fly, Musca crassirostris, Sarcosolomonia crinita, Calythea setifrons, genus Hoa, and Haematobiosa austeni, Megophyra simpliceps.\n\nWait, some entries mention the same species in different ways. For example, \"SETIFEMUR DICHAETOMYIA\" and \"Dichaetomyia quadrata\" – maybe they are the same? Also, \"614裸蹠芒蝇\" is a Chinese name, so I need to check if it's a specific species. The user might not be a biologist, so I should use the Latin names where possible for clarity.\n\nNext, I need to organize these species into a coherent list. The user mentioned that if there are contradictions, I should resolve them. But looking at the data, all entries seem to agree that Myanmar is a distribution location for these species. The only possible issue is the Chinese name, which I should either translate or note as a local name. Since the user provided the Chinese name, maybe it's better to include it as is, but also mention the corresponding Latin name if known.\n\nAlso, some entries mention the country as a type locality, like Limnophora apiciseta. That's important to note. The user wants the summary in third person and to include entity names for context. I need to make sure not to use first or second person and to clearly state that Myanmar is the country in question.\n\nI should start the summary by stating Myanmar is a Southeast Asian country with a diverse range of species. Then list the species by genus or family, grouping them if possible. For example, multiple Limnophora species, Musca species, Isomyia species, etc. Also, mention the foreign distribution records for some species, which indicates that Myanmar is part of their international range.\n\nI need to check for any duplicates. For instance, \"Country where *Limnophora prominens* and *Limnophora exigua* are found\" and \"Myanmar is a country mentioned as the type locality for Limnophora apiciseta and part of the distribution for other species.\" So Limnophora has three species mentioned here. Similarly, Musca has several species.\n\nThe Chinese name \"614裸蹠芒蝇\" might be a specific species. Since I can't translate it directly, I'll include it as is but note that it's a local name. The same goes for \"毛瓣家蝇,\" which is the Indian greenbottle fly. I should mention both the Chinese name and the English translation if possible.\n\nI also need to ensure the summary is under 500 words. Let me count the words as I go. Start with a general statement about Myanmar's biodiversity, then list the species in categories. Make sure to mention the type locality for some species and the international distribution for others. Avoid repetition by combining similar entries.\n\nCheck for any contradictions. All entries seem to agree that Myanmar is a distribution location. The only thing to note is that some species are specifically mentioned in the northeastern region. I should include that detail where applicable.\n\nFinally, structure the summary logically: start with the country's location, then list the species by genus or family, mention the type locality, and note any international distribution aspects. Keep it concise but comprehensive, ensuring all provided data is included without exceeding the word limit.\n"}}], "created": 1754034552, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1617, "prompt_tokens": 659, "total_tokens": 2276, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 973, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
