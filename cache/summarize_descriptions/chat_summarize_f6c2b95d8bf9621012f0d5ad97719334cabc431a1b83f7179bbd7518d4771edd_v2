Commonly referred to as flesh flies, this family is characterized by distinct morphological and ecological traits. Members of Sarcophagidae are known for their larvae, which, in the subfamily Sarcophaginae, exhibit a specific anatomical feature: 12 or more short projections on the eighth abdominal segment. This detail is critical for taxonomic identification within the group. Additionally, the family is distinguished by the presence of long and slender anal cerci, a trait typical of adult Sarcophagidae. The combination of these features—larval abdominal projections and elongated anal cerci—helps differentiate Sarcophagidae from other fly families. The family’s placement within the Sarcophagoidea superfamily aligns with broader classifications in dipteran taxonomy, though its specific relationships may be further contextualized by the cited references.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about SARCOPHAGIDAE. First, I need to look at each description and extract the key points.\n\nThe first description mentions Sarcophagidae as a family of flies in the Sarcophagoidea superfamily, referencing figures A42 and A44 with some authors. The second one also states it's a family within Sarcophagoidea and adds that they are flesh flies. So I can combine these two, noting the superfamily and the common name \"flesh flies.\" The third description talks about the Sarcophaginae subfamily and the larvae's 12+ short projections on the eighth abdominal segment. The fourth one mentions anal cerci being long and slender. \n\nI need to make sure all these points are included. The user specified to resolve contradictions, but I don't see any here. All descriptions agree on the superfamily and the family name. The third one adds a subfamily detail, and the fourth gives a morphological feature. \n\nNow, structuring the summary. Start with the classification: family Sarcophagidae, superfamily Sarcophagoidea. Then mention they are flesh flies. Next, include the subfamily Sarcophaginae and the larval feature. Then the anal cerci detail. Also, note the references to the figures and authors. \n\nCheck for third person and entity names. Make sure it's concise, under 500 words. Avoid any markdown. Let me put it all together smoothly, ensuring each piece of information is connected logically. Maybe start with the general classification, then move to common name, subfamily specifics, and morphological traits. That should cover all the data points without repetition.\n"}}], "created": 1753954020, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 624, "prompt_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 916, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 368, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
