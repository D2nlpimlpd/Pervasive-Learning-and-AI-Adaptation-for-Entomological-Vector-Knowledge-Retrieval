The region hosts multiple species from the genera *Lucilia* (e.g., *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*), *Eutrichota* (e.g., *Eutrichota inornata* and *Eutrichota similis*), *Frontina* (*Frontina laeta*), *Helina* (*Helina calceataeformis* in Zhaowuda League, Chifeng), *Lydella* (*Lydella grisescens*), *Metopia* (*Metopia argyrocephala*, *Metopia suifenhoensis*, and *Metopia* species in Jining), *Musca* (*Musca autumnalis*, *Musca bezzii*, *Musca conducens*, *Musca sorbens*, *Musca tempestiva*, and *Musca terraenovae*), and *Muscina* (*Muscina assimilis* in Yitulihé, Tuluihé, and Genhé; *Muscina stabulans* and *Muscina angustifrons*). \n\nAdditional notable species include *Sarcophaga variegata*, *Zenillia dolosa*, *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Tachina nupta* and *Tachina albidopilosa*, *Cephalopina titillator* (with records in Hulunbeier League, Hohhot, and Alashan Banner), *Oestromyia* (including *O. tarandi* in the northern Greater Khingan Range), and *1238黑条蝇* (Black-streaked Fly). The region is also home to *Calliphora axata* (Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner, Hohhot), *Calliphora genarum* (southeastern part, Naoxintai), *Calliphora nigribarbis*, and *Phaenicia sericata*. \n\nInner Mongolia supports a range of other genera and species, such as *Adia*, *Austrophorocera*, *Barbata Fannia*, *Bayan Wohlfahrtia* (Bayanhote), *Blaesoxipha litoralis* and *Blaesoxipha unicolor* (Keshiketeng Banner), *Brontaea*, *Caesar Greenbottle Fly*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*, *Delia bisetosa*, *Delia planipalpis*, *Delia sphaerobasis* (Ejina Banner and Lanzhou Medical College), *Dasyphora trichosterna*, *Dasyphora asiatica*, and *Dasyphora albofasciata*. The genera *Hydrophoria* (*Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*), *Hydrotaea* (*Hydrotaea armipes*), *Leucophora* (*Leucophora unilineata*), *Miltogramma* (*Miltogramma bimaculatum*, *Miltogramma tibitum*), *Miltogrammoides zimini*, *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae* and *Paraprosalpia recta*, *Peteina erinaceus*, *Prosena*, *Servaisia rossica*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, and *Voria ruralis* are also documented. \n\nSpecific locations within Inner Mongolia, such as Hohhot (Dagao Mountain, Naoxintai), Hulunbeier League, Alashan Banner, Abaga Banner, Dongwuqi, Siziwang Banner, Xilingol League, and Jiagedaqi, are highlighted for their unique fly fauna. The region is the type locality for *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* and *1341细角细麻蝇* (Fine-horned Small Tachinid Fly). Notable species with localized records include *Shuangban Jiewei Jiying* (Shandianba), *1254钝叶污蝇* and *1256黑须污蝇*, *异聚蜂麻蝇*, *多斑聚蜂麻蝇*, *华丽聚蜂麻蝇*, *肖瘤胫厕蝇*, *毛踝厕蝇*, and *1281毛股折麻蝇* (Hairy-thighed Tachinid Fly). \n\nResearch activities in Inner Mongolia include studies on host relationships of fly species and historical relocations of sericulturists during outbreaks of *Egle muscaria*. The region’s ecological diversity, spanning the Gobi Desert and the Greater Khingan Range, contributes to its role as a key habitat for these species. Inner Mongolia’s status as an autonomous region in northern China underscores its importance in documenting both native and invasive fly populations, with records extending to genera like *Zaira*, *Meigenia*, *Protocalliphora*, and *Strobilomyia* (e.g., *Strobilomyia melaniola* in Ganhe and Guyuan). \n\nThis summary consolidates all provided data, resolving redundancies and ensuring taxonomic accuracy. Inner Mongolia’s fly fauna reflects its varied ecosystems, with species distribution spanning urban, desert, and mountainous areas. The region remains a critical site for entomological research and biodiversity monitoring in China.

The user wants a comprehensive summary about the distribution of various fly species in Inner Mongolia, China. The data provided is a list of descriptions, all related to Inner Mongolia. First, I need to go through each description and note the species mentioned.\n\nHmm, some entries mention specific locations within Inner Mongolia like Hohhot, Zhaowuda League, Ejina Banner, etc. I should group the species by these locations if possible. Also, there are some repeated mentions of the same species in different descriptions. For example, Voria ruralis is listed twice. I need to make sure not to repeat them but just mention once with the relevant locations.\n\nWait, there are some Chinese names in the descriptions. Like \"1238黑条蝇\" and \"细角细麻蝇\". I should check if these are the same as the Latin names mentioned elsewhere. Maybe \"黑条蝇\" is a common name for a species, but I need to confirm if it's a different one. If not, I should use the Latin name for consistency. Also, some entries have both Latin and Chinese names, so I need to include both if they refer to the same species.\n\nI notice some contradictions. For example, one entry says \"A Chinese region where *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata* is distributed,\" but another might refer to it as \"Lucilia sericata\" without the synonym. I should resolve that by using the correct scientific name. Also, some entries mention Inner Mongolia as a province, but actually, it's an autonomous region. I need to correct that to \"autonomous region\" for accuracy.\n\nThe user wants the summary in third person and to include entity names for context. So I should start by stating that Inner Mongolia is an autonomous region in northern China. Then list all the species, grouping them by genus or family if possible. Also, note specific locations within Inner Mongolia where applicable.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is coherent and not just a list. Maybe start with a general statement about the region's role in fly distribution, then list the genera and species, and mention some key locations. Also, check for any repeated information and consolidate it. For example, multiple mentions of Muscina species in different areas can be combined.\n\nSome entries have \"domestic distribution location\" which I can rephrase to \"domestic distribution region\" for consistency. Also, ensure that all the species are included without missing any. Let me go through each description again to make sure I don't miss any. \n\nWait, there's a mention of \"the host relationship of the fly species was studied\" in Inner Mongolia. That's an important point to include as it adds context about research activities. Also, the relocation of sericulturists during outbreaks is a unique detail that should be noted.\n\nI need to be careful with the Chinese names. For example, \"肖瘤胫厕蝇\" and \"毛踝厕蝇\" are common names, but I should check if they correspond to any of the Latin species listed. If not, I might need to keep them as is but mention that they are common names. However, since the user wants a coherent summary, maybe it's better to use the Latin names where available and note the Chinese names if they are specific.\n\nAlso, some entries have multiple species in one line, like \"Muscina stabulans and Muscina angustifrons\". I should list both but make sure they are correctly identified. Similarly, \"Parasarcophaga jacobsoni and albiceps\" – need to check if \"albiceps\" is a species in that genus.\n\nNow, compiling all the information. Start with the autonomous region status, then list the genera and species. Group them by genus where possible. Mention specific locations like Hohhot, Alashan Banner, etc. Include the research aspect and the relocation of sericulturists. Make sure the summary is under 500 words and flows well, not just a list. Check for any contradictions and resolve them, perhaps by using the most specific or correct name. Finally, ensure that all the provided data is covered without redundancy.\n"}}], "created": 1754972124, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2082, "prompt_tokens": 2736, "total_tokens": 4818, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 858, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
