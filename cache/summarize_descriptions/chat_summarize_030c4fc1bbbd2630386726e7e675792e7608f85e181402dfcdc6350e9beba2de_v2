It is home to *Robineauella (D.) walayari* in the Madras Province forests and serves as the type locality for 612黄髭芒蝇 (Coimbatore) and 1397卡西亚麻蝇. The country hosts multiple *Dichaetomyia* species, including *LUTEIVENTRIS*, *APICALIS*, *SETIFEMUR*, and *Dichaetomyia quadrata*, with some distributed internationally. Notable species documented in India include *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina cuprina*, *Sarcophaga haematodes*, *Thecocarcelia parnarae*, *Argyrophylax phoeda*, *Argyrophylax nigrotibialis*, *Caiusa testacea*, *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, *Musca larvipara*, *Musca crassirostris*, *Haematobia titillans*, *Haematobia minuta*, *Halydaia* and *Linnaemya* species, *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, *Isomyia electa*, *Isomyia viridaurea*, *Isomyia nebulosa*, *Leucomyia cinerea* (eastern region), *Limnophora albitarsis*, *Lispe sinica*, *Metalliopsis setosa*, *Borbororhinia bivittata*, *Paradichosia scutellata* (type locality: Darjeeling), *Pegomya bicolor*, *Pegomya quadrivittata*, *Polietes orientalis* (northern regions), *Sturmiopsis inferens*, *Tainanina pilisquama*, *Neomyia* species, *Stomoxys indicus* (type locality), *Subhylemyia longula*, *Ophyra chalcogaster*, *Hydrotaea affinis* (southern region), *Lixophaga parva*, *Muscina assimilis*, *Synthesiomyia nudiseta*, *613点芒蝇*, *紫翠蝇*, *绿翠蝇*, *东方粪泉蝇*, *长板粪泉蝇* (Assam), *Adia* genus (Assam, Khasi, and Garo Hills), *Scathophaga mellipes*, *Limnophora prominens*, *Limnophora exigua*, *Limnophora fallax fallax*, *Brontaea lasiopa* (type locality), *Chlororhinia exempta* (Assam), *Caricea boops*, *Cosmina bicolor*, *Cosmina limbipennis*, *Atherigona kappa*, *Atherigona tricolorifolia* (potential geographic subspecies), *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Atherigona biseta*, *Bengalia* species, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Borbororhina bivittata*, *Rhyncomya flavibasis*, *Drino inconspicua*, *Calythea setifrons*, *Muscidae* subfamilies, and *Sarcosolomonia crinita*. Additionally, India is a foreign distribution location for *Sarcophaga misera*, *Sarcophaga sericea*, *Sarcophaga aegyptica*, and *Stomorhina* genus species. The country's ecological diversity supports these flies, with specimens collected from regions like Darjeeling, Assam, Kashmir, and the southern areas. India's role as a type locality for several species, such as *Paradichosia scutellata* (Darjeeling) and *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* (Kashmir), underscores its importance in entomological taxonomy. The presence of both native and internationally distributed species highlights India's integration into global fly biodiversity patterns. Key genera like *Musca*, *Limnophora*, and *Dichaetomyia* are particularly well-represented, with some species (e.g., *Polietes orientalis*) noted in northern regions. The Indian greenbottle fly and the Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly are also documented, alongside ecological records for *Caiusa testacea*. Overall, India's varied habitats and geographic regions contribute to its status as a critical area for studying fly species distribution and taxonomy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle summarizing the data about India's distribution of various fly species. First, I need to go through all the descriptions provided and make sure I don't miss any key points. The user wants a comprehensive summary, so I have to combine all the information into one coherent paragraph.\n\nStarting with the entities, the main one is \"INDIA\". The descriptions mention a lot of different species, some with Chinese names like 612黄髭芒蝇 and 612点芒蝇, which I should probably translate or note as they are. Also, there are several mentions of type localities, like Coimbatore for 612黄髭芒蝇 and Darjeeling for Paradichosia scutellata. I need to include those specific locations where applicable.\n\nI notice some repeated mentions of Musca species, such as Musca convexifrons, Musca formosana, Musca malaisei, Musca craggi, Musca seniorwhitei, and Musca larvipara. Also, there's a mention of Musca crassirostris in both \"country associated\" and \"foreign distribution records\". I should check if these are the same or different entries. It seems like they are different, so I need to listMuscaspecies appropriately.\n\nThere are several references to Dichaetomyia species: LUTEIVENTRIS, APICALIS, SETIFEMUR, and Dichaetomyia quadrata. Also, the country is mentioned as having multiple Dichaetomyia species internationally. I should group these together to avoid repetition.\n\nSome entries mention regions within India like Assam, Darjeeling, Kashmir, Khasi, and Garo Hills. These are important for specifying where certain species are found. For example, Myospila meditabunda angustifrons has Kashmir as its type locality, and 1397卡西亚麻蝇 is distributed in a South Asian country with the type locality there. I need to make sure to note these regional specifics.\n\nThere are a few mentions of \"foreign country\" or \"abroad distribution location\". I need to clarify if these are referring to India as foreign in the context of other countries, but since the main entity is India, maybe it's just emphasizing that these species are found there as part of their international distribution. I'll keep that in mind and use terms like \"foreign distribution records\" or \"abroad\" as needed.\n\nI also see some contradictions or overlapping information. For example, \"Country where the species is distributed\" is mentioned multiple times. I should consolidate these into a general statement about various species being distributed in India. Similarly, some entries mention the same species in different ways, like \"Country where *Limnophora prominens* and *Limnophora exigua* are distributed\" and \"An international distribution location for Limnophora fallax fallax)|\\nAn international distribution location for Limnophora prominens)|\". I need to make sure to list all the Limnophora species mentioned without duplication.\n\nThe user wants the summary in third person and to include entity names for context. I should start by stating India is a country in South Asia and then list the species with their specific regions or type localities. Also, some entries have Chinese names, which I can include as they are, perhaps with the English translation if available, but since the user didn't provide translations, I'll keep them as is.\n\nI need to check for any conflicting information. For example, if a species is said to be in both northern and southern regions, I should note that. Also, some entries mention \"type locality\" for different species, which is important for taxonomic context. I should highlight those where specified.\n\nFinally, the summary should be under 500 words. I'll need to be concise but thorough, making sure all the species and regions are included without unnecessary repetition. I'll structure the summary by grouping similar species and regions, and mention the broader context of India's role in the distribution of these flies, including both domestic and international aspects.\n"}}], "created": 1754197380, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1851, "prompt_tokens": 1695, "total_tokens": 3546, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 844, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
