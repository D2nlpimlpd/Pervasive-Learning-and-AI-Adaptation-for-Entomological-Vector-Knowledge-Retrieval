In 1981, Qian and Fan co-established the subgenus *Apicamplexa* and described the species *Pierretia bihami*, *Bellardia sastylata*, and *Sinoprosa aertica*. They also co-authored the genus *HUO HUAYING SHU* in the same year. Additionally, Qian was involved in the description of *Hydrophoria longissima*, *Hydrophoria crassiforceps*, and *Hydrophoria pronata*, though the exact year for the latter two is unspecified. In 1984, Qian independently described the species *Delia sphaerobasis*. By 1988, Qian co-described *Leucophora brevifrons dasyprosterna* and contributed to the ecological habit data of a fly species in Xinjiang, China. Qian and Fan also collaborated on *Drymeia xinjiangensis*, published in *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, and *Eutrichota aertica*. Furthermore, Qian is credited as a co-author for *Pegomya crinilamella* and *E. hamata* and *E. quadrirecta*, the latter two being described alongside Fan. Notably, Qian is one of the scientists who described *Pyrellia habaheensis*, a species of fly associated with the Habahe region. Their work spans multiple genera and subgenera, including *Pierretia*, *Bellardia*, *Drymeia*, *Eutrichota*, *Leucophora*, and *Sinoprosa*, with a focus on entomological research in China. The descriptions often appear in academic journals such as *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, reflecting Qian’s role in advancing the classification of Diptera species. Collaborations with Fan are central to many of these contributions, particularly in the 1980s, while Qian also conducted independent research on species like *Delia sphaerobasis*. The ecological data provided for Xinjiang further underscores Qian’s engagement with regional biodiversity studies. Overall, Qian’s work demonstrates a multidisciplinary approach to entomology, combining taxonomic rigor with ecological insights.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about the entity \"QIAN\". First, I need to go through all the descriptions and see what they have in common and where they might conflict.\n\nLooking at the first few entries: Qian co-authored the description of Pierretia bihami in 1981 with Fan. Then there's a mention of co-establishing the subgenus Apicamplexa with Fan. Another one says Qian is associated with Hydrophoria longissima. Wait, there's also Hydrophoria crassiforceps and Hydrophoria pronata. So maybe Qian worked on multiple Hydrophoria species? Also, the genus HUO HUAYING SHU was co-authored with Fan in 1981. \n\nThen there's Delia sphaerobasis described in 1984, and Bellardia sastylata in 1981. Drymeia xinjiangensis in Acta Entomologica Sinica. Eutrichota aertica Qian et Fan. Pegomya crinilamella. Leucophora brevifrons dasyprosterna in 1988. Sinoprosa aertaica in 1981. And the Chinese entry about Pyrellia habaheensis. \n\nI need to check for contradictions. For example, the first description says Qian described Pierretia bihami in 1981 with Fan, and another mentions co-establishing Apicamplexa with Fan. Are these the same work? Maybe. Also, the Delia sphaerobasis is mentioned twice, once without a year and once with 1984. The user probably wants the most specific info, so I'll use 1984. \n\nThe Hydrophoria longissima and Hydrophoria crassiforceps/pronata are separate, so Qian worked on multiple species in that genus. The Sinoprosa aertaica is in Chinese, so I need to make sure to include that. \n\nI should structure the summary by entity, grouping the works by year and genus. Start with the co-establishment of Apicamplexa in 1981 with Fan. Then list the species described in 1981, like Pierretia bihami, HUO HUAYING SHU, Bellardia sastylata, Eutrichota aertica, and Sinoprosa aertaica. Then mention the 1984 Delia sphaerobasis. Hydrophoria species in 1981 and 1988. Also, the ecological data in Xinjiang. \n\nMake sure to use third person and include all entity names. Check for any conflicting years or species. The user mentioned to resolve contradictions, so if there's a discrepancy in the year for Delia sphaerobasis, I'll go with the 1984 one. Also, the Chinese name for Pyrellia habaheensis should be translated or kept as is? The user probably wants the Latin name, so I'll note it as Pyrellia habaheensis. \n\nPutting it all together, start with Qian's collaborations with Fan, then list the species and subgenus by year. Mention the ecological data contribution. Ensure all species are included and the years are accurate. Keep it under 500 words. Let me check the word count as I go. \n\nWait, the last entry says \"Qian 是描述哈巴河碧蝇 (Pyrellia habaheensis) 的科学家之一。\" So that's another species, Pyrellia habaheensis, described in Chinese. Need to include that. Also, the subgenus Apicamplexa is mentioned twice, so just note that once. \n\nI think that's all. Now, structure the summary chronologically and by genus, making sure to mention all the species and the subgenus. Also, include the ecological data part. Let me start drafting.\n"}}], "created": 1754033224, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1381, "prompt_tokens": 490, "total_tokens": 1871, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 859, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
