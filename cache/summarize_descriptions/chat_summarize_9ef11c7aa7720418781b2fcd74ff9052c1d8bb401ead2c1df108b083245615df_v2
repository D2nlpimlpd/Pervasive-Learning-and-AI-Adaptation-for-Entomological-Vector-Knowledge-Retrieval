It is recognized as a sub-tribe within the larger Protodexiini tribe, which itself belongs to the family Tachinidae, a group of parasitoid flies. The Servaisiini tribe is specifically characterized by the inclusion of the genus *Servaisia*, which is its primary constituent. Roback’s original description in 1954 formalized the tribe’s classification, positioning it within the Protodexiini framework to reflect its evolutionary and morphological relationships with other related genera. The tribe’s hierarchical placement underscores its role in the broader taxonomy of Tachinidae, where Protodexiini serves as a higher-level grouping for certain parasitoid fly lineages. While the descriptions provided emphasize both the tribe’s establishment and its taxonomic context, the key detail is that Servaisiini is a distinct sub-tribe within Protodexiini, defined by the presence of *Servaisia* and its associated species. This classification highlights the systematic work of Roback in organizing the diversity of tachinid flies, particularly those with ecological or morphological traits aligning them with the Protodexiini lineage. The tribe’s nomenclature and structure remain consistent with the 1954 proposal, though further taxonomic revisions or additions to the tribe may have occurred in subsequent studies. Overall, Servaisiini represents a specialized grouping within the Tachinidae family, reflecting both historical taxonomic efforts and the phylogenetic relationships of its member genera.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the entity \"SERVAISIINI\" based on the provided descriptions. The first step is to look at the two descriptions given. \n\nThe first one says it's a tribe of flies established by Roback in 1954, containing the genus Servaisia. The second mentions it's a tribe within Protodexiini, also described by Roback in the same year. Hmm, so both agree on the tribe name, the author, and the year. The difference is the first mentions the genus Servaisia, while the second places it within Protodexiini. \n\nWait, Protodexiini is another tribe, right? So maybe the first description is a bit incomplete. The second one adds that Servaisiini is a tribe within Protodexiini. That makes sense because in taxonomy, a tribe can be part of a larger tribe. So the key points are: tribe name, author (Roback), year (1954), and the genus it contains (Servaisia). Also, the hierarchical placement within Protodexiini.\n\nI need to make sure the summary includes all these elements. The user mentioned if there are contradictions, resolve them. Here, the two descriptions don't contradict each other; they just provide different aspects. The first gives the tribe's content (genus Servaisia), the second its placement (within Protodexiini). So combining them should be straightforward.\n\nNow, structure the summary. Start with the tribe name, author, year. Then mention it's part of Protodexiini. Include the genus Servaisia. Use third person and keep it concise under 500 words. Let me check the example output to see the style. It's a single paragraph, mentions both the tribe and the genus, and the hierarchical placement. \n\nI should also verify if Protodexiini is a valid higher-level tribe. Since the user provided that, I can include it. Make sure the summary is coherent and flows well. Avoid any technical jargon that's unnecessary. Just present the facts clearly. Alright, putting it all together now.\n"}}], "created": 1754105893, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 792, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 978, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 454, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
