The district serves as a documented habitat for *Musca crassirostris*, a species whose ecological presence is tied to regions like Songjiang, highlighting its role in the broader environmental context of the area. Similarly, *Stomorhina obsoleta*, another species, is explicitly noted to occur in Songjiang, further underscoring the district's biodiversity relevance. The third description, which states \"Songjiang is a district in Shanghai where the species is found,\" aligns with the first two but is less specific, likely referring to both *Musca crassirostris* and *Stomorhina obsoleta* collectively.  \n\nNo contradictions exist among the descriptions, as all consistently identify Songjiang as a district in Shanghai and link it to the presence of these species. The summary integrates the information to emphasize Songjiang's dual role in the habitats of *Musca crassirostris* and *Stomorhina obsoleta*, while maintaining clarity and coherence. The district’s inclusion in the distribution of both species reflects its ecological importance within the region, though further details about the species’ interactions or specific environmental conditions in Songjiang are not provided in the data. The descriptions collectively establish Songjiang as a key location for these species in Shanghai, contributing to the understanding of their geographic spread.  \n\nThis concise overview ensures all provided data points are addressed, with the entity names (Songjiang, *Musca crassirostris*, *Stomorhina obsoleta*) included for full context.

The user wants me to generate a comprehensive summary for the entity \"SONGJIAN\" based on the provided descriptions. The entities are all related to the same place, which is a district in Shanghai, China. The descriptions mention that it's part of the distribution area for two species: Musca crassirostris and Stomorhina obsoleta. Also, there's a third description that just says \"Songjiang is a district in Shanghai where the species is found.\" \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the entities correctly. \"SONGJIAN\" is likely referring to Songjiang District in Shanghai. The user probably wants the summary to include all the information from the descriptions. The key points here are that Songjiang is a district in Shanghai, and it's associated with the distribution of these two species. \n\nWait, the third description just says \"the species is found\" without specifying which one. But the first two descriptions mention Musca crassirostris and Stomorhina obsoleta. So maybe the third one is a general statement that includes both? I should check if there's any contradiction. The first two descriptions are about different species, but they both point to Songjiang as part of their distribution. The third one is a bit vague but probably refers to both. \n\nI need to combine all these into a single, coherent summary. The user wants it in third person and to include the entity names. Also, the final summary should be under 500 words. Let me start by stating that Songjiang is a district in Shanghai, China. Then mention that it's part of the distribution for both Musca crassirostris and Stomorhina obsoleta. The third description is a bit redundant but can be used to reinforce that the district is a location where these species are found. \n\nI should make sure the names are correctly capitalized. The first two descriptions have the species names in italics, but since the user didn't specify formatting, maybe just use the names as given. Also, check if there's any conflicting information. All descriptions agree on the location being a district in Shanghai, so no contradictions there. \n\nPutting it all together: Songjiang District in Shanghai, China, is noted for being part of the distribution range of two species, Musca crassirostris and Stomorhina obsoleta. The third description is a general statement that aligns with the first two. I need to present this clearly, making sure to mention both species and the district's location. Keep it concise but comprehensive.
