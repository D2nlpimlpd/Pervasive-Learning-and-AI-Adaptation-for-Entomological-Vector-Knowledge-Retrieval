This taxonomic group includes the family Sarcophagidae, commonly known as flesh flies, which are notable for their larvae that exhibit specific feeding habits, such as consuming decaying flesh, animal waste, or other organic matter. The superfamily is referenced in figures A37-A39 and A42, drawing from the works of van Emden (1954) and Rohdendorf (1930–1935), who described its morphological and ecological traits. Sarcophagoidea plays a significant role in forensic entomology due to the carrion-feeding behavior of its larvae, which aids in decomposition processes and can provide insights into postmortem intervals. The inclusion of flesh flies within this superfamily highlights its ecological and taxonomic importance in the study of Diptera.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about SARCOPHAGOIDEA. The entities given are \"SARCOPHAGOIDEA\" and the descriptions mention it's a superfamily of flies with a developed postscutellum and specific larval feeding habits, and also that it's within the Calyptratae containing flesh flies.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the key points. The superfamily Sarcophagoidea is part of the Calyptratae, which is a subsection of flies. The first description mentions morphological features like the postscutellum and larval habits, while the second adds that they're flesh flies. I should combine these into a single, coherent summary.\n\nWait, the first description references figures A37-A39 and A42, and the authors van Emden and Rohdendorf. I need to include those references properly. Also, the user mentioned if there are contradictions, resolve them. But in this case, both descriptions seem to complement each other. The postscutellum is a morphological feature, and the Calyptratae classification is a taxonomic one. Flesh flies are the common name for the family Sarcophagidae, which is part of this superfamily. So no contradictions here, just combining the info.\n\nI should start by stating the superfamily's classification, then mention the key characteristics. The postscutellum is a part of the thorax in flies, so that's a structural detail. The larval feeding habits are specific, but the second description says they're flesh flies, which are known for their larvae feeding on decaying flesh or other organic matter. Maybe the first description is more about the larval habits in general, and the second specifies the type of flesh flies. Need to clarify that.\n\nAlso, the references are in Chinese characters for the years. The first one is 仿van Emden, 1954; 仿Rohdendorf, 1930-1935. The \"仿\" might mean \"based on\" or \"following,\" so I should note that the descriptions are based on those works. But the user probably wants the summary to just include the references as given, maybe in parentheses.\n\nThird person is important. Use \"is\" instead of \"are\" if the superfamily is singular. Also, include the entity name in the summary. Keep it under 500 words. Let me check the example output. It starts with \"Sarcophagoidea is a superfamily...\" and combines both descriptions, mentioning the Calyptratae, postscutellum, larval habits, and references. The user example also uses \"including\" to list the families, but the original data doesn't mention families. Wait, the original data only mentions the superfamily and the family Sarcophagidae (flesh flies). So maybe I should just say it contains the family Sarcophagidae, which includes flesh flies.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is accurate and includes all the given information. Let me structure it: start with the taxonomic classification, mention the morphological feature (postscutellum), the larval feeding habits, and the inclusion of flesh flies. Then add the references as per the first description. Also, note that the postscutellum is a key characteristic, and the larval habits are specific. Since the user provided two descriptions, I need to merge them without redundancy. Check for any possible contradictions. The first says \"specific larval feeding habits,\" the second says \"flesh flies.\" Flesh flies are known for their larvae feeding on carrion, so that's a specific habit. So the summary can state that the larvae have specific feeding habits, such as those of flesh flies. That connects both points.\n\nMake sure to mention the figures A37-A39 and A42 as referenced. Also, the authors are van Emden and Rohdendorf, with the years 1954 and 1930-1935. The user example uses \"as described in figures A37-A39 and A42 (based on van Emden, 1954; Rohdendorf, 1930-1935).\" So I can follow that format.\n\nPutting it all together: Sarcophagoidea is a superfamily in the Calyptratae, characterized by a developed postscutellum and specific larval feeding habits, including those of flesh flies. The references are included as per the first description. The summary should be concise, third person, and under 500 words. Let me check the word count. The example output is 100 words, so I need to keep it similar. Avoid technical jargon unless necessary. Make sure it's a single, coherent paragraph. Alright, that should cover it.\n"}}], "created": 1753954035, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1261, "prompt_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 1500, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 1036, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
