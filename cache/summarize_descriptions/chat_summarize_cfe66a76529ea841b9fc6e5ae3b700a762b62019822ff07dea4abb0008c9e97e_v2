The province hosts a wide array of documented taxa, including **Mesembrina** species, **Argyrophylax laticornis**, and **Atherigona** species such as *Atherigona reversura*, *A. oryzae*, and *A. yiwulushan*. It is also home to **Iranihindia spinosa**, **Metopia auripulvera**, **Musca convexifrons** (found in Kunming and Xishuangbanna), and **Musca malaisei**, *M. craggi*, and *M. seniorwhitei*. Specific locations within Yunnan, like **Deqin** and **Weixi**, are noted for **Pogonomyia** species, while **Lijiang Dayanzhen** is the type locality for **FAN'S SARCOPHAGA**.  \n\nThe province is associated with multiple **Isomyia** species, including *I. divisa*, *I. mandarina*, and *I. tripartita*, as well as **Polleniopsis** species such as *P. yunnanensis* and *P. deqingensis*. **Syngamoptera angustifrons** is documented in Yunnan with its type locality in **Yongshan**, and **Servillia planiforceps** is also present. Notable genera and species include **Calliphora axata** (Zhongxun), *C. rohdendorfi*, and *C. chinghaiensis* (Zhongdian); **Paradichosia scutellata** and **Kangding Variant Beauty Fly Paradichosia kangdingensis**; **Lucilia (Luciliella) sinensis**; and **Sarcorohdendorfia seniorwhitei** and *S. antilope*.  \n\nYunnan’s regions like **Xishuangbanna**, **Lancang**, **Jianshui**, and **Nujiang River Valley** are highlighted for species such as **Graphomya rufitibia**, **THICK RING BLACK FLY**, **Bengalia (Ochromyia) escheri**, **Delia bracata**, **Drino facialis**, and **Chrysomya** species (*C. pinguis*, *C. megacephala*, *C. bezziana*). The **Dehong Sugarcane Experiment Station** in Yunnan has been central to studying the host species of **Sturmiopsis inferens**, while **Lugu Lake** and **Kunming** are linked to **Bellardia curviloba**, *B. micromenechma*, and *B. notomenechma*.  \n\nAdditional species documented in Yunnan include **Meliniella spatuliforceps** (type locality in Ruili Mengxiu), **Peribaea orbata**, **Polietes orientalis** (Deqin), **Xenotachina pulchellifrons**, **Drymeia midtibia** and *D. grapsopoda*, **Eudasyphora cyanicolor**, **Lispe odessae**, **Gymnadichosia pusilla**, **Helina hirtifemorata** (Jizushan, Bichuan), **Brontaea tonitrui**, *B. lasiopa*, and *B. yunnanensis*. The province also supports **Metoposisyrops scirpophagae**, **Periscepsia carbonaria**, **Austrophorocera**, **Kanomyia bangkokensis**, **Nemoraea pellucida**, **Carcelia matsukarehae**, *C. ambigua*, and *C. kockiana* (hosting *Heliothis armigera*).  \n\nYunnan’s diverse ecosystems, including **Luku**, **Ruili**, **Jingdong**, and **Mengding**, are critical for species like **1340杯细麻蝇**, **1354 Tail Pierretia Fly**, **1393义乌亚麻蝇**, and **1397卡西亚麻蝇**. The province is further noted for **Parasarcophaga brevicornis** and *P. macroauriculata*, **Chlororhinia exempta**, **Haematobia**, **Vibrissina Rondani**, **Morellia hainanensis**, and **Neomyia** species in Mengding, Gengma, Dushu Jiao, and Mengla.  \n\nWith sublocations such as **Xishuangbanna**, **Deqin Meili Xueshan**, and **Lushui Yaojiaping**, Yunnan exemplifies a hotspot for entomological research, supported by institutions like the **Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing**. Its documented fly fauna underscores its ecological importance in China’s biodiversity.

The user wants a comprehensive summary about Yunnan, a Chinese province, focusing on the distribution of various fly species. The data provided is a list of descriptions, some in English, some in Chinese, and a few with specific locations and species names.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand all the entities mentioned. Yunnan is the main entity here, and all the descriptions are about it. The challenge is to combine all these into a single, coherent summary without contradictions. The user also mentioned that if there are contradictions, I should resolve them. But looking through the data, it seems all the descriptions are consistent in stating that Yunnan is a Chinese province with various fly species distributed there. So maybe no contradictions, just a lot of information to consolidate.\n\nI notice that some entries mention specific cities or regions within Yunnan, like Kunming, Xishuangbanna, Deqin, Weixi, etc. I should include these to add geographical context. Also, there are multiple species listed, both in English and Chinese. For example, \"Mesembrina species,\" \"Argyrophylax laticornis,\" \"Atherigona reversura,\" and others. I need to list these in a way that's organized, perhaps grouping similar genera or species together.\n\nThe user wants the summary in third person and to include entity names for full context. So I should start by stating Yunnan is a Chinese province, then mention the various fly species and their distribution within the province. I should also note the specific locations where these species are found, as that adds detail. \n\nI need to check for any repeated mentions of the same species or genus. For example, \"Musca\" is mentioned several times with different species. I should group those under the Musca genus. Similarly, \"Isomyia\" and \"Polleniopsis\" have multiple entries. Also, some entries have Chinese names, like \"611扁蹠芒蝇\" and \"范氏细麻蝇.\" I should include both the Chinese and English names if available, but if not, just the Chinese name is okay.\n\nThe final summary should be under 500 words. I need to be concise but thorough. Let me start by listing all the species and their locations, then structure the summary by genus or by regions. Maybe start with a general statement about Yunnan's biodiversity, then go into specific genera and species, mentioning the cities and areas where they are found. Also, note any type localities, as that's important for taxonomy.\n\nWait, some entries mention \"type locality,\" like \"Lijiang Dayanzhen\" for FAN'S SARCOPHAGA and \"Yongshan\" for Syngamoptera angustifrons. These should be highlighted as they indicate where the species was first described. Also, the Institute of Parasitic Diseases in Nanjing is mentioned in one entry, so that's a relevant institution to note.\n\nI should also check if all the species are correctly attributed to Yunnan. For example, \"中国云南是中缅璃蝇的国内分布地\" translates to \"China Yunnan is the domestic distribution site of the Sino-Burmese glass fly.\" So I need to make sure to include that in the summary.\n\nNow, compiling all the information. Start with Yunnan as a Chinese province known for diverse fly species. Then list the genera and species, grouping them where possible. Mention specific locations like Kunming, Xishuangbanna, Deqin, etc. Include the type localities and any institutions involved in studies. Make sure to use both English and Chinese names where applicable, and avoid repetition by consolidating similar entries.\n\nI need to ensure that the summary flows well, perhaps starting with the most frequently mentioned genera, like Musca, Isomyia, Polleniopsis, and then moving to others. Also, note that some entries mention multiple species under the same genus, so grouping them would make the summary more efficient.\n\nCheck for any possible contradictions. For example, if a species is mentioned in two different locations within Yunnan, that's not a contradiction but just additional info. All entries seem to support the same main point: Yunnan has a wide range of fly species distributed across various regions.\n\nFinally, make sure the summary is in third person, uses the entity name \"Yunnan\" consistently, and stays within the word limit. Let me start drafting the summary, ensuring all key points are covered and the information is presented coherently.\n"}}], "created": 1754890042, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2027, "prompt_tokens": 2862, "total_tokens": 4889, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 939, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
