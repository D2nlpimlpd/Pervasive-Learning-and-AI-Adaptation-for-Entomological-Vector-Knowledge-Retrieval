All four species (*Bellardia curviloba*, *Bellardia micromenechma*, *Bellardia notomenechma*, and *Carcelia lymantriae*) were formally documented in 1986, underscoring LIANG's active involvement in entomological or botanical classification during this period.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the entity \"LIANG\" based on the provided descriptions. First, I need to look at each description carefully.\n\nThe first description says LIANG described Bellardia curviloba with Gan in 1986. The second one mentions Carcelia lymantriae in 1986. The third states that LIANG was a co-author for two Bellardia species in the same year. \n\nWait, the third description lists Bellardia micromenechma and Bellardia notomenechma, both from 1986. So, LIANG worked with others on these. The first two descriptions also mention 1986, so all these works are from the same year. \n\nI need to make sure the summary includes all three species and their co-authors. The user mentioned resolving contradictions if any. Here, all the dates are 1986, so no conflict there. The key is to note that LIANG was a co-author on the first and third, and the sole author on the second? Wait, no. The first description says \"with Gan,\" so LIANG and Gan co-authored Bellardia curviloba. The third says co-author of the other two Bellardia species. The second is Carcelia lymantriae, which is a different genus. \n\nSo, the summary should mention that in 1986, LIANG described three species: two in the Bellardia genus (curviloba with Gan, and micromenechma and notomenechma as co-author) and one in Carcelia (lymantriae). Need to clarify the co-authorship for each. \n\nAlso, the user wants the summary in third person and include entity names. The final length should be under 500 words. Let me structure it by listing each species with their co-authors and the year. Make sure to note that all are from 1986. Check for any possible contradictions. Since all are from the same year, no issues there. \n\nSo, the summary would start by stating that LIANG is an author who described three species in 1986. Then list each species with their respective co-authors. For the Bellardia species, two are co-authored with others (maybe the same person or different ones?), but the third description only mentions co-authorship without a name. Wait, the third description says \"Co-author of Bellardia micromenechma (1986) and Bellardia notomenechma (1986)\". It doesn't specify who the co-authors were. The first one was with Gan, the second one (Carcelia) is solo? Or is there a missing co-author? The data doesn't mention a co-author for Carcelia lymantriae, so maybe LIANG was the sole author there. \n\nSo, the summary should be: In 1986, LIANG described three species. Bellardia curviloba was co-authored with Gan. Carcelia lymantriae was described by LIANG alone. Then, LIANG was a co-author for Bellardia micromenechma and Bellardia notomenechma, but the co-authors for those aren't specified. Wait, the third description says \"Co-author of Bellardia micromenechma (1986) and Bellardia notomenechma (1986)\". So, LIANG was a co-author on those two, but the other co-authors aren't named here. The first one was with Gan, but the third ones don't mention Gan. So maybe different co-authors for the other two Bellardia species. \n\nBut the user's data doesn't provide the names of the other co-authors for micromenechma and notomenechma. So in the summary, I can only mention that LIANG was a co-author on those two, without specifying others. The first one was with Gan, the second (Carcelia) is solo, and the third two Bellardia species are co-authored but the other authors aren't named. \n\nI need to present this clearly. Start by stating the year and the three species. For each, note the co-authors if available. Since the third description doesn't mention co-authors for the other two Bellardia species, just say \"as a co-author\" without names. \n\nCheck for coherence. All species are from 1986, so the summary should reflect that. Make sure the entity name is included each time. Avoid contradictions by not assuming any missing information. \n\nNow, write the summary in third person, concise, under 500 words. Let me draft it:\n\n\"LIANG is an author who described three species in 1986. In collaboration with Gan, they described the species Bellardia curviloba. Additionally, LIANG was a co-author in the description of Bellardia micromenechma and Bellardia notomenechma, both published in the same year. Separately, LIANG also described the species Carcelia lymantriae in 1986. These contributions highlight LIANG's role in taxonomic work within the genera Bellardia and Carcelia during that year.\"\n\nWait, the third description says \"Co-author of Bellardia micromenechma (1986) and Bellardia notomenechma (1986)\", but the first one was with Gan. The second one (Carcelia) is solo. So the summary should mention that for the first Bellardia species, the co-author is Gan, and for the other two Bellardia species, LIANG was a co-author (without specifying others). The Carcelia one is solo. \n\nYes, that's correct. The user didn't provide the other co-authors for micromenechma and notomenechma, so we can't name them. Just state that LIANG was a co-author. \n\nCheck the word count. The example output is 100 words. The user wants up to 500, so this is fine. Make sure it's all in third person and includes the entity names. \n\nLooks good. No contradictions. All info is included. That should be the summary.\n"}}], "created": 1754105568, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1641, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 1855, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 1343, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
