It is characterized by distinct T-shaped black median stripes on the abdominal tergites, a feature that distinguishes it from other members of its genus. The fly also possesses a white alula, a small lobe on the hind leg, which further aids in identification. Morphologically, it has a body length of approximately 4 mm, as noted in taxonomic records. \n\nThe species is distributed in two primary regions: domestically in Shanxi Province, China, specifically in the city of Taiyuan, and internationally in the Alps of Europe, where it was first identified as the type locality. These geographic ranges suggest a possible adaptation to temperate and alpine environments, though specific ecological preferences remain undocumented in the provided data. \n\nBoth descriptions confirm the T-shaped black stripes on abdominal segments (tergites) and the presence of a white alula as defining traits. The first description adds the body length of 4 mm, while the second emphasizes the distribution in Shanxi and the Alps. No contradictions exist between the two sources, as they align on key morphological and geographic details.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided for \"LEUCOPHORA DORSALIS\". They mentioned that if there are contradictions, I should resolve them and keep it under 500 words in third person.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the two descriptions given. Both mention the species was described by Stein in 1916. The first one adds \"T-shaped black median stripes on abdominal tergites\" and a \"white alula\", while the second says \"T-shaped black median stripes on abdominal segments\". The second description also mentions the same distribution: Shanxi (Taiyuan) and Europe (Alps). The first one specifies the body length as 4 mm, which the second doesn't include. \n\nWait, \"abdominal tergites\" vs. \"abdominal segments\"—are those the same thing? Tergites are the dorsal plates of the abdomen in arthropods, so maybe the second is more general. I should check if they refer to the same feature. Since both are from the same entity, I can probably combine them, using the more specific term \"tergites\" from the first description. \n\nThe second description says \"distribution in Shanxi (Taiyuan) and Europe (Alps)\", while the first specifies \"domestically\" and \"internationally\". The user probably wants to clarify that Shanxi is in China, so I should note that. Also, the type locality is the Alps in Europe, which is important for taxonomic information. \n\nThe body length is only mentioned in the first description. I need to include that. The second one doesn't have it, so I can add it as a separate detail. \n\nNow, I need to make sure the summary is in third person and includes the entity name. Let me start by stating the species and the description by Stein in 1916. Then mention the key characteristics: T-shaped black stripes on abdominal tergites and a white alula. \n\nFor distribution, I'll note both Shanxi (Taiyuan, China) and the Alps in Europe, specifying that the Alps are the type locality. The body length is 4 mm. \n\nI should check for any contradictions. Both descriptions agree on the stripes and distribution. The first is more detailed with the alula and body length. No conflicts here. \n\nPutting it all together: Start with the species name, author, year. Then physical characteristics, distribution, and body length. Make sure to mention the type locality. Keep it concise but include all the details. \n\nLet me structure it. First sentence: Leucophora dorsalis is a species of fly described by Stein in 1916. Then the distinguishing features. Then distribution, noting the type locality. Finally, the body length. \n\nI need to ensure that the terms are consistent. Use \"abdominal tergites\" as it's more specific. Also, clarify that the white alula is a distinguishing feature. \n\nCheck the word count. The example output is 100 words, so I need to stay under 500. This should be manageable. \n\nMake sure to use third person and avoid any markdown. Just plain text. Alright, let's draft the summary.\n"}}], "created": 1754035346, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 952, "prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 1217, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 678, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
