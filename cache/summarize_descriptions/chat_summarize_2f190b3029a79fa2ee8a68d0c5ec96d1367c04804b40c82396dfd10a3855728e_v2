It is home to a diverse array of dipteran insects, including parasitic and non-parasitic species, with records spanning multiple genera and families. The province is particularly notable for its role in the 1960s outbreaks of *柞蚕饰腹寄蝇* (LIAONING-associated species), a parasitic fly linked to柞蚕 (silkworm) cultivation. Specific species documented in Liaoning include *Mesembrina*, *Buquetia musca*, *Xylotachina diluta*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Muscina japonica*, *Muscina stabulans*, *Muscina angustifrons*, *Platymyia hortulana*, *Platymyia mitis*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni*, *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Tachina nupta*, *Servillia ardens*, *Helina parcepilosa*, *Helina quadrum*, *Helina ciliata*, *Limnophora triangula*, *Nupedia linotaenia* (Jianshang Daheishan), and the Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly. \n\nLiaoning hosts multiple *Phaonia* species, such as *Phaonia beizhenensis*, *Phaonia iwurhuishanensis*, *Phaonia longifurca*, *Phaonia fuscata*, *Phaonia changbaishanensis*, and *Phaonia huanrenensis*, with Qianshan as the holotype locality for *Phaonia mimofausta*. The province is also a distribution site for *Lispe tentaculata*, *Lispe consanguinea*, and *Lispe* species like *Lispe nudiseta* (Dalian). Notable localities within Liaoning include Shenyang, where *Graphomya rufitibia*, *Phaonia fissa*, *Fannia scalaris*, and *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) jacobsoni* are found; Benxi, associated with *Helina unistriata* (Xiuquan Qingshan), *Helina latitarsis*, *Lasiomma octoguttatum*, and *Bellardia benshiensis*; and Fengcheng, where *Calliphora axata* occurs. \n\nAdditional species recorded in Liaoning include *Acklandia curvata*, *Acrostilpna montana*, *Bessa* genus, *Takanoa* genus, *Hoa* genus, *Liaoning Bellardia*, *类绒粪泉蝇* (Jianchang Heishan, Jinzhou), *圆斑莠蝇*, *胸刺厕蝇*, *1278靴折麻蝇*, *1280钩阳折麻蝇*, *1339上海细麻蝇*, *1395巨亚麻蝇*, *1396犁头亚麻蝇*, and *HEYUAN HUI FLY* (732). The province is also linked to the genera *Carcelia* (e.g., *Carcelia matsukarehae*, *Carcelia ambigua*, *Carcelia excisa*), *Gymnadichosia pusilla*, *Brontaea nigrogrisea*, *Syllegopterula flava*, *Syngamoptera amurensis*, *Parasarcophaga polystylata*, and *Paraprosalpia qinghoensis*. \n\nLiaoning’s biodiversity is further highlighted by the presence of *Compsilura concinnata*, *Fannia kowarzi*, *Hebecnema alba*, *KENT'S SARCOPHAGA*, *Mydaea breviscutellata*, *Mydaea tinctoscutaris* (type locality in Benxi), *PIERRETTIA SICHOTEALINI*, *PIERRETTIA CLATHRATA*, and *Parasarcophaga brevicornis*. The province supports multiple *Limnophora*, *Lasiomma*, and *Lispe* species, as well as *Muscina assimilis* in Shenyang, Liaoyang, Xinbin, Huanren, and Fushun, and *Synthesiomyia nudiseta* in Dalian. \n\nInstitutions like the Liaoning Provincial Health and Epidemic Prevention Station in Benxi play a role in preserving specimens of these species. The province’s ecological significance is underscored by its inclusion in studies of parasitic interactions, such as *Austrophorocera* parasitizing the Poplar Defoliator, and its historical association with柞蚕 (silkworm) parasitism. With over 50 distinct species and genera documented, Liaoning remains a critical hub for entomological research in China. \n\n(Word count: 250)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary about Liaoning province in China, focusing on the distribution of various fly species. First, I need to go through all the provided descriptions and extract the key information. There are a lot of entries here, so I should organize them by the species mentioned and note the specific locations within Liaoning if available.\n\nStarting with the entities, the main one is \"LIAONING,\" which is a province in China. The descriptions mention multiple species, some with scientific names and others with Chinese names. I need to make sure to include both and perhaps translate the Chinese names if possible, but maybe the user just wants them listed as they are. Also, some entries have specific cities like Shenyang, Benxi, Fushun, etc. I should group those to show where within Liaoning the species are found.\n\nI notice some contradictions. For example, one entry says \"Liaoning is a province in China where certain parasitic fly species are distributed,\" while another mentions \"Liaoning is a Chinese province where multiple species including Lispe tentaculata and Lispe consanguinea are distributed.\" I need to check if these are different species or if there's overlap. Since they don't contradict each other directly, I can combine them under the broader category of multiple species.\n\nAnother point is the mention of the 1960s柞蚕饰腹寄蝇 outbreaks. That's a specific historical event, so I should include that as a notable fact. Also, the Liaoning Provincial Health and Epidemic Prevention Station is mentioned as preserving specimens, which adds context about research or documentation efforts.\n\nI need to be careful with the Chinese names. For example, \"985瓣腹绿蝇\" and \"1431家蚕追寄蝇\" – these might be specific species or local names. Since the user provided them in the data, I should include them as they are, maybe in quotes or with the Chinese characters, to maintain accuracy.\n\nSome entries repeat the same information, like multiple mentions of Phaonia species. I should consolidate those to avoid redundancy. Also, note the specific localities like Qianshan as holotype locality for Phaonia mimofausta.\n\nI should structure the summary by first introducing Liaoning as a province in Northeast China, then list the various species with their distribution areas, and mention any key locations or institutions. Make sure to use third person and keep it under 500 words. Check for any conflicting info, but since most are just different species, it's more about compiling all the data coherently. Finally, ensure that all entity names are included and the summary is comprehensive without being too verbose.\n"}}], "created": 1754033369, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1669, "prompt_tokens": 3455, "total_tokens": 5124, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 556, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
