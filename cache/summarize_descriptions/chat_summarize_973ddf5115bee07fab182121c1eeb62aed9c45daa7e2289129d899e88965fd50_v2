Their work spans multiple decades, beginning with a 1959 study on larval development in human feces and continuing through the 1990s. FAN established the **Blaesoxiphini tribe** in 1965 and co-established the subgenus **Apicamplexa** with Qian. They also described the genus **Sinochirosia** in 1988 and the genus **Burmanomyia** in 1964.  \n\nFAN’s taxonomic work includes numerous species and subspecies. In 1965, they described *Mesembrina montana asternopleuralis*, *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) shenyangensis*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) hainanensis*, *Musca pilifacies*, *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Pegomya japonica mokanensis*, *Pegomya chinensis*, *Metopia amamiensis*, *Musca tibetana*, *Pollenia rudis*, *Protocalliphora lii*, and *Craspedochoeta pullulula*. They also co-described *Isomyia latimarginata*, *Isomyia lingulata*, and *Isomyia furcicula* in 1986 with Fang.  \n\nIn the 1980s, FAN expanded their focus to include species such as *Delia tenuipensis* and *Delia quadrilateralis* (1982), *Delia latissima* (1984), *Delia penicillella* (1984), and *Delia sphaerobasis* (1984). They co-authored descriptions of *Hydrophoria pronata* with Qian, *Paradelia nototrigona* (1982), *Lasiomma graciliapicum* (1982), and *Lasiomma divergens* (1982). FAN also described multiple **Drymeia** species, including *Drymeia cinerascens*, *Drymeia pectinitibia*, *Drymeia oculipilosa*, *Drymeia brevifacies*, and *Drymeia yadongensis*, as well as *Dexopollenia uniseta* and *Hylemya bruneipalpis* (1982).  \n\nTheir research in the 1980s and 1990s included the genus *Alliopsis* and species like *Alliopsis gigantosternita*, *Alliopsis rectiforceps*, and *Alliopsis heterophalla*. FAN described *Pegohylemyia mediospicula* (拟山字泉种蝇) and *Pegohylemyia qinghaisenecio* (青泽菊泉种蝇) in 1984, and *Pegomya dichaetomyiola nudapicalis*, *Pegomya crinisternita*, and *Pegomya tenuiramula* in 1982. They co-established the subgenus **Deliomyia** in 1988 and described *Lispe lanceoseta* with Wang, *Lispe alpinicola* in 1981, and *Lispe anthomyioides* in 1988.  \n\nFAN’s work on **Phaonia** species includes *Phaonia lucidula*, *Phaonia insetitibia*, *Phaonia paucispina*, and *Phaonia latimargina*, often collaborating with Fang. They also described *Syngamoptera gigas* and *Syngamoptera angustifrons* in 1990, and *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* in 1965. In 1982, they described *Strobilomyia melaniola* and *Strobilomyia luteoforceps*, and in 1984, *Paraprosalpia lutebasicosta* and *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae*.  \n\nAdditional contributions include the 1981 description of *Ceylonomyia* and *Bengalia (Ochromyia) taiwanensis*, the 1982 *Hypoderma qinghaiense*, and the 1984 *Calliphora zaidamensis*. FAN co-authored works on *Isomyia xishuangensis*, *Isomyia pentochaeta*, and *Isomyia furcicula* (1986), as well as *Paradichosia blaesostyla* and *Paradichosia kangdingensis*. They described the subspecies *Adia grisella asiatica* (1988) and *Mesembrina resplendens ciliimaculata* (1965), and the species *Egle anthomyioides*, *Pierretia bihami* (1981 with Qian), and *Azelia fengi*.  \n\nFAN’s research was published in journals such as *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, *昆虫学研究集刊*, and *昆虫分类学报*, reflecting their role in advancing entomological taxonomy in China. Their work on genera like *Polleniopsis* (e.g., *Polleniopsis lata*, *Polleniopsis deqingensis*) and *Tuberomembrana* (1981) further underscores their impact. Notably, they described *Xenotachina* species as new to science and co-established the subgenus *Sinolucilia* in 1965. FAN’s legacy includes over 50 species and subspecies, with collaborations spanning decades and multiple taxonomic groups.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided, which is all about the entity \"FAN\". The data includes multiple descriptions of FAN's work in entomology, specifically in describing various species, subspecies, genera, and tribes. \n\nFirst, I need to go through each description and note the key points. There are a lot of species and subspecies mentioned, so I should categorize them to avoid repetition. For example, FAN is mentioned as describing several Pegomya species, multiple Drymeia species, and some genera like Sinochirosia and Burmanomyia. \n\nI also notice some contradictions or overlapping information. For instance, some entries mention the same species being described in different years or with different co-authors. I need to check if these are actually the same or different. For example, \"A researcher who described multiple Drymeia species\" and \"Author who described multiple Drymeia species in entomological publications\" seem to refer to the same work, so I can combine them.\n\nNext, I should organize the information chronologically where possible. FAN's work spans from 1957 to 1992, with key years like 1965, 1982, 1984, 1988, and 1990. Mentioning the establishment of the Blaesoxiphini tribe in 1965 and the genus Sinochirosia in 1988 would help structure the timeline.\n\nI need to ensure that all the species and subspecies are included. Some are in Chinese, like \"细柄折蜂麻蝇\" and \"钩镰折蜂麻蝇\", so I should note those as well. Also, co-authors like Qian, Chen, Fang, and Wang are mentioned, so I should list them appropriately.\n\nThere are a few entries that mention FAN as a co-author. I should group those together, specifying the co-authors and the species. For example, \"Co-author of Isomyia xishuangensis, Isomyia pentochaeta, and Isomyia furcicula (1986)\" and \"FAN is a co-author of Phaonia latimargina, Phaonia paucispina, and Phaonia cercoechinata with FANG\" can be combined under co-authorship.\n\nI also need to check for any conflicting information. For example, \"A Chinese entomologist who described the subspecies Mesembrina montana asternopleuralis in 1965\" and \"Fan is the person who described the subspecies Mesembrina resplendens ciliimaculata\" both mention subspecies in 1965. Since they are different subspecies, they can be listed together.\n\nThe user wants the summary in third person and to include entity names. I should start by stating FAN's role as a Chinese entomologist and taxonomist. Then, list the key contributions, grouping similar ones. Mention the establishment of tribes and genera, then move to species and subspecies, noting the years and co-authors where applicable.\n\nI need to be careful with the formatting. The final summary should be concise, under 500 words, so I'll need to be thorough but not verbose. Also, some entries have Chinese names, so I should include both the Chinese and scientific names if available.\n\nLet me start drafting the summary. First, introduce FAN as a Chinese entomologist and taxonomist. Then, list the major works: establishing the Blaesoxiphini tribe in 1965, describing the genus Sinochirosia in 1988. Then move to species descriptions, grouping by genus and year. Mention co-authors for each relevant entry. Ensure that all the species and subspecies are covered without repetition. Check for any missing details, like the 1959 study on larval development. Also, note the journals where some works were published, like Acta Entomologica Sinica and 昆虫学研究集刊.\n\nWait, there's a mention of \"Author of Eutrichota gigas Fan\" and \"Researcher involved in describing multiple Eutrichota species\". I should combine those. Similarly, the Drymeia species are mentioned multiple times, so consolidate those into a list.\n\nI need to make sure that the summary flows logically, starting from the earliest works to the latest, and grouping similar contributions. Also, check for any inconsistencies in the data. For example, \"A researcher who described the species Atherigona bella sinobella in 1965\" and \"Author of the 1965 description of Atherigona triglomerata\" – are these the same? If not, list both.\n\nFinally, ensure that the summary is coherent, resolves any contradictions by checking if the same species is mentioned in different contexts, and that all the information is included. Keep the language formal and third person, avoiding any markdown formatting.\n"}}], "created": 1754041768, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2393, "prompt_tokens": 4409, "total_tokens": 6802, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 1054, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
