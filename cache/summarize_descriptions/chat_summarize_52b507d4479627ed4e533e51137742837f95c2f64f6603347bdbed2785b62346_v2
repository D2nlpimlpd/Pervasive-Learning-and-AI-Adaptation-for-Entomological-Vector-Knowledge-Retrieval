This designation indicates that the site is the geographic reference point where the original specimens of *Paraprosalpia tibialis* were collected and described, serving as the foundation for the species' taxonomic classification. Both provided descriptions confirm its role as the type locality in Shanxi for this particular species, with no conflicting information present. The entity is specifically tied to the field of entomology or paleontology, depending on the context of *Paraprosalpia tibialis*, which may refer to a fossil or extant organism. As a type locality, FANGSHAN YANGGETAI holds scientific significance for researchers studying the distribution, morphology, or evolutionary history of *Paraprosalpia tibialis*, as it provides a standardized geographical anchor for future comparisons and analyses. The consistency between the two descriptions ensures clarity in its identification and purpose within the broader study of the species. No additional details about the site’s ecological, geological, or cultural characteristics are included in the provided data, as the focus is solely on its taxonomic relevance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to generate a comprehensive summary for the entity \"FANGSHAN YANGGETAI\" based on the provided descriptions. The data given has two descriptions, both mentioning that it's a location in Shanxi, China, and the type locality for Paraprosalpia tibialis. \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what a type locality is. From what I remember, in taxonomy, the type locality is the specific geographic location where a type specimen was collected, which is used to define a species. So, this place is important because it's where the type specimen for Paraprosalpia tibialis was found.\n\nNow, looking at the two descriptions: they both say it's in Shanxi, China, and the type locality for the same species. There's no contradiction here; they just repeat the same information. The user mentioned if there are contradictions, resolve them, but in this case, both descriptions align. \n\nI need to combine them into a single, coherent summary. The key points are the entity name, location (Shanxi, China), and its role as the type locality for Paraprosalpia tibialis. I should also mention that the two descriptions are essentially the same, so the summary just needs to state that fact once. \n\nThe user wants the summary in third person and to include the entity names for context. I should start by introducing FANGSHAN YANGGETAI as a location in Shanxi, then explain its significance as the type locality. Since both descriptions are the same, I don't need to add anything else. Maybe check if there's any additional info I can infer, but the data provided is limited. \n\nI need to keep it under 500 words. Since the information is minimal, the summary should be concise. Let me structure it: first sentence introduces the entity and location, second sentence explains the type locality aspect. That should cover all the given data without redundancy. \n\nWait, the user said \"if the provided descriptions are contradictory, please resolve the contradictions and provide a single, coherent summary.\" Here, the two descriptions are not contradictory, just repetitive. So the summary just needs to present the combined information once. \n\nMake sure to use third person. Avoid any personal pronouns. Also, check for any possible typos or formatting issues. The entity name is in quotes, but in the output, it's written without quotes. Should I follow that? The example output shows the entity name in quotes in the input but not in the output. So probably just write it as FANGSHAN YANGGETAI in the summary. \n\nDouble-check the species name: Paraprosalpia tibialis. It's a scientific name, so italics might be needed, but the user didn't specify. The example output doesn't use italics, so I'll stick to the given format. \n\nAlright, putting it all together. The summary should be a single sentence or two, but maybe expand a bit to meet the word limit. However, since the data is limited, I can't add much. Just state the facts clearly and concisely. Make sure to mention that both descriptions refer to the same entity and role. \n\nFinal check: third person, entity names included, no contradictions, all info from the descriptions. Looks good. Let me write the summary now.\n"}}], "created": 1754035610, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 957, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 1143, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 703, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
