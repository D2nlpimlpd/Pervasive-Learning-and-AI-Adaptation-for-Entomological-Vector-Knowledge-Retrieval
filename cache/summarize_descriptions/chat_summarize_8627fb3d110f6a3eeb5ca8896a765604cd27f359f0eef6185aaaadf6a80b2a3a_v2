The region hosts a wide array of dipteran insects, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Frontina laeta*, *Helina calceataeformis* (specifically in Zhaowuda League, Chifeng), *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Muscina stabulans*, *Muscina angustifrons*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Sarcophaga variegata*, *Zenillia dolosa*, and *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *albiceps*. Tachina species such as *Tachina albidopilosa* and *Tachina nupta* are also documented there. Specific locations within Inner Mongolia, like Jining, Tumertei, Linhe, Siziwang Banner, Xilingol League, Hohhot (including Dagao Mountain and Naoxintai), Hulunbeier League, and Alashan Banner, are highlighted as key habitats for various species. For instance, *Cephalopina titillator* is found in Hohhot and Alashan Banner, while *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus* and *Oestromyia tarandi* occur in the northern Greater Khingan Range. \n\nThe region is notable for its biodiversity of genera and subgenera, including *Sarcophaga* (e.g., *KENT'S SARCOPHAGA*), *Protomiltogramma* (two species), *Strobilomyia* (e.g., *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Strobilomyia laricicola* in Ganhe and Guxuan), *Hydrophoria* (e.g., *Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*), and *Miltogramma* (*Miltogramma bimaculatum*, *Miltogramma tibitum*). Species such as *Phaenicia jagedaqiensis*, *Phaonia malaisei*, *Phaonia changbaishanensis*, and *Phaonia beizhenesis* are reported in Guyuan and other areas. The Caesar Greenbottle Fly and Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly are also present, alongside *Muscina assimilis* in Yitulihé, Tuluihé, and Genhé, and *Muscina atrifimbriae* in Jiagedaqi. \n\nInner Mongolia’s ecological diversity supports species like *Calliphora axata* (Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner, Hohhot), *Calliphora genarum* (southeastern Naoxintai), *Calliphora nigribarbis*, *Cynomya mortuorum*, and *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*. Notable distributions include *Haematobia titillans* and *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* in Alashan and Wuchuan Banner, *Paraprosalpia recta*, *Protocalliphora lii*, and *Blaesoxipha litoralis* (Keshiketeng Banner). The region is also home to *Carcelia lymantriae*, *Carcelia kockiana*, *Delia bisetosa*, *Delia sphaerobasis* (Ejina Banner), and *Delia planipalpis*. \n\nAdditional species documented in Inner Mongolia include *1238黑条蝇*, *1254钝叶污蝇*, *1256黑须污蝇*, *1281毛股折麻蝇*, *1341细角细麻蝇* (type locality), *1396犁头亚麻蝇* (Guoyuan), *731 BINGLU FLY*, *Austrophorocera*, *Azelia fengi*, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Chionomyia vetula*, *Coenosia dilatitarsis*, *Dasyphora trichosterna*, *Dasyphora asiatica*, *Dasyphora albofasciata*, *Gonia bimaculata*, *Leucophora unilineata*, *Lydella grisescens*, *Macronychia griseola* and *Macronychia polyodon*, *Mydaea setifemur* and *Mydaea sinensis*, *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae*, *Peteina erinaceus*, *Polleniopsis mongolica*, *Senotainia deserta*, *Apodacra pulchra*, *Servaisia rossica*, *Sarcophaga erythrura*, and *Voria ruralis*. The genera *Zaira*, *Meigenia* (e.g., *Meigenia grandigena* in Dongwuqi), *Alashan Wohlfahrtia* (Alashan Banner), and *Bayan Wohlfahrtia* (Bayanhote) are also recorded. \n\nStudies on host relationships and outbreaks, such as those involving the Brush Spring Fly and *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (type locality in Hohhot), further underscore Inner Mongolia’s ecological importance. The region’s role as a domestic distribution hub for species like *Musca conducens*, *Musca bezzii*, *Musca sorbens*, *Musca tempestiva*, and *Musca autumnalis* highlights its significance in entomological research. With over 50 species and genera documented, Inner Mongolia serves as a critical area for understanding fly biodiversity in northern China.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary about the distribution of various fly species in Inner Mongolia, China. The data provided is a list of descriptions, all related to Inner Mongolia. First, I need to go through each description and note the species mentioned.\n\nHmm, some entries mention specific locations within Inner Mongolia like Hohhot, Zhaowuda League, Chifeng, Ejina Banner, etc. I should make sure to include those. Also, there are a few repeated mentions of certain species, like Voria ruralis and Musca conducens. I need to consolidate those to avoid redundancy.\n\nWait, there are some Chinese names in the list, like 1238黑条蝇 and 细角细麻蝇. I should check if these have English translations or if they should be kept as is. The user probably wants the summary in English, so maybe I can note them in parentheses or use the English names if available. For example, \"细角细麻蝇\" might be a specific species name, but I don't recognize it immediately. Maybe it's best to include the Chinese names with the English translations if possible, or just list them as part of the species names.\n\nAlso, some entries mention genera like Sarcophaga, Protomiltogramma, and Strobilomyia. I need to list all the species under these genera. There are a few contradictions or overlapping mentions. For example, \"A Chinese region where the species is distributed\" is vague, but other entries specify particular species. I should resolve that by including the specific species where possible.\n\nI need to structure the summary by first stating that Inner Mongolia is an autonomous region in northern China. Then, list the various fly species and their specific locations. Group similar species together if they are mentioned in the same context. For example, multiple species under the same genus or family. Also, note any studies or host relationships mentioned, like the one about the host relationship of a fly species being studied there.\n\nMake sure to mention all the specific locations: Hohhot, Tumertei, Linhe, Siziwang Banner, Xilingol League, Hulunbeier League, Alashan Banner, Dongwuqi, Shandianba, etc. Also, check for any repeated mentions of the same species in different locations and combine them.\n\nI should also be careful with the formatting. The user wants it in third person, include entity names for context, and keep it under 500 words. Avoid using markdown, just plain text. Let me start by listing all the species and their locations, then organize them into a coherent paragraph, making sure to mention the autonomous region status and the northern location. Check for any contradictions, like if a species is mentioned in two different areas but that's okay as long as it's accurate. Finally, ensure the summary is comprehensive but concise, covering all the provided data without exceeding the word limit.\n"}}], "created": 1754104747, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1888, "prompt_tokens": 2736, "total_tokens": 4624, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 605, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
