It hosts a diverse array of flies, including *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*, *Eutrichota inornata*, *Frontina laeta*, *Helina calceataeformis* (specifically in Zhaowuda League, Chifeng), *Lydella grisescens*, *Metopia argyrocephala*, *Musca autumnalis*, *Muscina stabulans* and *Muscina angustifrons*, *Protophormia terraenovae*, *Sarcophaga variegata*, *Zenillia dolosa*, and the species *Parasarcophaga jacobsoni* and *albiceps*. The region is also home to *Tachina nupta* and *Tachina albidopilosa*, as well as *Peteina erinaceus* and the Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly (*Lucilia illustris*). \n\nInner Mongolia’s fly fauna includes multiple genera and species documented in specific locations. For example, *Calliphora axata* is found in Zhaomeng Wengniute Banner and Hohhot, while *Calliphora genarum* occurs in the southeastern part (Naoxintai). The region supports *Chionomyia vetula* in Hohhot, *Cynomya mortuorum*, and *Cynomyiomima stackelbergi*. Notable distributions include *Miltogrammoides zimini* and *Miltogramma* species, *Muscina assimilis* in Yitulihé, Tuluihé, and Genhé, and *Muscina* species in Jiagedaqi. The genera *Hydrophoria* (e.g., *Hydrophoria melaena*, *Hydrophoria wierzejskii*), *Strobilomyia* (e.g., *Strobilomyia melaniola*, *Strobilomyia laricicola* in Ganhe and Guxuan), and *Parasarcophaga* are also documented. \n\nSpecific species with localized records include *Eumetopiella (Asiaraba) kozlovi* in Alashan and Wuchuan Banner, *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (type locality in Hohhot, also in Beijing’s Wofosi, Yanqing), *1238黑条蝇* (Black-streaked Fly), *细角细麻蝇* (Narrow-horned Small House Fly), *1254钝叶污蝇* and *1256黑须污蝇* (Blunt-leaf and Black-bearded Filth Flies), and *731 BINGLU FLY* (Binglu Fly). The region is a type locality for *1341细角细麻蝇* and *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae*. Additional species include *Austrophorocera*, *Barbata Fannia*, *Bayan Wohlfahrtia* (Bayanhote), *Alashan Wohlfahrtia* (Alashan Banner), *Wohlfahrtiodes mongolicus*, *Voria ruralis*, *Oestromyia* (including *O. tarandi* in the northern Greater Khingan Range), and *1281毛股折麻蝇* (Hairy-thighed Folded Fly). \n\nInner Mongolia’s biodiversity extends to *Phaenicia* species like *Phaonia jagedaqiensis* and *Phaonia malaisei*, as well as *Phaonia changbaishanensis* and *Phaonia beizhenesis* in Guyuan. The genera *Zaira* and *Meigenia* are present in Dongwuqi, while *Meigenia grandigena* is specifically found there. *Subhylemyia lineola* and *Blaesoxipha litoralis* occur in the region, alongside *Dasyphora trichosterna*, *Dasyphora asiatica*, and *Dasyphora albofasciata*. *Delia* species such as *Delia sphaerobasis* (Ejina Banner, Lanzhou Medical College) and *Delia bisetosa* are documented, as are *Miltogramma bimaculatum* and *Miltogramma tibitum*. \n\nThe region is also notable for *Fannia scalaris* and *Fannia subscalaris*, *Gonia bimaculata*, *Muscina recta*, *Muscina sorbens*, *Muscina tempestiva*, and *Polleniopsis mongolica*. *Protocalliphora lii*, *Prosena* genus, *Brontaea* species, and *Servaisia rossica* are found here. *Exorista larvarum* and *Haematobia titillans* (Biting Fly) are distributed in Inner Mongolia, as are *Jining*, *Tumertei*, *Linhe*, *Siziwang Banner*, and *Xilingol League* as specific locations for multiple fly species. The autonomous region is further associated with *KENT’S SARCOPHAGA*, *SHUANG YANGYING*, and *Caesar Greenbottle Fly*, as well as *Blaesoxipha unicolor* in Keshiketeng Banner and *Agriella gobica* in the western Gobi Desert. Studies on host relationships of fly species have been conducted in the region, underscoring its ecological importance for entomological research. \n\nThis summary consolidates Inner Mongolia’s role as a key domestic distribution area for over 50 fly species, emphasizing its status as an autonomous region in northern China with diverse habitats supporting both common and regionally unique taxa. Contradictions in the data (e.g., references to \"province\" vs. \"autonomous region\") are resolved by consistently using \"autonomous region\" to align with official classifications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about Inner Mongolia's distribution of various fly species. First, I need to parse all the descriptions and note the entities and their locations. There are a lot of species mentioned, some with Chinese names and others in Latin. I should make sure to include all of them without missing any.\n\nI notice that some descriptions mention specific locations within Inner Mongolia, like Hohhot, Zhaowuda League, Ejina Banner, etc. I need to group these by the specific areas to make the summary more organized. Also, there are repeated mentions of certain species, such as Voria ruralis and Musca species. I should consolidate those to avoid redundancy.\n\nThere are a few contradictions or variations in the data. For example, some entries refer to Inner Mongolia as a province, while others call it an autonomous region. I should check if that's accurate. Wait, in China, Inner Mongolia is indeed an autonomous region, not a province. So I need to correct that in the summary to maintain accuracy.\n\nAnother point is the use of both Chinese and Latin names. The user probably wants the Latin names included where possible, but some entries have Chinese names in pinyin or characters. I'll need to mention both if they are provided, but maybe translate the Chinese names to their Latin equivalents if known. However, some might not have direct translations, so I'll keep them as they are unless I can find the corresponding scientific names.\n\nI also need to ensure that the summary is in third person and includes the entity names. The user wants a single, coherent summary, so I should resolve any contradictions. For instance, if a species is mentioned in two different locations, I should combine those into one statement. Also, check for any duplicate entries and merge them.\n\nLet me start by listing all the species and their specific locations. Then, I'll structure the summary by regions within Inner Mongolia and the species found there. I should mention the autonomous region status, its location in northern China, and the various fly species distributed there, including both genera and specific species. Also, note the specific banners and cities where certain species are found.\n\nI need to be careful with the formatting. The user specified a 500-word limit, so I have to be concise but comprehensive. Avoid using markdown and keep it in plain text. Make sure to mention all the species and locations without exceeding the word count. Maybe group similar species together or mention multiple species in a single sentence where possible.\n\nWait, some entries have Chinese names followed by numbers, like 1238黑条蝇. I should include those as they are, perhaps noting that they are Chinese names for specific species. Also, check if any species are mentioned with their Latin names in brackets or asterisks, like *Lucilia (Phaenicia) sericata*. I'll need to present those correctly, maybe using the full scientific name if possible.\n\nI should also look for any specific studies or host relationships mentioned. For example, one entry says \"the host relationship of the fly species was studied\" in Inner Mongolia. That's important to include as it adds context beyond just distribution.\n\nNow, compiling all this information. Start with a general statement about Inner Mongolia being an autonomous region in northern China. Then list the various fly species, grouping them by genera or specific locations. Make sure to mention the specific banners, cities, and regions like Hohhot, Zhaowuda League, Ejina Banner, etc. Also, include the species that are part of the same genus or have similar distribution patterns.\n\nCheck for any repeated mentions of the same species in different locations and combine them. For example, Voria ruralis is mentioned twice, so I can note that it's found in Inner Mongolia. Similarly, Musca species like Musca autumnalis and Musca bezzii can be grouped.\n\nFinally, ensure the summary is coherent, flows well, and includes all necessary information without contradictions. Verify the autonomous region status, correct any misclassifications (like province vs. autonomous region), and present the data in a clear, third-person narrative.\n"}}], "created": 1754197385, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2180, "prompt_tokens": 2736, "total_tokens": 4916, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 845, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
