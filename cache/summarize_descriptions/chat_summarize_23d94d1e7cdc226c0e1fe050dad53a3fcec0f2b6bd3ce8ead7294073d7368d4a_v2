The scientific name *Gonia klapperichi* was formally introduced by Mesnil, who is credited as the taxonomic authority for this species. This classification establishes Mesnil as the describer of *Gonia klapperichi*, with the year 1956 marking the official recognition of the species in scientific literature.

The user wants me to generate a comprehensive summary from the given data. The entities are \"GONIA KLAPPERICHI\" and \"MESNIL\". The descriptions mention that Mesnil described Gonia klapperichi in 1956 and that Mesnil is the describer of that species.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the relationship between the two entities. Gonia klapperichi is a species, and Mesnil is the person who described it. The key points here are the name of the species, the describer, and the year of description. Both descriptions are about the same fact, just phrased differently. There's no contradiction here, so I don't need to resolve any conflicting information.\n\nI should start by stating the full scientific name of the species, then mention Mesnil as the describer and the year 1956. Since both descriptions are essentially the same, I can combine them into a single sentence. The user wants the summary in third person and to include the entity names for context. Also, the summary should be under 500 words. \n\nWait, the example output they provided is just a single sentence. Maybe they want a more detailed summary, but the data given is very limited. The only information available is the description by Mesnil in 1956. I can't add any other details because there's no data provided. So the summary should just be that Mesnil described Gonia klapperichi in 1956. \n\nI need to check if there's any other possible information. The species name is in italics in the example, but the user didn't specify formatting. Since the example uses italics, maybe I should follow that. Also, the entity names should be included, so I need to make sure both \"GONIA KLAPPERICHI\" and \"MESNIL\" are mentioned. \n\nNo contradictions here, so the summary is straightforward. Just combine the two descriptions into one, ensuring clarity and proper context. Let me make sure the sentence is concise and includes all necessary information without redundancy. Alright, that should do it.\n"}}], "created": 1754106930, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 623, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 803, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 443, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
