It is documented as the type locality for several species, including *612黄髭芒蝇* (Coimbatore), *Paradichosia scutellata* (Darjeeling), *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons* (Kashmir), and *Stomoxys indicus*. The country hosts a wide array of species, such as *Musca convexifrons*, *Musca formosana*, *Musca malaisei*, *Musca craggi*, *Musca seniorwhitei*, *Musca larvipara*, and *Musca crassirostris*, which are found in various regions. Additionally, *Muscina assimilis* and *Synthesiomyia nudiseta* are reported in India, alongside *Lucilia (Phaenicia) cuprina cuprina* and *Sarcophaga haematodes*.  \n\nIndia’s biodiversity includes multiple *Dichaetomyia* species (e.g., *LUTEIVENTRIS*, *APICALIS*, *SETIFEMUR*, and *Dichaetomyia quadrata*), as well as *Isomyia electa*, *Isomyia viridaurea*, and *Isomyia nebulosa*. The country is also home to *Pygophora respondens*, *Caiusa testacea*, *Bengalia* species, *Bercaea cruentata*, *Borbororhina bivittata*, *Borbororhinia bivittata*, *Metalliopsis setosa*, *Rhyncomya flavibasis*, *Pegomyy bicolor*, *Pegomya quadrivittata*, *Polietes orientalis* (notably in northern regions), *Sturmiopsis inferens*, *Tainanina pilisquama*, *Halydaia* and *Linnaemya* species, *Hemipyrellia liguriens*, *Lixophaga parva*, *Subhylemyia longula*, and *Ophyra chalcogaster*.  \n\nRegion-specific records highlight India’s ecological diversity: *紫翠蝇* and *绿翠蝇* are documented in the country, while *1340杯细麻蝇* and *1397卡西亚麻蝇* (type locality for the latter) are found in Assam and other areas. The southern region of India is noted for *Hydrotaea affinis*, and the eastern region for *Leucomyia cinerea*. Kashmir serves as the type locality for *Myospila meditabunda angustifrons*, and Darjeeling is linked to *Paradichosia scutellata* and *Eudasyphora cyanicolor*.  \n\nIndia is also recognized as an international distribution location for species such as *Limnophora prominens*, *Limnophora exigua*, *Limnophora fallax fallax*, *Adia* genus, *Scathophaga mellipes*, *Neomyia* species, *Drino inconspicua*, *Calythea setifrons*, and *Muscidae* subfamilies. The country is part of the global range for *Sarcosolomonia crinita*, *Sarcophaga misera*, *Sarcophaga sericea*, *Sarcophaga aegyptica*, and *Stomorhina* genus species, though these are described as \"foreign\" in some references.  \n\nNotably, the Indian greenbottle fly (*Broad-Faced Greenbottle Fly*) and species like *612黄髭芒蝇* and *613点芒蝇* are documented, with the former’s type locality in Coimbatore. Other regionally significant species include *Cephalopina titillator*, *Parasarcophaga albiceps*, *Caricea boops*, *Cosmina bicolor*, *Cosmina limbipennis*, and *Brontaea lasiopa* (type locality). The genus *Argyrophylax* (e.g., *A. phoeda*, *A. nigrotibialis*) and *Thecocarcelia parnarae* are also reported.  \n\nIn summary, India’s varied ecosystems support a rich assemblage of fly species, with many documented in specific regions like Assam, Kashmir, and Darjeeling. It serves as both a primary distribution area and an international range for several genera, including *Musca*, *Dichaetomyia*, *Limnophora*, and *Sarcophaga*, while also hosting unique type localities for key species. This underscores India’s ecological importance in entomological studies and its role in the global biodiversity of flies.

The user wants a comprehensive summary about India's role in the distribution of various fly species. First, I need to go through all the descriptions provided and make sure I don't miss any key points. \n\nStarting with the entities, it's just \"INDIA\", so all the descriptions are about India. The challenge is to combine all these into a single, coherent summary without contradictions. I notice some descriptions mention specific regions within India like Assam, Darjeeling, Kashmir, Coimbatore, and others. I should group those together to show regional distribution.\n\nThere are a lot of species listed here. I need to categorize them to avoid repetition. For example, multiple mentions of Musca species: Musca convexifrons, Musca formosana, Musca malaisei, Musca craggi, Musca seniorwhitei, Musca larvipara, Musca crassirostris, Muscina assimilis, Synthesiomyia nudiseta. I can list them as a group. Similarly, Dichaetomyia species like LUTEIVENTRIS, APICALIS, SETIFEMUR, and Dichaetomyia quadrata. \n\nSome entries mention type localities, which are important for taxonomy. For instance, Coimbatore for 612黄髭芒蝇, Darjeeling for Paradichosia scutellata, and Kashmir for Myospila meditabunda angustifrons. I should highlight these as type localities to add specific context.\n\nI also see some Chinese names like 612黄髭芒蝇 and 1397卡西亚麻蝇. I need to include those but maybe note that they are Chinese names for the species. The user probably wants the summary in English, so I'll mention the Chinese names as part of the species documentation.\n\nThere are mentions of genera and subfamilies, like Adia, Scathophaga mellipes, and Muscidae subfamilies. I should include these to show broader taxonomic presence. Also, some entries refer to India as a \"foreign location\" or \"abroad distribution location,\" which might be due to the perspective of the study. I need to clarify that India is a South Asian country and part of the international distribution for certain species.\n\nI need to check for contradictions. For example, some entries say \"foreign country\" while others just say \"country.\" Since all are about India, I can explain that in the context of the species' global distribution, India is considered a foreign location. Also, some species are mentioned in multiple regions, so I should note that.\n\nThe summary should be in third person and include the entity names. I'll start by stating India is a South Asian country with diverse fly species. Then list the main genera and species, grouping them by type and noting type localities. Mention the regions within India where specific species are found, like Assam, Kashmir, etc. Also, include the international aspect for species that are found there as part of their global distribution.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is under 500 words. Let me count the key points: multiple Musca species, Dichaetomyia species, specific genera like Lucilia, Sarcophaga, Thecocarcelia, etc., type localities, regions in India, and international distribution notes. I'll structure it by first introducing India as a South Asian country, then list the species by their taxonomic groups, mention the regions, and address the international context where applicable.\n\nWait, some entries have the same species mentioned in different ways. For example, \"Country where *Limnophora prominens* and *Limnophora exigua* are distributed\" and \"An international distribution location for Limnophora fallax fallax)|\\nAn international distribution location for Limnophora prominens)|\". I need to combine these, noting that Limnophora prominens is found in India, and others like fallax and exigua are part of the international distribution.\n\nAlso, some species have Chinese names, which I should include but maybe in parentheses or with a note. For example, 612黄髭芒蝇 and 613点芒蝇. I can mention that these species are documented in India with their Chinese names.\n\nI should resolve any contradictions. For instance, if a species is mentioned as being in India and also as a foreign location, that's because the study is from another country. So I can clarify that India is a foreign distribution area for some species in the context of the text.\n\nFinally, ensure the summary is concise, includes all the species and regions, and flows logically. Check for any repeated information and merge it. Make sure to mention the type localities and the regions where they are found. Also, note the international distribution aspect for species that are part of that.\n"}}], "created": 1754191635, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2054, "prompt_tokens": 1695, "total_tokens": 3749, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 1012, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
