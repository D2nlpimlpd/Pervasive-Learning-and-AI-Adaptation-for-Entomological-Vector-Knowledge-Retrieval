These insects are distinguished by their unique morphological features, including a specialized **proboscis** for feeding and the presence of **genal setae** (upcurved peristomal bristles) on their heads. The family encompasses a diverse range of species, many of which are important pollinators due to their hovering flight behavior and flower-visiting habits.  \n\nA notable subfamily within Syrphidae is **Eristalinae**, whose larvae possess a long, retractable **breathing tube** (siphon) adapted for aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. This subfamily is often associated with habitats containing **human or animal feces**, where the larvae develop. The breathing tube allows the larvae to remain submerged while still accessing oxygen at the water’s surface, a key adaptation for survival in such nutrient-rich but potentially oxygen-poor conditions. While the broader Syrphidae family is typically linked to ecological roles like pollination and pest control (as predators in some species), the Eristalinae subfamily diverges in its larval ecology, focusing on detritivorous or saprophagous lifestyles.  \n\nThe descriptions provided highlight both the general characteristics of the Syrphidae family and the specialized traits of the Eristalinae subfamily. The first emphasizes the subfamily’s larval adaptations and habitat, while the second outlines the family’s taxonomic classification and morphological features. These are not contradictory but complementary, as Eristalinae is a subset of Syrphidae. The resolution of the summary integrates both perspectives, clarifying that while Syrphidae as a whole includes hoverflies with genal setae and proboscis structures, the Eristalinae subfamily is distinguished by its siphon-equipped larvae and association with fecal matter.  \n\nIn total, Syrphidae is a taxonomically and ecologically significant group of flies, with species contributing to pollination, biological control of pests, and decomposition processes. The Eristalinae subfamily, in particular, exemplifies the family’s adaptability through its unique larval morphology and habitat preferences. This synthesis ensures all provided data is included coherently, maintaining third-person perspective and contextual clarity.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about the entity \"SYRPHIDAE\". The data includes two descriptions. First, I need to make sure I understand both descriptions correctly.\n\nThe first description mentions that Syrphidae is a family of flies, specifically the Eristalinae subfamily, whose larvae have a long, retractable breathing tube and are often found in human or animal feces. The second description states that Syrphidae is a family of flies known as hoverflies, part of the suborder Cyclorrhapha, characterized by their proboscis structure and genal setae (upcurved peristomal bristles).\n\nI notice that the first description refers to the Eristalinae subfamily, while the second one talks about the Syrphidae family as a whole. So, I need to integrate both pieces of information without contradiction. The key is to mention that Syrphidae includes the Eristalinae subfamily and then describe the general characteristics of the family, followed by specific traits of the subfamily.\n\nI should start by stating the family name and common name (hoverflies). Then, mention the suborder Cyclorrhapha. Next, the general characteristics: proboscis structure and genal setae. After that, introduce the Eristalinae subfamily, explaining their unique features like the retractable breathing tube and their habitat in feces. Also, note that the larvae's breathing tube is a key adaptation for their environment.\n\nI need to check if there's any contradiction. The first description says the larvae are found in feces, while the second doesn't mention that. But since the first is part of the Syrphidae family, it's a subset. So, the summary should clarify that while the family as a whole has certain traits, the Eristalinae subfamily has specific ones. That way, both descriptions are covered without conflict.\n\nAlso, the user wants the summary in third person, include entity names, and keep it under 500 words. I'll make sure to use \"Syrphidae\" and \"hoverflies\" appropriately, and mention the subfamily Eristalinae with its characteristics. Need to be concise but comprehensive, ensuring all provided info is included.
