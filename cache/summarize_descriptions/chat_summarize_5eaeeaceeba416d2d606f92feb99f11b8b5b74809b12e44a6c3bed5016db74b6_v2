Their research spans multiple genera and subgenera, including *Pegomya*, *Drymeia*, *Phaonia*, *Syngamoptera*, *Delia*, *Lispe*, *Hylemya*, *Craspedochoeta*, and others, with significant contributions to journals such as *Acta Entomologica Sinica*, *昆虫学研究集刊* (Insect Research Journal), and *动物学研究* (Zoological Research). FAN is credited with establishing the **Blaesoxiphini tribe** in 1965 and co-establishing the subgenus **Apicamplexa** with Qian. They described the genus *Sinochirosia* in 1982 and *Burmanomyia* in 1964, while also co-describing *Alliopsis* and *Alisarcophaga* genera. Notably, FAN introduced *Tuberomembrana* in 1981 and *Xenotachina* (as \"sp. n.\" in texts), alongside species like *Eumetopiella (Euaraba) mongolia* (1965) and *Dexopollenia uniseta* (1988).  \n\nFAN’s species descriptions are extensive and temporally diverse. In 1964, they described *Heteronychia quoi*. By 1965, their work included *Atherigona triglomerata*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) shenyangensis*, *Lucilia (Luciliella) hainanensis*, *Musca pilifacies*, *Pegomya phyllostachys*, *Protomiltogramma yunnanense*, *Syngamoptera gigas*, and the Chinese flat-headed fly *Catapicephala sinica*. In 1974, they described *Coelomyia ctenophora*. Collaborative efforts with colleagues like Qian, Fang, and Chen further expanded their impact, resulting in co-authored works such as *Isomyia latimarginata* and *Isomyia viridiscutellata* (1986), *Isomyia xishuangensis* and *Isomyia pentochaeta* (1986), *Nupedia henanensis*, *Enneastigma shanghaiensis*, and *Enneastigma pilosiventrosa* (with Chen), as well as *Paraprosalpia lutebasicosta* and *Paraprosalpia atrifimbriae* (1983). Their 1984 publications added *Drymeia yadongensis*, *Craspedochoeta pullulula*, and *Syngamoptera unilineata*, while 1988 saw the description of *Pegohylemyia mediospicula* (拟山字泉种蝇), *Pegohylemyia qinghaisenecio* (青泽菊泉种蝇), and *Adia grisella asiatica*. Subspecies attributed to FAN include *Mesembrina montana asternopleuralis* (1965) and *Miltogramma ibericum brachygonitum* (1965).  \n\nFAN’s research also includes ecological studies, such as a 1959 paper on larval development in human feces, and contributions to domestic distribution data of Chinese fly species. They described several *Polleniopsis* species, including *Polleniopsis lata*, *Polleniopsis deqingensis*, and *Polleniopsis yunnanensis* (1988). Their legacy is marked by naming conventions like *Sinolucilia* (1965) and *Sinochirosia* (1982), as well as foundational work in dipteran taxonomy across Asia. Collaborations with Qian, Fang, and Chen yielded additional genera and species, such as *Pierretia bihami* (1981) and *Ceylonomyia taiwanensis* (1981).  \n\nIn summary, FAN’s career as a taxonomist and entomologist is defined by meticulous morphological classification, ecological insights, and extensive collaboration. Their descriptions of species like *Coelomyia ctenophora*, *Heteronychia quoi*, and *Catapicephala sinica*, along with the establishment of tribes and subgenera, have solidified their role as a pivotal figure in the study of Chinese and Asian fly fauna. Their work remains a cornerstone for dipteran taxonomy, emphasizing biodiversity and systematic research in the region.

The user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of the data provided about the entity \"FAN\". The data includes multiple descriptions, some of which might be redundant or even contradictory. My job is to combine all these into a single, coherent summary in third person, making sure to include all the information and resolve any contradictions. The final summary should be under 500 words.\n\nFirst, I need to parse all the given descriptions. The main one is a detailed paragraph that's already 499 words. Then there are three shorter ones: Coelomyia ctenophora in 1974, Heteronychia quoi in 1964, and Catapicephala sinica in 1965. The main description mentions several genera and species, along with collaborations and publications. The shorter ones add more species to FAN's list. \n\nI need to check if the main description already includes these species. The main one lists a bunch of species from different years, but I don't see Coelomyia ctenophora, Heteronychia quoi, or Catapicephala sinica mentioned there. So, those are additional contributions that need to be incorporated. \n\nNow, the main challenge is to integrate these new pieces without making the summary too long. The user specified a 500-word limit, and the main description is already 499 words. Adding the three new species might push it over. I need to be concise. \n\nI should start by introducing FAN as a Chinese entomologist and taxonomist, then mention their key contributions. The main description already covers the tribes and subgenera they established, the genera they described, and their collaborations. I need to add the three new species into the list of species they described. \n\nWait, the main description lists species from 1965, 1986, 1982, 1984, 1988, and 1983. The new ones are from 1974, 1964, and 1965. So, I can mention Coelomyia ctenophora in 1974, Heteronychia quoi in 1964, and Catapicephala sinica in 1965. \n\nI need to make sure the years are correctly placed. The main description's 1965 section already includes some species, so adding Catapicephala sinica there. The 1964 entry in the main description mentions *Burmanomyia*, so Heteronychia quoi in 1964 can be added as another species from that year. Coelomyia ctenophora in 1974 is a new entry. \n\nAlso, the main summary ends with a conclusion that their contributions are foundational. I should ensure that the new species are included in that context. \n\nI need to check for any contradictions. The main description says FAN described *Burmanomyia* in 1964, and the second short description says Heteronychia quoi in 1964. That's okay, just adding another species from the same year. The third short description is about 1965, which the main one already covers, so adding Catapicephala sinica there. The fourth is 1974, which is a new year to mention. \n\nNow, the main summary is already 499 words. Adding three more species might require trimming some parts. For example, the main summary mentions \"their legacy includes naming conventions like...\" and lists some species. I can add the new ones there. \n\nWait, the user provided four descriptions. The first is a long one, and the next three are short. The fourth one has a typo with a closing angle bracket. I need to correct that. \n\nSo, the plan is: take the main summary, add the three new species into the appropriate sections (1964, 1965, 1974), and adjust the conclusion to mention these additions. Then, check the word count to ensure it's under 500. \n\nI should also make sure the entity name \"FAN\" is included each time, and the summary remains in third person. Let me start by integrating the new species into the existing structure. \n\nIn the main description, under 1965, they described several species. Adding Catapicephala sinica there. For 1964, they described *Burmanomyia* and now Heteronychia quoi. In 1974, Coelomyia ctenophora. \n\nIn the conclusion, I can mention that their work includes describing species such as Coelomyia ctenophora, Heteronychia quoi, and Catapicephala sinica, among others. \n\nNow, I need to check the word count. The original main summary is 499 words. Adding a few sentences might push it over, so I need to be careful. Maybe replace some phrases with more concise ones. For example, the part about \"domestic distribution data of Chinese fly species\" can be phrased more briefly. \n\nAlso, the main summary mentions \"Xenotachina (as \\\"sp. n.\\\" in texts)\" which is a bit unclear. Maybe clarify that they described Xenotachina as a new species in their texts. \n\nOnce all the information is combined, I'll read through to ensure coherence and that there are no contradictions. Then, trim any redundant parts to stay within the word limit. \n\nI think that's the approach. Now, let's draft the summary accordingly.\n"}}], "created": 1754034277, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2246, "prompt_tokens": 1320, "total_tokens": 3566, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 1203, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
