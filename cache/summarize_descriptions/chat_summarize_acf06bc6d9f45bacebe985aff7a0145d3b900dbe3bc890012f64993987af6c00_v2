It is documented as a domestic location for multiple taxa, including the **Atherigona reversura**, **Musca autumnalis**, **Protophormia terraenovae**, and **Enneastigma shanghaiensis** (with a specific record in Sheshan). The city is also associated with the **FLY GENUS** and the **genus Adia**, **Eurysthaea**, **Hoa**, **Winthemia**, **Goniophyto**, **Heteronychia quoi**, **Pegomya pachura**, **Pegoplata virginea**, **Cuphocera varia**, **Carcelia kockiana**, **Calliphora axata**, **Ceromyia silacea**, **Graphomya rufitibia**, **Brontaea tonitrui** (type locality), **PIERRETTIA SICHOTEALINI**, **PIERRETIACRINITULA**, **Rhychomyia aberrans**, **Syngamoptera gigas** (type locality), and **1430筒须新怯寄蝇** and **1431家蚕追寄蝇**. Specific districts within Shanghai, such as **Songjiang** (including **Songjiang Sheshan** and **Songjiang She Mountain**), are highlighted as type localities or key habitats for species like **1339上海细麻蝇**, **Bellardia menechmoides**, **Brontaea tonitrui**, **985瓣腹绿蝇**, **Lucilia (Bufolucilia) silvarum**, **Anthomyia illocata**, **Hyleorus elatus**, **Voria ruralis**, and **Delia gracilibacilla**. \n\nShanghai is further noted as a distribution region for **Musca crassirostris**, **Musca sorbens**, **Musca tempestiva**, **Haematobia**, **Lasiomma octoguttatum**, **Leucophora unilineata**, **Leucophora personata**, **Calythea nigricans**, **Gonia picea**, **Fucellia apicalis**, **Fucellia chinensis**, **Delia antiqua**, **Hydrotaea cinerea**, **Achoetandrus rufifacies**, **Bellardia menechma**, **Brontaea tonitrui**, **Pexopsis capitata**, **Phormia regina** (with 1960 specimen collections), **Heteronychia quoi**, **Pegomya cunicularia**, **1430筒须新怯寄蝇**, **1431家蚕追寄蝇**, **斑足莠蝇**, **黄跗粪泉蝇**, **紫翠蝇**, and **732 HEYUAN HUI FLY**. The **Fat-Bodied Greenbottle Fly** (*Lucilia sericata*), **1339上海细麻蝇**, and **985瓣腹绿蝇** are explicitly linked to the city’s domestic regions. \n\nThe city has historical significance in entomological research, including a 1959 study on **Fannia prisca Stein** by Fan Zide and a 1964 completion of a book at the **East China Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences**. Additionally, **Songjiang Shashan** is cited as the type locality for **Bellardia menechmoides**, and **Sheshan** is noted for **Enneastigma shanghaiensis** and **985瓣腹绿蝇**. \n\nShanghai’s biodiversity includes species like **Atherigona triglomerata** (type locality), **Carcelia mikii**, **Goniophyto formosensis**, and **炭黑栉寄蝇Pales carbonata** (per literature). The city is also home to **Pegomya aurapicalis**, **Pegomya pliciforceps**, **Pegomya argacra**, and **Pegomya kiangsuensis**, as well as **Helicophagella melanura** and **Shuangban Jiewei Jiying**. \n\nThis summary consolidates all provided data, resolving minor inconsistencies by emphasizing Shanghai as the central entity and specifying districts or localities where applicable. The city’s role as a type locality and its association with diverse fly species underscore its ecological and scientific importance in China.

The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided about Shanghai and the various fly species. First, I need to go through all the descriptions and make sure I don't miss any. There are a lot of different species and genera mentioned, some with specific locations like Songjiang Sheshan or districts.\n\nI notice some entries mention Shanghai as a city in China, which is straightforward. Others specify districts like Songjiang, which I should include to give accurate context. The key is to list all the species and their distribution in Shanghai, noting any type localities or specific areas. \n\nWait, there are a few contradictions. For example, some entries say \"A city in China\" while others specify \"Shanghai is a city in China.\" I need to resolve that by using \"Shanghai\" consistently. Also, some species are mentioned multiple times, like Enneastigma shanghaiensis and PIERRETTIA SICHOTEALINI. I should check if they are the same or different and mention accordingly. \n\nI should start by stating Shanghai is a city in China. Then, list all the species and genera, grouping them if possible. Mention the specific districts where applicable, like Songjiang Sheshan for type localities. Also, note the studies and institutions, like the East China Institute of Entomology. \n\nMake sure to include all the species names, both in English and Chinese where provided. Check for any duplicates or overlapping information. For example, \"1430筒须新怯寄蝇 and 1431家蚕追寄蝇\" are both in the same entry, so I can list them together. \n\nI need to be careful with the formatting. The user wants it in third person, so avoid using \"I\" or \"you.\" Also, keep the summary under 500 words. Let me count the words as I go. \n\nSome entries have typos or unclear names, like \"PIERRETTIA SICHOTEALINI\" and \"PIERRETIACRINITULA.\" I should present them as given but maybe note if they seem like different species. \n\nIncluding the studies from 1959 and 1964 adds context about research in Shanghai. The institutions and literature references are important for the summary. \n\nI should structure the summary by first introducing Shanghai, then listing the species and their distribution, followed by the research and institutions. Make sure each point is concise and all information is covered without repetition. \n\nCheck if all the species are correctly attributed to Shanghai. For example, \"732 HEYUAN HUI FLY\" might be a typo, but since it's in the data, I'll include it. \n\nFinally, ensure the summary is coherent, resolves any contradictions by using \"Shanghai\" consistently, and stays within the word limit.
