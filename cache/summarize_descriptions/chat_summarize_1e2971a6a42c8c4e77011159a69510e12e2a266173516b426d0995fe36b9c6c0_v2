The genus is taxonomically defined by its **type species, Haematobia atripalpis**, which serves as the reference for classifying members of this group. Morphologically, species within *Haematobosca* are distinguished by several key features: **highly developed eyes** positioned prominently on the head, **reduced or low cheek structures** (the area between the eyes and mouthparts), and **specific antennal characteristics** that contribute to their identification. These traits collectively set the genus apart from other related fly groups, emphasizing its unique adaptations in form and structure. The descriptions provided align in identifying *Haematobosca* as a taxonomic entity with a defined historical origin and diagnostic physical attributes, ensuring a coherent summary without contradiction.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comprehensive summary of the data provided for the entity \"HAEMATOBOSCA\". The data includes two descriptions. First, I need to make sure I understand both.\n\nThe first description says it's a genus of flies with specific morphological characteristics. The second one adds more details: described by Bezzi in 1907, type species Haematobia atripalpis, and mentions high eyes, low cheeks, and specific antennal features. \n\nI need to combine these into a single, coherent summary. The key points are the genus classification, the taxonomist (Bezzi), the year (1907), the type species, and the morphological traits. I should check if there are any contradictions. The first description is more general, the second more specific. No contradictions here, just more info in the second. \n\nMake sure to use third person and include the entity name. The user also wants the summary limited to 500 words. Since the data is short, the summary should be concise. \n\nStart by stating the genus and the taxonomist. Mention the type species. Then list the morphological features from both descriptions. The first one mentions \"specific morphological characteristics\", which the second elaborates on. So combine those. \n\nCheck if \"Haematobosca\" is the correct genus name. The second description uses \"Haematobosca\" and the type species is \"Haematobia atripalpis\". Wait, the type species is in a different genus? That might be a typo. Let me think. If the genus is Haematobosca, the type species should be in the same genus. The second description says \"type species Haematobia atripalpis\", which is in the genus Haematobia. That's conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake here. But since the data is given, I have to work with it. Perhaps the correct type species is Haematobosca atripalpis? Or maybe the user intended to say that the type species is in the same genus. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user provided the data as is. The second description says \"type species Haematobia atripalpis\". So the genus is Haematobosca, and the type species is Haematobia atripalpis. That's a bit odd because the type species should be in the same genus. Maybe it's a typo and should be Haematobosca atripalpis. But I can't assume that. I need to present the information as given. \n\nSo, the summary should mention that the genus is Haematobosca, described by Bezzi in 1907, with the type species Haematobia atripalpis. Then the morphological features: high eyes, low cheeks, and specific antennal features. The first description just says \"specific morphological characteristics\", so maybe the second one is more detailed. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is accurate. If the type species is in a different genus, that's a problem. But perhaps the user intended to write Haematobosca atripalpis. However, since the data states Haematobia atripalpis, I have to include that. Maybe the user made a mistake in the data entry. But as an assistant, I should follow the given data. \n\nSo, the summary will state that Haematobosca is a genus of flies described by Bezzi in 1907, with the type species Haematobia atripalpis. The morphological characteristics include high eyes, low cheeks, and specific antennal features. \n\nCheck for coherence. The two descriptions are not contradictory, just the first is more general. The second provides the taxonomist, year, type species, and specific traits. \n\nNow, write the summary in third person, include the entity names, and keep it under 500 words. Make sure to mention all the details from both descriptions. \n\nFinal check: entity name is correct, all data points are included, no contradictions, third person, and within the word limit. That should do it.\n"}}], "created": 1754042642, "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-32B", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1049, "prompt_tokens": 208, "total_tokens": 1257, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 863, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
